I<font size="+2"><span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">t
was early in the morning when Clarissa was taken out to start her long
series of punishments, beginning by being whipped by five of her fellow
prisoners. The temperature was already high in the nineties and the
guard had assured her that a record one hundred and twenty eight
degrees were expected by mid afternoon. </span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">"You'll be well
cooked by the time you've been out here a few days and then it's the
stinking cell! We've all been shitting in it this last week to make it
nice and smelly for you!"</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">They tied her to
a whipping post right in the centre of the compound where she would be
in the sun all day long. The first girl to whip her was to be Miranda.
Megan would be next, followed by Stella and Debbie and a fifth girl she
hardly knew except by her name of Gertrude. Gertrude was the biggest of
all her floggers and she was flexing her incredible muscles as Clarissa
was dragged out to be secured.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Miranda said.
"Sorry about this, old girl! It was nice knowing you, but I'll find
another playmate soon enough. Enjoy it in the punishment cell! See you
when they let you out for a whipping! Not that you'll see me, of course
with that bandage over your eyes!"</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Warden Kane gave
the order to commence Clarissa's punishment and Miranda raised her arm.
Clarissa could see the shadow as the whip was raised by the one she
loved most in all the world and then the leather cut into her back,
opening her up from hip to shoulder and her heart melted inside her and
she knew she was about to die.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Then she woke up
and saw that she was still in the Warden's quarters recovering from her
extreme dehydration of the previous week! She was covered in sweat and
the sheet was lying on the floor. It was still not light and she turned
over and went back to sleep. This time she did not have that horrible
dream, which had visited her for two nights now. When she woke again it
was light and Wanda was standing over her.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">. </span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Youre looking
better today, Clarissa. You dont have much time left before they take
you to be whipped. You must get away from here very soon or it will be
too late. Im driving the truck today and tomorrow. Ill leave the keys
in the ignition tonight and I wont lock it. All you need do is get out
of the widow to the ground. I suggest you make a rope out of the bed
sheets. The gate will be closed, but dont worry. Drive straight for it
and it will give. Its not too strong and one good push is all it will
need to smash it. Ill try to fix the telephone line so they cant let
the police know youve got away. After that, its up to you. Think you
will be up to it?</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Ill have to be!
I suppose you couldnt arrange some clothes for me to face the world
in? Thought not! Why are you doing this?</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Because I feel
ashamed. I saw how you refused to whip that poor girl in the cage and
helped your friend Stella. And your reward for being a decent human
being is to be punished. I hope you will put in a good word for me when
you get to the Federal authorities.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">When I get
there! If I get there, more like!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">No! Youll make
it, Clarissa! I dont know how, but youll find a way, just as long as
you get out of the prison.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">I hope they keep
me here another day! said Clarissa. Quite honestly, I feel fine now.
Fully recovered. I hope you can convince them I need another day to be
quite ready!</span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">I hope so too!
said Wanda. Your poor back is marked enough after the last time. I
hope those people pay for all the misery theyve caused so many
innocent young women!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">I dont mind my
existing marks too much. replied Clarissa. I feel they were deserved
because of my forgetting about poor Megan in my lust for Miranda. And
the only thing that matters is that Miranda still loves me, even
if I dont any longer have a flawless skin!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Wanda left after
this to drive the prisoners to the work-site and Clarissa concentrated
on appearing wan and weak, despite having never felt better in her
life! </span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">She had a couple
of visits from the warden, who enlarged on her plans for Clarissas
long term future. She was to be given one hundred lashes and kept tied
to the whipping post for one week. Then she would be placed in one of
the punishment cells, chained to the floor with enough play on the
chain to reach the door where her food and drink would be pushed
through to her. The other women would be brought to see her, standing
in her own filth, and when her skin had finally lost all trace of its
suntan she would be brought out, blindfolded and in chains, to be
whipped again and left in the sun for a week. This routine would be
maintained for the duration of her thirty year sentence.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">It was not
difficult to look pale when listening to all this. She asked the Warden
how long she thought she would last in such conditions.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Ill be dead
inside two years, never mind thirty. And youre doing all this to an
innocent visitor to your country, who committed no crime and whose only
offence was to refuse to whip a girl and to help a friend who was ill.
I pity you!</span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">She regretted
this outburst later on when the women had returned from work and
Miranda was brought into the room. The Warden was with her.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Say farewell to
each other. You are fully recovered, despite looking a little pale
after being out of the sun for a few days. Your whipping is tomorrow
and Miranda will be one of the five women who will whip you. I will
leave you alone for two minutes.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Sorry about
this, darling. said Miranda as soon as they were together, holding
Clarissa tightly. I will refuse to do it if you agree</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">No! We cant
have you suffering the same fate as me! Try not to hurt me too much and
afterwards just concentrate on escaping and then well all be free.
Hows Megan?</span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">OK but very
upset about you. The guards have been keeping us posted on what has
been happening. She feels she has failed to look after you, as she
promised. If she had not driven the hired car into the pothole she says
you would both be safe and well at home again. I try to tell her not to
blame herself, but shes very low in spirits right now. And Stella is
upset at all the things she said about you.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Youd better go
now, darling! It wont do any good if you stay any longer. I love you
more than I ever thought it possible to love another person, and I
always will!</span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">The two kissed
one last time and Clarissa was left alone to spend her final night in
comparative luxury before starting out on a life of utter misery. She
doubted that her friends would ever make it without her and if she was
to avoid her fate she must do something tonight!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">As soon as it was
dark, she went over to the window. Only one of the watchtowers had a
view of the Wardens accommodation and a searchlight beam moved
across the window every fifty seconds. She had been disturbed by this
in the early days of her recuperation but was used to it by this time.
The truck was fifty yards away, silent and waiting to transport the
women to the rock-breaking next day. She tried opening the window and
found that it was extremely stiff, but she managed to lift it high
enough to get through without making a noise. Looking down, she saw
that it was indeed too far for her to jump. She would need to use the
two sheets to form a makeshift rope long enough to reach near enough to
the ground for her to be able safely to jump the final few feet .</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Needing the
sheets for a rope, she would have to abandon her idea of wrapping
herself in one of them. Once on the ground she would have no time to
waste untying one, even if she could reach high enough. Slowly and with
extreme care, she dragged the heavy bed across to the widow. It was
heavy work and she was covered in sweat long before she was finished.
Then she went to the en-suite bathroom and stuck her head under the tap
and drank as much as her stomach could hold. She turned on the shower,
cooled herself off and then made for the window and her desperate bid
for freedom.</span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">She waited until
the searchlight beam had passed the windows and quickly climbed down
the improvised rope. As she had feared, it was impossible to untie one
of the sheets in the time she had left, so she ran, still naked, for
the truck and climbed into the driving seat. She almost lost valuable
seconds by making initially for the wrong side, forgetting for a second
that she was in one of those countries where they drive on the right!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">It took her a
couple of seconds to work out how to switch on the headlights, and then
she started the engine and drove straight for the gate. As Wanda had
predicted, the flimsy construction gave way, shattering into many
fragments of pulverised wood. It was a mercy that this was not a real
prison, she thought, but some relic of the past used by the mad Elders
as a place to house wayward and sinful women!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">While lying on
her bed, planning her strategy once out of the compound, Clarissa had
decided on trying to drive the truck back to the road she and Megan had
been travelling along and going back to the last town they had stopped
at. If she ran into the patrol car, she would try to ram it! All
seemed to be going well at first. She reached the road after three
hours and, by the time it was beginning to become light, was within
thirty miles of the town. Then she saw the blood!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">In the excitement
of her escape she had not felt the pain as a bullet fired from the
watchtower struck her upper arm. The bullet had passed straight
through, missing the bone, but she was bleeding badly all the same.
Looking down at her feet she saw that she had lost quite a bit of blood
already. The sooner she got medical attention the better!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">She was now only
twenty miles away from the town when the trucks engine showed signs of
distress. After another two miles it gave up the ghost altogether and a
weary Clarissa climbed out to see if she could fix the fault, whatever
it was. Although she had never had to do anything like this before, she
had some mechanical knowledge. But it was no use. The fuel tank had
been nicked by one of the bullets and was now empty. Becoming fainter
by the second in the heat and with the bleeding showing no sign of
stopping, she found a can of fuel in the drivers cab and emptied it
into the tank. Another five miles and the engine stopped again.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">A passing
motorist - a true Good Samaritan - saw the naked blonde weakly
signalling for him to stop. This was a lonely stretch of road where
there was ample cover among all the rocks for accomplices to lie in
wait. Others had already driven past, thinking that Clarissa was an
obvious decoy, and she was becoming increasing desperate.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Gee, what
happened to you, honey? he asked, taking in her condition at a glance.
Well get you do a doctor, fast!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Phone the F.B.I.
as well! Ive been kidnapped and escaped. There are many other women
also being held. </span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Then she passed
out.</span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">*********************************************</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">How are you,
Stella? asked Miranda.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Miranda, Megan,
and Stella were lying, staked out in the prison compound. Megan
had lost her clothes on her first day and now Miranda and Stella were
also naked and had been told they would stay this way, even when and if
they were freed. It was dark at last and the temperature was almost
bearable by now. The three had just been fed on their diet of bread and
water. It was five days since Clarissas noisy and dramatic exit and
still there was no sign of a rescue. All three were beginning to fear
that something bad had happened to their friend.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">She must have
been wounded and bled to death. sobbed Megan. Im sure I heard shots
when that truck was bursting through the gates. If shed got help wed
be free by this time.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">She might have
been hurt and too ill to speak. When she gets better she will tell them
about us. Try to look on the bright side, Megan. replied Miranda who
felt almost as tearful herself.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Stella said
nothing. Of the three, she was faring least well and the other two were
getting worried about her.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">As soon as the
prisoners had been mustered, the day after Clarissas escape, her cell
mates had been accused of complicity in her breakout and immediately
Miranda and Stella had been stripped (none too gently) and all three
stretched out and pegged to the ground in the blazing heat with no food
or drink all day.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Youd think
those pea brains would realise none of us three could have been
involved in this! As if we could have cut the telephone wires for a
start! said Megan. I think we can all guess who was Clarissas
helper!</span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">When the Warden
finally wakes up, its going to be a hard time for poor old Wanda -
thats for sure! said Stella. And maybe shell let us three go.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">She wont free
me! said Miranda. I was the last person to speak to Clarissa before
her getaway. But I sure hope they let you two go!</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">These words of
Miranda were shown to be true in the morning as Stella and Megan were
untied and allowed to rejoin the work party in their march to the
work-site. Now that the truck had been stolen, there was no transport
other than a couple of small trucks.</span><br
 style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">You stay here!
snarled the grinning guard. A few more weeks in the sun will be good
for you!</span><br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: batang; font-weight: bold;">Minutes later
Wanda, also stripped, was dragged out and secured next to Miranda,
where Megan had been lying until just recently. One way and another,
the compound was getting to look a veritable scene of human suffering
by this time. The girl escapee still languished in the cage and now
that Wanda, the only guard who let her out at night once in a while,
was herself a prisoner she would stay cooped there twenty four hours a
day until taken to the cell. And her friend was still tied down on the
other side of the compound to where Miranda was. Wherever the women
looked, there were signs of the terrible fate that awaited any one
stupid enough to be thinking of leaving!</span><br
