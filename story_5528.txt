The phone rang and woke me up. I looked at the clock, surprised.
I hadn't meant to fall asleep. I picked up the receiver and
stretched.

"Hello?" I yawned. The heat was already starting to spread
through my body again. Charlie told me to put my hand in my
panties, so I did.

"Hello, Miss Kingston," said a familiar voice. "This is Doctor
Pines."

I quickly yanked my hand out of my pajama bottoms. Doctors had a
way of knowing about these things.

"Um, hi."

"How are you feeling?"

"Fine," I replied. "Just a little sleepy." Charlie wanted me to
take my clothes off, but I ignored her. This was not a good time.

"Have you started the new medication yet?"

The pills were still in the unopened bottle. "Yes," I heard
myself respond. "This morning." Why had I said that? It must have
been the right answer.

"Very good. That's probably why you feel tired. Take naps if you
need to, but remember to take two tablets every twenty-four
hours. We don't want any more incidents. Do we, Miss Kingston?"

"No." I felt ashamed. Doctor Pines was a nice guy. He was only
trying to help me. I made up my mind to start the medication
right after I got off the phone.

"Okay then. If you have any trouble, call my cellphone. I have it
with me at all times."

"I will. Thank you."

He said goodbye and hung up. I went over and picked up the bottle
of pills. It was round and long and kind of heavy. I held it for
a minute in my hand. Charlie told me that I should take it, so I
did. It felt a little cold at first, but after a while I didn't
notice.

Peter called me around six. I let the machine get it. Charlie was
asleep and I wanted to relax.

"Hey Erica. That photographer from Cosmo is still hassling me.
She wants to know when you'll be ready to shoot." I groaned and
threw a pillow at the phone. I wasn't ready to go back to work
yet. I needed rest. Charlie whispered that I should go to Los
Angeles. It sounded like a very good idea.

Five hours later I was on a plane to L.A. The flight was full and
the seating was all messed up. I wanted the window seat next to
me, but a boy got it first.

"Hi," I said, smiling at him. "Would you mind trading seats with
me?" He looked maybe sixteen and was wearing thick glasses.

He blushed and got up quickly, nearly stumbling as he moved past
me. I held his arm to make sure he didn't fall. He starting
blushing even more. It was cute. I thanked him as I sat down and
looked out the window. This was much better. I could relax now.

The plane took off. I leaned back and closed my eyes, but Charlie
kept me awake. I looked out from under my eyelids. The boy was
watching me. I saw his eyes moving slowly over my body. His hand
was on the arm rest closeby. He suddenly looked very nervous. It
took me a second to realize that it was because I'd reached over
and touched his wrist. Then Charlie told me to move it, so I did.

His hand trembled as I brought it between my thighs. I felt
guilty. Doctor Pines would not have approved. The boy's fingers
did feel good rubbing the front of my jeans though. I wondered if
I could pull them down without anyone noticing.

I unbuttoned my pants and worked them down a little. I put his
hand back, this time over my panties. I moaned quietly as I felt
his fingers start to stroke me. Charlie was telling me to take my
shirt off. I wanted to, but I still remembered what had happened
that time on the bus. Embarrassing. I took the boy's hand again
and guided it under my panties. His fingers rubbed deliciously
over my labia, his hand shaking so much that it felt almost like
a vibrator.

He suddenly pulled his hand away. I looked up to see the
stewardess serving a drink to the man on the end of the aisle.
Could she see that my pants were undone? I sat still, hoping she
would leave. In a few minutes she did and the boy immediately put
his hand back on my kitty. I was starting to like him.

He played with me until his whalish mother came over and pushed
her way down the aisle. I moved my purse into my lap and smiled
at her, but she only gave me a sour look. Bitch. She looked back
to the boy and frowned. His face was pink and he was breathing
heavily.

"Mercy!" She said, putting her hand to his forehead. "Don't you
have your inhaler?"

"I do, mom." He answered, sounding mortified. "I'm okay. Honest."

She felt his hands and looked at his eyes. "Okay, but if you
start having trouble remember that we're just three rows behind
you." She smiled at him and walked away. He was just reaching
over again when his mother suddenly came back.

"Go sit with your father," she told the boy sternly, glaring at
me from behind her glasses. Shit. When he had gone she sat down
next to me and leaned over, her face ugly and twisted.

"Does this smell familiar, you little slut?" She snapped, waving
her fingers in my face. I felt my cheeks start burning as I
caught the faint musky scent of myself. She must have picked it
up from her son's hand.

"I thought so. What I should do is tell the captain and have the
police haul your child molesting ass away as soon as we land."
Her voice was very loud. I shrank down into my seat and tried to
hide. She scowled. "You're just lucky I don't want to embarrass
Rodney."

Too late for that, I thought, but I didn't say it. The woman
easily outweighed me by a hundred pounds and I was afraid she
would sit on me. Charlie pouted and said nothing..

"Sorry," I said weakly. She just stared like she was trying to
melt my head with her eyes. She watched me for the rest of the
flight. So did a lot of people. I felt like I was going to die
from shame.

Fuck you, Charlie. You did it again.

The first thing I did when I got to the hotel was go to my room
and search through my bags for the pills. No, that's not quite
right. That was the second thing. The first happened in the
elevator. The bellhop was at the end of his shift and looked
tired, but he was still nice to me and insisted on carrying both
my bags. Charlie told me that I should do something to thank him,
but I didn't listen. Wait. That's not quite right either. I
didn't listen right away. Then I decided that it would be okay to
just kiss his wiener a little bit. He looked pretty surprised as
I got down on my knees in front of him, but he didn't seem to
mind. A second later he hit the stop button on the elevator.

I opened his pants and took him out. His penis wasn't very big,
but it was smooth and clean and quickly getting hard. I kissed it
a few times, then forgot what I was supposed to be doing and
starting sucking it anyway. I was curious to see if I could put
the whole thing in my mouth, so I tried. It fit nicely. He was
very stiff and I could feel him twitch each time I took him all
the way down.

I was just beginning to have fun when he groaned and started
squirting. Not wanting to get us in trouble, I swallowed it. I
did his pants back up as he started the elevator again. At my
door I offered him some money for carrying my bags, but he
refused.

"Lady, you already gave me the best tip I've had all year." He
grinned, and with a nod he left. I started to feel ashamed again.

Enough was enough. I had a career to think about. I searched
through all my stuff, then dumped my bags out on the floor. The
pills were nowhere to be found. I was almost positive I'd brought
them with me.

I gave up and changed into my pjs. Self-control. That's all I
needed. I went out on the balcony. The night was warm and the
lights looked pretty. I was still hot from the elevator ride.
Charlie told me that I would feel better if I was naked, and I
reluctantly agreed.

Once my clothes were off I leaned on the railing and looked down.
I was on the seventh floor and could see that there were still a
lot of people out walking. What day was it? Saturday. I
stretched, enjoying the breeze on my skin. Charlie said I should
touch myself. I frowned and thought about it for a moment. Well,
okay, but just a little. I reached up and gently squeezed my left
breast, rolling the nipple around between my fingers. A tiny
shiver ran through my body.

Suddenly I heard voices nearby. There were a few young men
standing out on the balcony next door. One had seen me and was
pointing. I felt my face getting warm. I knew they could see what
I was doing, but I didn't feel like going back inside. Moving my
hand over to pinch my other nipple, I looked back down to the
street and tried to ignore them. My kitty was almost aching to be
touched. I slipped my hand between my thighs and gave myself a
few slow rubs. It felt nice. I leaned over further and spread my
legs so I could reach myself better.

More voices. I wasn't paying attention. My fingers moved faster.
I rested my head against the railing and moaned.

"Yeah baby!" Someone called. "Work it!"

I exploded. It was strong and I heard myself cry out. People were
clapping. I looked up to see close to a dozen men and women
standing out on the balcony next door, applauding me. Oh God, not
again. I ran back inside my room and closed the door.

I went to the bedroom, suddenly exhausted. Charlie was quiet. I
would sleep until she woke me again, and in the morning I would
find the the sheets all tangled up like a wild animal had been
trapped in the bed.
