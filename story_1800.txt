<b><font size=+2>Gwendoline had to postpone
her marriage after the sudden death of her father just after Christmas&nbsp;
and her inheritance of his title and estates.&nbsp; She had been incredibly
busy for the first few months, moving into her parent's apartments and
out of her own small but beloved flat in the upper floors.&nbsp; Her mother
had gone to live in France with her sister. There had been some very hard
financial decisions to take and negotiations with the Estate Duty Office.&nbsp;
It was not until February that she had got things on to an even keel.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harriet, meanwhile had returned to her cottage in Devon
and terminally quarrelled with Bill to her great relief.&nbsp; Bernie had
been right, a boy was no substitute for a real man.&nbsp; She still had
her ambition to be a manual worker but soon discovered that it is not easy
to be a woman in a very macho man's world and even less easy for the posh-accented
daughter of an aristocrat. She was beginning to slip back into her&nbsp;
old hedonistic routine when in early&nbsp; February after the journey's
end the phone rang and Gwen was on the other end.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Hi darling.&nbsp; How's the search for back-breaking
toil?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Not very well, I'm afraid, Gwendoline.&nbsp; It seemed
such a good idea when I thought of it, but it's not an easy thing for a
toffee-nosed snob like me to get into - AND I'm a woman."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Come up to Hampshire and stay awhile.&nbsp; I may
be able to help.&nbsp; Come now - this minute"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harriet leapt into her car after throwing some clothes
into a suitcase and was ringing the bell of Gwendoline's stately home a
few hours later.&nbsp; It was answered by Jenkins, an imperturbable looking
man&nbsp; in the traditional garb of a butler.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Lady Harriet?&nbsp; Her Ladyship will see you upstairs.&nbsp;
She instructed me to say you may undress down here and follow me upstairs
when you are ready.&nbsp; She further instructed me to say that there was
no compulsion - she merely thought you might like to for old times sake.&nbsp;
You may undress in the drawing room."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>An amazed Harry followed this apparition into the drawing
room and removed all her clothes.&nbsp; When she emerged,&nbsp; the unflappable
man showed her upstairs and ushered her into a room on the very top floor,
announced her&nbsp;&nbsp; in a sepulchral voice and retired with majestic
dignity, as if this kind of thing happened all the time.&nbsp; (in a way,
it did under Gwendoline's new and eccentric management)</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwendoline was standing on the top rung of a ladder
and removing some dusty old files from a high shelf.&nbsp; She was quite
naked and covered in dust.&nbsp; This room must have been unused for decades,
if not centuries.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>When she had climbed down, she cried out in delight
and put her arms around her friend, squeezing her to her breasts and eagerly
pushing her lips against hers, hungrily&nbsp; inserting her tongue into
Harriet's&nbsp; mouth in a well remembered demonstration of affection.&nbsp;
Same old Gwen!</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I'm just going through all these old registers.&nbsp;
Hundreds of years old, some of them.&nbsp; All in a shambles.&nbsp; They
need cataloguing and all sorts of things like that.&nbsp; Might be very
valuable, some of them - but I'd hate the tax-man to know that!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You want me to help with them?" asked Harry.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Hells bells - no.&nbsp; I've got some outdoor work
on the estate all lined up for you.&nbsp; I'm going to have a large swimming
pool and YOU are going to dig it for me!&nbsp; And you don't have to wear
clothes - aren't you the lucky one?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Have you been getting out lately Gwen?&nbsp; It's
several degrees below freezing out there.&nbsp; You cannot be serious?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Now where have I heard that phrase before?&nbsp; Yes,
darling I'm quite serious.&nbsp; You must be getting soft to ask a question
like that!&nbsp; We'll have no more of that nonsense.&nbsp; You get your
clothes back when you leave this house and not before.&nbsp; Let's go to
bed for a bit, dear old Harry - I feel tired!&nbsp; And&nbsp; we've a lot
of catching up to do.&nbsp; We can have sheets and blankets if you&nbsp;
like for a day or two until you get back into the old routine."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"No thanks, Gwen.&nbsp; I'm not that soft!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Scrumptious!&nbsp; Lets hit the sack!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>&nbsp;As they lay together, Harriet asked Gwen about
her life.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"When are you getting married, Gwen?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>In June, darling.&nbsp; Big society wedding, you're
going to be a bridesmaid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck knows what creep Jim will have
for his best man.&nbsp; Some of his friends,&nbsp; Harriet - what a crew!&nbsp;
You wouldn't believe it.&nbsp; And I don't who who's going to give me away
now that darling Daddy is gone."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Do you still see anything of Janet, Gwen?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I see everything of her, but only now and again.&nbsp;
She was here last week.&nbsp; Look closely at my belly and you can still
see the marks.&nbsp; What a woman!&nbsp; Hard as nails - but I'm not soft
- not by a long chalk!&nbsp; She still thinks she can make me cry off first
- fat chance of that, Harry my love!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Any way let's just enjoy each other, shall we?&nbsp;
You're my favourite girl now that Jessie is a married woman and has all
these boring notions of lifelong fidelity, and Janet is strictly a very
part-time pursuit.&nbsp; I'm sorry to see you've started shaving again
Harry.&nbsp; I don't want any more of that when you're staying here.&nbsp;
Don't worry - I know you'll be a bit stubbly for a while, but you'll look
so much nicer with that lovely red down on those strong legs of yours and
that sweet red bush that I want to bury my nose in again.&nbsp; Be good
to me, darling and do as I say!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Let's finish making love" she continued, "and then
go down and get something to eat.&nbsp; It should be ready in an hour and
a half.&nbsp; Now come here&nbsp; and let's get to know each others lovely
secret places again!&nbsp; You do smell so good, Harry!&nbsp; Breathing
in the odour of that darling body of yours is like drinking champagne,
only much, much better!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>On their way down to dinner, for which they did not
dress, despite being waited on with all due formality, Gwen explained that
Harriet's duties would begin as soon as it was light.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I'll come&nbsp; with you and explain what needs doing
and then you're on your own out there until mid-day when you come in for
lunch. You can have an hour and a half and then go on till it gets dusk,
which is about five.&nbsp; I don't want any excuses about it being too
cold.&nbsp; I hate it when you whine, Harry and I won't have it.&nbsp;
You can have your own sleeping quarters if you like, but I'd like it very
much if you slept with me as long as Jim is not around and Janet is not
here.&nbsp; How does that sound, my strong and muscular manual worker?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>&nbsp;"I'll give it a go, Gwendoline, but it IS bloody
cold.&nbsp; Just let me see how the first day goes - eh?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Next day, the two nude friends walked out into the
freezing February morning.&nbsp; Harriet had not felt the ground under
her bare feet since she had delivered the partially recovered Gwendoline
to this same mansion a week after that gruelling&nbsp; fight, when the
brave girl had taken on seven fighters&nbsp; one after the other, and beaten
them all.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>It came as a fearsome shock to feel the icy cold air
on her skin and her heart sank to think that she would be out here for
the next four and a half hours.&nbsp; She looked sideways at her friend
and saw that she was seemingly unaffected by the cold.&nbsp; She didn't
even seem to have any gooseflesh, unlike Harry, whose skin was covered
in tiny little bumps.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwendoline pointed to where she had marked the outline
of the proposed new pool, and instructed a shivering Harry to put the soil
in one barrow and any large rocks and stones in another.&nbsp; When full
the barrows were to be wheeled across the extensive lawns to a distant
spot where Gwen intended to use the spoil to build a rockery.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Pick-axes and shovels had been laid out and Harry was
left alone, already feeling very much more than half-frozen, as Gwen stalked
imperiously back to the house, her fine young bottom undulating appetisingly
as she went.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Deciding that she must get her circulation going quickly
or perish, Harriet picked up a pick axe and attacked the ground vigorously.&nbsp;
The tool seemed to bounce&nbsp; straight off the iron hard soil and flew
out of her hands - this was not going to be an easy morning!&nbsp; She
retrieved the implement and next time she was careful to hold it more firmly
and a few bits of soil and some stones were dislodged from the ground.&nbsp;
A few more blows and she was beginning to&nbsp; make a bit of headway and
the first indentation began to appear.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>She soon appreciated that a spade would make absolutely
no impact on this frozen ground.&nbsp; The pick axe was to be her only
tool as long as this cold snap continued.&nbsp; She continued to attack
the earth and in an hour or so there was enough to fill one of the barrows
with soil and she wheeled it across to the distant&nbsp; future rockery,
the long frost covered grass crackling under her bare, numbed soles. In
her battle against the cold, her body was beginning to make a fight-back
and she almost started to enjoy herself.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>By the time noon came she had transported three loads
of soil and one of rocks and the hole was three foot square and a couple
of feet deep.&nbsp; She was quite satisfied that she had done so much in
such trying conditions, when Gwendoline came stalking towards her.&nbsp;
She looked at Harriet's handiwork with distaste.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Ye Gods,&nbsp; Harry!&nbsp; Is that all you've done?&nbsp;
What do you think, this is, Harriet?&nbsp; A rest cure?&nbsp; Forget about
lunch.&nbsp; I'll send Jenkins out with a sandwich and a flask of tea -
or coffee if you prefer and don't take up too much time eating it.&nbsp;
You can stay out here until it gets too dark to work.&nbsp; I'll see if
I can't get some floodlights installed and you can have more time out here.&nbsp;
Well, Harriet - get on with it!&nbsp; Try putting your back into it, use
some of that muscle you've let get so flabby."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>With these hurtful words Gwendoline again stalked away
and&nbsp; again the toiling Harriet saw that arrogant bottom gyrating its
imperious way back to the house and a warmth which Harry longed for.&nbsp;
Gwen's recent ennoblement had obviously done nothing for either her temper
or her humility, but her loveliness was not undiminished, it was enhanced
and Harry was so much under her spell again that she redoubled her efforts
in her anxiety to please.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Round about one o'clock the servant, Jenkins came out
with a picnic basket and a rug, followed by Gwendoline.&nbsp; He laid out
the rug on the grass and spread out the contents of the picnic.&nbsp; There
was mulled wine and delicious looking sandwiches and chicken drumsticks,
canapes and other tempting goodies.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Jenkins retired,&nbsp; relieved to be out of the cold,&nbsp;
regretting that the ancient house had fallen into such lunatic hands since
the death of the old Earl.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwen motioned an amazed Harry to sit down and start
eating.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I've always loved picnics, Harry.&nbsp; haven't you?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harriet observed that she had not&nbsp; often been
to&nbsp; picnics in the nude, except during their journey last autumn and
never when it was four degrees below freezing, at a conservative estimate!&nbsp;
The wine warmed her enough to enable her to sit still long enough to finish
eating and the fumes rising to her head anaesthetised her so that the cold
retreated from her body, leaving her with an unexpected sense of well-being.&nbsp;
She nestled up to Gwendoline and rested her head against one of that girl's
firm breasts.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Maybe you're not such a hard-hearted employer after
all, Gwen!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Would you like to do this every day, Harry my love?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>She heard herself saying she would love to, and wearily
realised later on that she had just been talked into being out in the cold
all day and every day from then onwards.&nbsp; She'd better start toughening
up and fast, she resolved or she wouldn't see another Spring!</font></b>
