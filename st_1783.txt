<br style="font-family: antigoni; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
<big style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span
 style="font-family: times new roman;">"I wonder why Lisa isn't back
yet?" asked Samantha of nobody in particular at about this time.
(Lisa's twelfth week away) She had been looking forward to having her
friend back weeks ago.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"They've added some extra
weeks to her punishment, Sam!" It was Sandra, that veteran of solitary,
who answered her." It's so easy to slip up in your first days! And
remember Lisa was new to prison life. By the time she'd learnt the
ropes and come to appreciate just how strict things are here, she was
bound to be looking at maybe four weeks more, just in her first day. If
she'd been a bit more used to this life and then been sent down to
solitary, she'd have done a whole lot better."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Sandra was going through
one of her frequent guilty periods again. "Just her rotten luck to fall
foul of an idiot like me on her first day. I could kick myself whenever
I think about it. But she'll be out soon. I get the feeling she's no
fool. She'll have taken herself in hand by now and we'll have her back
in the next bed to you before too long!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"I hope so!" said Samantha.
She was a girl of&nbsp; Lisa's age and most of the others here were
older than she. It had been like a breath of fresh air when the fresh
and fragrant Lisa had plonked herself onto the next bed and smiled that
sweet smile at her! Well, she'd be a little less fragrant now!</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Six more weeks went by and
Samantha was getting beside herself. But Sandra was unmoved.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"She could easily have
incurred twelve weeks penalties in her first month, Samantha. I was an
old hand when they slung me in there but I still got five more weeks.
It takes time to adjust your thinking and sharpen up. Don't fret! It
shouldn't be too long now. She'll be back in a month - maybe a lot
sooner!"</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">&nbsp;Samantha nodded
glumly. Sandra knew what she was talking about. Her time in solitary
had indeed been lengthened and Lisa WAS very, very green and the guards
would make absolutely no allowance for the girl's inexperience, coming
down like a ton of bricks on the least infringement, callously
adjusting the time switch whenever she did something wrong. She was
just learning the hard way - like all the others. Except that the
others weren't getting it anything remotely as hard as poor old Lisa!</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Eight weeks after this,
though, there was nobody in the dormitory who doubted that Lisa was in
some kind of serious trouble. The general view was that she was ill.
Sandra confirmed that prisoners in solitary received no medical
treatment. They were isolated from all human contact for the duration -
no matter what. Samantha plucked up the courage to ask to see the
governor, since none of the regular guards seemed to have a clue. She
almost wet herself as she was ushered into his office, which she had
never seen before. He asked her what was her problem.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"It's a girl I made friends
with, Sir. Lisa is her name and she got into trouble on her first day
and is in solitary. It's just that it's been twenty six weeks and she
ought to have been out after eight for a first offence. I wondered if
she has been taken ill. I'm sorry to disturb you, Sir. But I really
liked her and I can't sleep at nights for worrying about her."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">The Governor smiled in a
kindly way. He liked Samantha, who would be out in less than three
years, with all the remission she had earned by her exemplary
behaviour. He went to a filing cabinet and looked at his records. When
he looked back at Samantha his face was grim.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Her offence was a triple
one, Samantha. I'm sure you know what that means. And I decided that
she should also serve the sixteen weeks that her lie almost cost
Sandra. In her first month she committed&nbsp; a number of offences,
each of which cost her an extra week's confinement. But she has learned
to control herself by now and is becoming a model prisoner! All being
well, she will be back with her comrades in ninety two weeks!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Five minutes later, a
concerned governor saw Samantha's eyes open. He looked relieved. He
could be a stern man when it was called for, but it still came hard to
him to have to be so strict with the fair sex!</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"I am sorry to have made
you faint. I had no idea that this prisoner could have had such an
effect on you in so short a time. I am sorry you miss her, but the
rules are the rules. If it makes it any easier for you, I will break a
rule and show you your friend and you can see that she is in good
health. Come along!"</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">The kindly governor took
Samantha, sniffing and sobbing over the other side of his office and
opened a sliding door. Behind the door were three TV monitors. Each
showed a confined inmate standing naked in a tiny space. She recognised
Lisa straight away.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"She looks very well, Sir.
I was afraid she might have been taken ill. Her hair is lovely. It had
been shaved off before she first came here and was only just starting
to grow again. But she looks very healthy, although it's a little
difficult to see much of her features from the angle the camera is
trained on her."</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Samantha gasped. Lisa had
just turned her head up. She would frequently vary the monotony by
looking up at the ceiling, guessing correctly that by so doing she
would be looking directly into someone's eye! She was always careful to
have no expression on her face. She feared that any sign of emotion
might be interpreted as defiance and she was determined not to be
defiant. She never lost sight of the fact that she was being justly
punished for an act of weakness that disgusted her the more she thought
about it.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">She continued to look at
the ceiling and Samantha continued to look down at her.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Is she naked all the time,
Sir? And she's having her period. It's awfully gruesome, leaving her
like that at such a time. Couldn't you slip something through to her?"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">The governor shook his
head. Total nudity meant just that as far as he was concerned. But it
was certainly a mess and he made a mental note to ask once of the women
staff what she thought.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"I suppose it's quite warm
in her cell, Sir" asked Samantha, getting braver all the time.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Ten degrees. It's been
that for twenty weeks and she looks fine on it, doesn't she. You said
how healthy she looked."</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Yes, Sir. She is
surviving. She must be really special. She looks so calm and serene.
And more lovely than ever. I don't think any one has ever been in there
as long as she has. I really admire her. I haven't any courage, Sir,
and she has enough for an entire army!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">The governor indicated that
the interview was over.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"So what did you learn
Sam?" asked Sandra after work that evening. "You look pretty cut up!
Bad news?"</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Just about as bad as it
gets! She got the book thrown at her, Sandra. Nobody in the whole
history of this prison has ever been awarded as long in the cooler as
Lisa. You were right about her getting extra weeks. Every time she has
her period they give her a week for messing up the marble floor of her
nice clean little cell. I'd no idea those punishment cells were so
tiny. It's inhuman! I don't blame you for not wanting to go back. I
would kill myself sooner than go there!&nbsp; I got to see her on the
monitor. She looks fine - more sweet than ever!&nbsp; And she is naked
the whole time in that freezing cold!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"How cold, Sam?"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Ten degrees. How can she
take that? But she seems to, all the same!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Sandra looked grave.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"They're treating her a lot
worse than they did me. Maybe the rules have been tightened up. Mind
you,&nbsp; I was nude the whole time - that's the rule. But they kept
the cell warm enough - say fifteen degrees. It wasn't exactly boiling
in there, but you could take it! And I got issued tampons when I was
there.&nbsp; Tell me everything, Sam!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Samantha suppressed a sob
and went on. "He said she will be back in ninety two weeks time. He
said she's a model prisoner now after a difficult time to start with.
She was given twelve extra weeks in her first nine weeks. But apart
from the curse, she never gets awarded more weeks any more. It's so
unfair, Sandra! She did a despicable thing blaming you for starting the
fight, but she pretty soon made up for it! Maybe it was just to get the
other women off her back, but I think it was more a matter of honour
with her. She knew right away she'd done wrong. If only she'd discussed
it with me first, I'm sure we could have worked out a better way of
putting things right."</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Sandra agreed. It was
putrid that Lisa should be kept in that awful confinement for so long a
time. She had been happy to hear that they had&nbsp; put her away for
eight weeks and not in any way sympathetic when she had, as she
thought, got about twelve extra weeks on top - that was par for the
course and a snitch did have a debt to pay. But she would have been
there for&nbsp; two years and four months by the time they let her out.
Almost certainly more. So she would only have a few months to get to
know this girl well and she admired her more and more and wanted to
enjoy her company for longer than a couple of all too short months.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"I'll go to the governor!"
she said. "After all, I did provoke her and strike the first blow and
Lisa was bloody courageous hitting me back and keeping on coming even
though I was half killing her! I'll tell him the truth and maybe he'll
relent and agree to let her out sooner - a lot sooner!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Samantha sniffed again and
looked a bit happier. So the governor had a second visitor in as many
days!</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">He listened to Sandra
carefully. Then he froze her blood with his precision.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"I agree that it seems
likely that you started the first fight, but she did offer to take the
blame and she could have turned the other cheek and averted this whole
tragedy. If she had, then the whole incident would have blown over and
nobody would have been harmed. Her reasons for taking the
responsibility sound quite strong to me and are her own affair. If she
had kept quiet I should have had no alternative other than to hold you
both responsible and have you caned or given extra work. I gave her a
punishment for lying. But what you say makes no difference to that.
Either way she is a liar, either by accusing you or by taking the blame
herself. As for the second fight, I am sure you know as well as I that
those two women have been released. Why did you not come to me earlier
when they were still on the premises and could be questioned? I fear
that her punishment must stand. However, in view of your admission I
award you sixteen weeks. Never mind! As an experienced inmate you will
survive without extra penalty and be back in circulation many weeks
before Lisa! You may return to your comrades as for now, but will
report to the solitary block at seven in the morning."</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"What will the conditions
of my confinement be, Sir?"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"You will be told in
detail, but I think the temperature will be appreciably lower than in
your last stretch. We are having to economise!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"As long as I suffer what
Lisa does, I am happy!"</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">The governor laughed dryly.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">" Maybe you would like to
choose a cell! Come and look!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">He motioned Sandra to a
plan of the isolation unit. There were six cells, only one of which was
usually in use at any one time. Because of Lisa's long sentence, there
were three in at present.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Those other two will be
out in five weeks. They were fighting, in another wing - the one for
our own girls where English is not spoken. They were both keen to claim
responsibility for starting it so they both get four weeks (we let them
share the eight weeks). With a few penalties, they will be out before
too long and then you and Miss Griffiths will have the suite to
yourselves.&nbsp; But even if you are neighbours you will not be able
to talk. If you even try to it will mean more time and the walls are
VERY thick and soundproof! Come and see Lisa. I will not be showing her
to any others of the prisoners, but you and Samantha are special
friends!"</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">And Sandra became the
second prisoner to have an unauthorised view of the unfortunate Lisa.
Like Samantha before her, she was amazed to see how fit she looked. She
mentioned this to Governor Menendes.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Yes. She exercises herself
each day. And we cannot keep such a long-term prisoner on reduced
rations as you will be. It would permanently damage her health. She
usually walks up and down a lot but this week she is standing over the
floor level toilet all day. But at night the floor becomes smeared and
she will be punished for that, even though it is hardly her fault. I
don't make the rules."</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"What punishment, Sir?"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"Only a week extra for
every period. I agree it seems unfair. Your friend Samantha was upset
about it and I am looking into the matter. I think you will approve of
my decision when I reach it!"</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Sandra went back to the
dormitory and told Samantha she was about to lose another friend for a
while.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">"It's only twenty four
weeks, Sandra. You must be brave and think how glad Lisa would be to
have such a short time!"</span><br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Sandra tried to look
convinced. She was quite petrified. The sole day of her second period
in solitary had been sheer horror, but Lisa was coping and so must she.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">At a quarter to seven, she
went across the prison yard to the low-lying building whose
unimpressive exterior held in its depths so much human misery. She was
in good time and had a five minute wait before hatchet-face and an
assistant, a Chinese lady, came to open up. Sandra wondered if Lisa
realised that she was left alone all night down there in that suite far
below the ground. Not that it made any difference as she could not be
reached by the two guards and was being watched twenty four hours a day
on a monitor in the guardroom. In effect the internees here were buried
alive and she, Sandra, was about to undergo the same fate, thanks to
her vain attempt to get a reduced sentence for Lisa, who seemed to be
coping fine from what she had seen, certainly better that she would in
the next twenty four weeks.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">As soon as she had been
taken to the reception hall she was ordered to strip. It had been warm
up on top in the outside world and as she stood naked to have her
orifices inspected, she shivered, breaking out in a rash of gooseflesh.
The two staff took much more trouble over probing Sandra's anus and
vagina than they had with the virginally innocent Lisa. Even this
hardened thirty year old was sick with disgust when they had finished
with her. Hatchet Face removed her latex glove and took out the list of
rules. Sandra was read out the familiar spiel. They had not changed
much in the last three years, except for the lower temperature. It
would be an uncomfortable twenty four weeks and the weather would most
likely be chilly when she had finished her punishment. And when she
returned to normal prison life she would be bare breasted to face the
elements. She wondered what clothes Lisa would be left wearing after
her three separate punishments. Probably just her briefs! But since
nobody had ever been down here for three sessions, Lisa would be
breaking fresh ground, both after as well as during her ordeal.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">Fifteen minutes after being
taken down below,&nbsp; Sandra was in the next cell to Lisa. She might
as well have been a thousand miles away, of course, and for the first
week, Lisa was not much in her thoughts as she tried to adjust herself
to this most feared and hateful of situations. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">She cursed herself time and
time again for her utter stupidity. Fancy picking on that new girl!
Once you had spent a session down here you NEVER stepped out of line
again! She shivered in the sixteen degree temperature for her first
three days and then found it becoming bearable. After ten days it
seemed normal. By the time it had gradually dropped to ten degrees she
was relieved to discover that she could still function and survive. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">She tried at first to do
the sort of exercises that Lisa was doing next door to her, but her
reduced diet made her too weak and she found that all her strength was
needed merely to remain upright for sixteen hours. Like Lisa, she
overcompensated during her first couple of weeks, getting up hours
earlier than necessary and spending eighteen or even nineteen hours
upright instead of the still taxing sixteen and the resultant loss of
badly needed sleep was wearing her out. Then one day she overslept and
missed her breakfast, getting herself an extra week. Finally, after
four weeks she had her routine adjusted.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman;">For all the time she was
buried alive she never lost her sense of panic-stricken despair and it
was always an effort to stop herself crying and going down on her
knees. Where Lisa had found it possible to invent her own inner
reality, Sandra never forgot where she was. Those four walls, two of
them close enough to touch at once, were never out of her mind.</span><br
