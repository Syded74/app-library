"Please, Emmie. You must help me," Irene insisted.
"With what exactly?"
Emmie looked away from her computer screen and tried to decipher what her colleague wanted this time.
"Distracting Jake. I really need to talk to Dave."
"Why don't you just invite him to lunch."
"No, that would be too obvious."
"And this isn't?"
"Look, I'm sure that you can make up with something to get Jake off the scene. Please. I really need to talk to Dave. He looked **so** handsome this morning," Irene sighed.
Emmie wanted to sign as well. What was it with her blonde, young colleague and that stupid IT guy, Dave? They were adults on their birth certificate, but sometimes she had some serious doubts about their mental age.
Emmie was just a year older than Irene, but mentally Emmie felt as if they were decades apart. She wondered if she had ever been as stupidly in love as Irene tended to be. Usually, Irene was after the guys in Marketing, but for the last few weeks, Dave from the IT department, had been at the very top of her most-wanted-list.
It was a pity that Dave shared office with a colleague that scared away most people. Irene included. So, that's where Emmie came into use. Boring Emmie, with her dark blonde hair and her quick remarks. Now acting as canon-fodder for grumpy men with bad social skills.
It was just a pity that the man she was supposed to fool, was one of the most handsome men she had ever come across. If he hadn't been so grumpy, he would probably have women lining up behind him. And Emmie feared that she would be one of them.
For such a young man, she wondered what made him so hard-headed and cranky. In fact, between the easy-going Dave and no-nonsense Jake, she would probably prefer Jake.
He was a much more interesting character, but he would never notice her. With her short figure and mousy appearance, she passed under the radar of most men.
Still, that didn't trouble her. She had a comfortable life and a few good friends including Irene even if they had quite different personalities.
"Oh, I'm so in love, Emmie, can't you tell?" Irene droned on.
And that was the only reason why Emmie decided to help. Again.

Irene ran into the office of Dave and Jake.
"Oh, please Jake, could you help Emmie? Her computer is totally ruined. And she's so worried because she needs to run the monthly report."
"Not again," Jake mumbled. "What has the silly chit done now?"
Dave just laughed.
"Sounds like an emergency, buddy."
"Hell no. She can fix it herself."
"Oh no, you must help her. She's in a real uproar," Irene insisted.
"Find another idiot to fix it. I've had it with her hysteria and stupid errors."
"But she insists on having your help, Jake. Please," Irene prodded on.
"Some women shouldn't be allowed to have computers," Jake sighed.
"A damsel in distress is just in your area of expertise, Jake," Dave smiled. "Besides, it's your turn to handle support issues this week."
Reluctantly, Jake grabbed his mobile and headed for the door.
"I bet she's trampled on a cable. Simple as that."
"Don't be too sure," Dave laughed behind him. "She's quite inventive -- and clumsy. A real support challenge, if I ever saw one."
Hilarious, Jake thought. That woman was an expert in ruining his day.

"Okay, so what's all this fuss about?" Jake asked while yawning.
The tall dark-haired man was making her office feel over more cramped than usual, Emmie thought. But the fresh scent of an attractive man was even more disturbing. Concentrate, she commanded herself. Concentrate on distracting him more than she was.
She had promised Irene that she would keep him occupied for as long as she could. It would not last long. He was good-looking, but he had very little patience with other people. And he had no qualms in showing exactly how bored he was either.
He came off as gruff and not very approachable. Not the sort of person that should be working on a help desk, Emmie thought. But since they took turns handling the support desk, he had to do his share.
Usually, Emmie would stay well away from someone like him, but ever since Irene had started her campaign for Dave, Emmie had come across Jake on an almost daily basis.
Despite his gruff appearance, she had discovered that there was quite an interesting person underneath. She just had to extract it a little more. So, it helped to act stupid. That irritated him so much that it was starting to get entertaining. Emmie went for it.
"Oh, I'm so sorry to drag you away from your morning sleep," Emmie said with irony and tried to act the hysteric woman that the situation demanded. "But this monster won't do anything."
She pointed at her computer screen.
"I'm sure that it holds a grudge for me and know that this is the perfect time to go crazy."
"Computers don't have feelings," Jake explained.
"Well, I beg to differ. This one does, and whenever I have some important task it's deciding to grow a spine."
"Have you tried to reboot?" Jake said slowly, as if he was not sure she would understand.
"As if **that** will solve anything?" Emmie said as she raised her voice slightly.
A squeaking woman would probably get on his nerve and give Irene a little more time.
"We're already disagreeing, and I don't want to lose the data that I have."
"You forgot to save?" Jake sighed.
"I can't do that all the time. It ruins my concentration. And right now, I can't even find the stupid save button."
"Try the upper left corner."
"But I can't see anything. The screen is black. Just see for yourself."
"Well, turn it on again."
"Don't you think I've tried that? But the damn thing is having a grudge. Ever since I downloaded the latest issue of Vogue, it has been moody."
Jake just sighed.
"Can't blame a fellow for not liking women's magazines, can you?"
"Well of course I can. He's supposed to do my bidding!"
"He?"
"Well of course it's a 'he'. No female can be so stupid," Emmie argued.
"Wouldn't surprise me," Jake mumbled.
"What did you say?" Emmie wondered. "You're mumbling."
"Just thinking out loud," Jake intervened.
"As long as you don't start patting him or something," Emmie said suspiciously. "He doesn't deserve any favours after ruining my day. Do you know, I might even miss the latest episode of the 'Kardashians' if he keeps this up? The boss insists on having this report before I leave today. I'll probably end up writing it on paper instead."
"Sounds like a good idea," Jake agreed.
"You think? But how can I keep tabs on my 'Facebook' friends if my computer doesn't work?"
Emmie could barely hold back a smile as he seemed to struggle to control himself. She twirled a curl in her hair as she waited for him to explode or lose his temper. He seemed to be counting to ten very slowly.
"Haven't you fixed it yet?" Irene inquired as she hurried inside and went to her desk.
"It's user-related," Jake stated with a bored tone in his voice.
"No, it's not!", Emmie protested. "It's that stupid piece of junk that's trying to ruin my day."
"Man, you really need a reboot," Jake said ironically.
"I'm not a man. And you're not blaming this disaster on me!"
Emmie was irritated. The nerve of the man.
"Have fun then," Irene said quickly. "I'm going out for lunch. See you later," she winked at Emmie as she passed her. "Thanks," she whispered.
"Okay," Jake sighed as if he tried to regain his patience. "Let's remove some clutter and start with the obvious."
With a slow movement, Jake came closer to her.
Emmie eyed him suspiciously. What was he up to now?
Without saying a word, he put his hands on her waist and lifted her as if she was light as feather. She felt his body much closer than he had ever come before, as he pulled her toward him. Just as quickly he sat her down at the far end of her desk, before turning toward her computer.
Emmie just sputtered. How dared he put his hands on her without even breaking a sweat or seem just a little affected by it. And he had even called her 'clutter'. How dared he?
"I beg your pardon! You could have asked nicely. Instead of just moving me around as if I was some sort of furniture."
She felt like sprouting fire at the man.
"You took too long."
"I hope you sprained a muscle in the process. Or hurt your back."
Emmie glared at him as she wrapped her arms in front of her chest, heaving for breath at the unexpected treatment.
She refused to acknowledge the fact that she enjoyed the feeling of being swept off her feet by a strong and handsome man.
Jake laughed heartily. Emmie had seldom heard him laugh before, and she was momentarily shocked. She liked the sound of his laughter, even though it was on her behalf.
"Don't count on it, missy. With a feather-weight such as you? I'm not a weak computer geek that can barely lift a mouse."
Jake turned and looked at her, his eyes sparkling with laughter.
"Says who?" Emmie challenged him.
"Ah, you need further proof," Jake smiled as he grabbed her and lifted her up and held her against his chest.
Emmie could hardly breathe. She was shocked, and ever more so when she looked up into the face of Jake. His mouth was so close that any woman might get ideas, Emmie thought. Her breasts were flattened against his chest and she felt a strong need to wrap her legs around his waist, no matter how much her skirt would object to that.
This would not do. He mustn't get any ideas that he could control her so easily with his body. Then she would lose, and she refused to let him have the upper hand.
She placed her hands against his chest and pushed herself away from him. Only to realize that the result was that their lower regions came closer together.
She was shocked as she could feel the outline of his cock against her stomach. He was so warm, she suspected that it would take hours for her to cool down again. And just as sudden she felt him hardening and increase in size.
She gasped aloud this time, and she noticed that he had a thoughtful look in his eyes, as if there was some mystery that he didn't have the solution for yet.
Jake moved his abdomen slowly against her, as if he was rubbing himself on her.
"How high would you like me to lift you?" he asked with a look of triumph.
Emmie was annoyed and lifted her legs as if she planned to kick him where it hurt the most.
"Let go of me, you moron!" she sneered at him, and just as suddenly, he dropped his grip on her and she fell to the floor.
It happened so sudden that she forgot to support herself, and before she knew she landed directly on her bottom. Her skirt moved upwards as she toppled backwards on the floor.
"Ouch. Why the hell did you do that?" Emmie asked as she turned on her side to massage her aching backside.
"Ladies orders," Jake just grinned as he seemed to enjoy the view of what the skirt had been hiding.
"There was no need to grab me in the first place."
Emmie tried desperately to pull her skirt down and put her legs underneath her. His ministrations had reduced her muscle control into nothing, it seemed.
"Let me give you a hand," Jake volunteered as he pulled her onto her feet in one quick motion.
She waggled a little, before finding her momentum. A large strand of hair had loosened from her hair pin and she tried to push it back into place.
"Ahem, you might want to fix your blouse first," Jake suggested with grin.
He pointed toward her chest, and looking down, Emmie saw that a few buttons has come loose, and her bra was visible through the opening. She blushed and quickly turned away from him. The cold air against her bum told her that her skirt was not quite where it was supposed to be either, but at the same time his hands were on her waist and he pulled her skirt into place.
"Now you're decent again."
"And whose fault was that? Just because you wanted to make a statement as to how much of a he-man you are."
"Whoa there! It was you who didn't have the strength to stand on your feet, remember? Maybe I should lift you again so that you get all the details correct this time."
He moved toward her again, his hands aiming for her waist.
Involuntarily, Emmie jumped backwards, before he managed to grab her again. She crashed into the desk behind her, and with an affronted yelp, she rubbed her aching backside.
Jake gave her a triumphant smirk that rattled her very core. Emmie straightened her stance.
"Why do every situation have to turn into a childish pissing contest with you?" Emmie flung out, having completely forgotten her decision to act the stupid-user-game.
"Pissing contest? It's nothing of the sort. These muscles don't come easy you know," he smiled as he flexed the biceps on his right arm. "You have to work for them."
"Huh! Looks more like too many wasted hours at the gym, if you ask me," Emmie interceded.
"So, spending time in front of a TV is better?" Jake challenged. "I suppose it's mentally challenging as well?"
"It depends on the show," Emmie insisted.
"Sure, right. It doesn't seem like you've learned many fashion details yet," Jake concluded as he ran his eyes over her body from top to bottom, lifting his eyebrow slightly.
Emmie knew that her grey coloured business outfit was probably too mousy and boring to suit him. She always wore an A-line shirt that covered her knees, and paired with a white blouse, it was meant to be business-like, but not attractive. She remembered the buttons in her blouse and quickly buttoned all of them up to her throat.
She was surprised that he did notice and comment on her clothes. She had always thought he was too busy with his computers to notice anything else.
"What?" she prodded him to explain.
"Or learned the benefit of showing some naked skin. You should have left your blouse buttons open, by the way. It looked at lot better."
"Huh. What would you know? With your head inside a computer the entire day."
"Hah, I'm still a man, remember? Besides, what man does not like to look at a woman's tits?"
"Sounds as if you 're quite the regular to some other sort of internet pages."
"Just spell it out, missy," Jake said calmly and looked at her with a glint in his eyes. "No need to be shy."
"I'm not shy," Emmie said between clenched teeth.
She felt her temper rise and she refused to back down.
"But there's a difference between being coarse and having an intellectual conversation."
"You should show more cleavage. No man cares how clever you are."
"You're such a chauvinist pig!"
Jake laughed.
"I'm just like any other warm-blooded man. A cleavage is so much more interesting than brain power."
"Hah! So, you admit that you're easily fooled?"
"No, but it helps in providing a nice view."
"Sounds as if men in general are just plain stupid, if you ask me," Emmie challenged.
"Never underestimate your instincts," Jake smiled. "I have a gut feeling for which women are worth taking to bed."
"My goodness! Its sounds as if you're using the wrong brain. What happened to rational thought and weighing the pros and cons?"
"Naw. If she can't turn me on, it's no use bothering with the rest."
"Sounds as if you have an easy existence without exerting your brain power."
"I have to since my workdays tend to focus on helping stupid users solving stupid issues," he said while giving her a tell-tale look.
"You IT guys really need to work on your manners. You're supposed to be service minded."
"Show off more skin and you'll be surprised how service minded I can become," Jake suggested with a smirk.
"That just proves my point. You need to get your head out of the porn sites and concentrate on earning your salary," Emmie said icily.
"You think so?"
"Yes. It's as if you expect me to crawl in order to get your help."
"Good idea. When will you start?"
"Forget it! I would rather eat vermin."
Jake just laughed heartily, and Emmie felt more annoyed than ever.
"Oh, never mind. I'll just borrow someone else's computer since you're not helping," Emmie turned and started to walk away.
"Sounds like a plan," Jake agreed. "Now, try this one," he stated as he grabbed her by the waist again and dumped her into Irene's chair.
"Will you just stop manhandling me like that!" Emmie sputtered as she jumped up from the chair again.
"It's not my problem that you move too slow. But since the problem seems to be solved, you should finish that report."
"Report?"
"Yes, the report that you were nagging about. Maybe it wasn't so urgent after all?" Jake asked while he lifted his eyebrow in a telltale movement. "Or would you rather that I manhandle you in a more interesting way before I go?"
Emmie gasped as she took in his meaning. He was getting on her nerves. As he always did.
"Never mind. I have more important things to do than to talk to you," Emmie said icily.
"Excellent," Jake smiled and shrugged his shoulders.
He walked passed her and gave her bottom a pat as he did.
"Feel free to call me next time you've a problem. I'll bring pen and paper."
Emmie gave an affronted sound, as she watched his broad back as he briskly walked away.
Damn the man. He always made her feel like an idiot.
Besides, Jake was smiling. That did not bode well, Emmie thought. He was completely out of character.
And she had finally been noticed, even though she tried to stay under the radar. Thanks to Irene, they would never get any more help from the IT department.
Emmie sighed and turned to her computer.
Quickly she adjusted the lights and she started working on her report. How many more favours would Irene ask of her before she landed that suitor of hers? Emmie hoped this was the last time. Today, their discussion had suddenly turned in a sexual direction, and she was not sure that would be a good idea.
It was just a matter of time before Jake would see through their theatrics, and then he would have every reason to be angry. She preferred to stay far away from him when that occurred. Why should such a good-looking guy be so unnerving?

Jake returned to his department and noticed that all his colleagues were gone. Typical. They were probably off to lunch. A look at the time confirmed his suspicion. The silly chit had done it again. Led him on a wild goose-chase just before lunchtime. There was something going on here.
A pattern seemed to emerge, and he had a few suspicions as to what caused it. In the beginning it had seemed to be quite ordinary support calls, but lately they seemed more concocted.
He had wondered whether it was him she wanted to see, but she never gave him any indication about that. In fact, she didn't seem to like him very much, although for a brief moment she had melted against him when he lifted her. He smiled at the thought. Maybe there was a sparkle of interest there after all.
Then he had discovered that Irene seemed very attracted to his co-worker Dave, and he had put two and two together, and realized that it was all a set-up.
He hated to be at the receiving end of a joke, and he had decided to make it a little more unpleasant for her. Maybe she would stop wasting his time then.
In fact, todays encounter had taught him that there was lot more to her prim and grey-coloured posterior. Almost as if there was another and much more primal sort of person underneath. At least there was some benefit from all the nagging and strange errors.
And he had discovered that he enjoyed rubbing her the wrong way and watch her spine straighten. She was a lot more interesting once she got heated up a little.  
An alarm sounded from mobile. Damn, one of the servers was down.
He hurried into the cafeteria and grabbed a sandwich before he headed for the server room.

Having restarted the server and making sure that it stayed on, Jake finally had a few moments to spare. A headache had started to form, and he realized that he had forgotten to drink any coffee. He strove toward the coffee machine as another call ticked into his mobile.
Her again? These support weeks were a nightmare, Jake thought. Never a free moment. He grabbed his coffee before heading to an office he knew very well.

"Are you trying to beat a record?" Jake asked grumpily as he stood in her doorway and sipped his coffee.
"No?" Emmie answered not understanding what he meant.
"So, you're just trying to ruin my day then? What sort of hare-brained issue have you figured out this time?"
"Hare-brained? You're in the wrong department. We only have intelligent issues here," Emmie countered.
"This one just ticked into support: 'Computer error,' and your name again."
"Can't be me. Who reported it?"
"Ah, Irene, again."
"There you go. Not me. And as you see there's no problem here."
Jake looked at her computer screen.
"So, you got it up and running again?"
"No thanks to you, mister. But since we use our upper brains instead of the lower regions, I figured it out."
"Let me guess, you'd cut the electricity and discovered how to reconnect it?"
Emmie felt insulted. But, after all, she had made some serious efforts as to prove to him how stupid she was, so it shouldn't come as any surprise that he was finally convinced of the fact. She wanted to knock him off his high horse once and for all, and she knew just the solution for it: the element of surprise.
"Oh yes, that was probably my stilettos that caused that."
Jake looked down at her feet, probably noticing a pair of low-heeled boots. They were more for comfort than for fashion, Emmie knew, and he didn't seem convinced.
"Which stilettos?"
"My party shoes. I only put them on when I'm off duty."
"Can I watch?"
"Sorry, they're at home right now."
"Too bad. You should bring them tomorrow."
"You think so?"
"Yes, high heels make a woman walk sexier."
"Is that a fact?"
"Just try and you'll see."
"Well, thanks for the excellent advice. I never suspected that I had to talk to the service desk in order to get fashion tips."
"Any man knows about sex appeal."
"I'll be damned. And here I thought you IT nerds were only flabbergasted by CPU's and graphic cards."
Now he looked completely stunned for a moment.
"How did you learn to talk so sexy?" he inquired.
"I'm a quick learner, remember?" Emmie said lightly but knew that she had just blown her own cover as stupid-user-with-no-IT-knowledge.
He moved closer and sat on her desk. Emmie backed her chair slightly away from him, feeling a little awkward with his large body being too close to her. She could almost feel the warmth coming from his body and she looked at his muscular thighs outlined by his jeans.
She let her eyes roam upwards, moving quickly away from the interesting bulge in his crotch, before taking in the sight of his muscular arm halfway clad in a blue shirt.
He had rolled up his sleeves, and she watched in awe how his tanned skin moved and how his muscles tensed as he leaned some of his weight on his arm.
He looked at her with an intensity that didn't bode well, as if he was trying to analyse her thoughts and mind down to the smallest detail.
"You seem to have more to you than meets the eye, missy. Wonder what else you're hiding behind that sombre facade?"
He moved his hand slowly up her arm, lightly touching her skin.
"Maybe you're even hiding a wanton woman in there, just waiting to be free?"
Emmie jumped up from her chair and backed away from the temptation that he presented. Standing up, she was more at eye level with him. He was too tall, she knew, but sitting down made her feel really small compared to him.
"If so, I doubt that you'll be involved in the process," Emmie bit back.
"Never say never," he smiled smugly, before he grabbed his coffee cup and walked away.
