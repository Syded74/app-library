He was helping move some<br>  of his elderly Father's furniture when the middle finger of his<br>  right hand got caught between the shelf he was carrying and the<br>  door frame. A quick trip to the hospital and Tom's middle finger<br>  was in a brace.</p><p>As injuries go, the finger was pretty minor, but being right-<br>  handed Tom quickly found a world of inconveniences. verything took<br>  a little longer to do, and some jobs were nearly impossible without<br>  at least a little thought.</p><p>He was complaining about it to his friend Gayle during an instant<br>  messager session.</p><p>Tomcat: Busted my finger today - it's making typing a bitch</p><p>Gayle Force: Oh no! Are you going to be all right?</p><p>TC: Yeah, but I can tell it's going to be a frustrating six weeks -<br>  Lots of things I can't do.</p><p>GF: Anything I can do to help out.</p><p>TC: Well there is one thing - ah never mind.</p><p>GF: What?</p><p>TC: I could use a hand at one thing, but I doubt you'll agree.</p><p>GF: Again, what?</p><p>TC: It involves lubricant...</p><p>GF: Sure.</p><p>TC: I'm joking of course.</p><p>TC: Wait, did you just agree?!?!</p><p>GF: Yes.</p><p>TC: You realize I just asked you for a hand job?</p><p>GF: Yes.</p><p>TC: God. Now I'm beat red and my heart is pounding.</p><p>GF: lol</p><p>GF: I win!</p><p>After logging off, Tom couldn't get the exchange out of his head. <br>  She couldn't be serious could she? It wasn't as if he really<br>  needed someone to jerk him off - his left hand was perfectly OK;<br>  plus, he has an assortment of toys to get himself off with.</p><p>The problem was that Tom and Gayle were &quot;just good friends&quot;, which<br>  is to say Tom would have dropped everything to have sex with Gayle,<br>  but Gayle didn't see him that way. Tom was the archetypical urban<br>  nerd and Gayle liked country boys. Tom knew it, so he limited his<br>  attraction to surreptitious glances and double entendres. They<br>  flirted, and they both knew that a flirt was not a promise.</p><p>Or at least, that was what Tom thought until that night online. <br>  Now there was a glimmer of hope for something more. Normally this<br>  would fuel a week's worth of masturbation fantasies. But this<br>  time, Tom went to bed hard and untouched. He drifted off imagining<br>  Gayle's hands on his cock.</p><p>The next day, work proved to be as difficult as he had thought it<br>  would be. Working with a computer all day necessitated that he<br>  relearn how to type with one finger out of action. By the end of<br>  the day his hand was cramped in addition to the dull ache in his<br>  finger. He also had to contend with a general buzz of low-level<br>  horniness all day. Every time he thought about his hand, he also<br>  thought about Gayle's promise (in his mind it had grown from a<br>  throwaway line to a promise). Despite the cramp in his palm, Tom<br>  signed on when he got home and immediately noticed that Gayle was<br>  online.</p><p>GF: So how was your day.</p><p>TC: It was OK, my hand was giving me problems, but I'm learning to<br>  cope.</p><p>GF: Is it throbbing?</p><p>TC: Nah, more of a dull ache radiating from the fracture.</p><p>GF: I wasn't talking about you hand.</p><p>TC: Oh that - well, it's only been two days since my last, uh,<br>  session. I'm not desperate yet.</p><p>TC: Although I am looking forward to a helping hand.</p><p>GF: I bet you are.</p><p>TC: I haven't quite decided if you're a tease or a NightinGAYLE.</p><p>GF: Oh, definitely a nightingale.</p><p>TC: And how can I know that for sure?</p><p>GF: I'm a good girl...</p><p>GF: ...with kinky bits.</p><p>TC: Coming to the party tomorrow?</p><p>GF: Of course - I'll have some happiness just for you.</p><p>Tom signed off and just sat there. Every sentence in their chat<br>  session had sent a rush of blood to his groin and now he was rock<br>  solid.</p><p>&quot;My drop-dead gorgeous friend is going to give me a hand job<br>  tomorrow&quot; he thought. He resisted the urge to whack off right<br>  there, instead going to bed. It was a long night, the thoughts<br>  that raced through his head prevented him from relaxing enough to<br>  fall asleep. Eventually, exhaustion set in and he passed out. He<br>  dreamed of Gayle's body, her face, her legs, her ass - but mostly<br>  he dreamed of her hands.</p><p>At the party the next day, Tom thought &quot;Ok, just keep it cool,<br>  you're two friends out with a bunch of other friends having a good<br>  time. She was probably just kidding, so don't make a pest of<br>  yourself.&quot;</p><p>Gayle had shown up wearing a short skirt and a tank top. A<br>  combination that made the most of her long legs, small breasts and<br>  spectacular ass. A belly button piercing and multiple bracelets<br>  topped off the ensemble. Also along was her young son.</p><p>&quot;You know we're going out clubbing tonight don't you? I don't<br>  think your six year old will get past the bouncer.&quot; said Tom.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I'm sorry about that, Something came up and I have to take<br>  him to Edmonton. Can I have a rain check for the dancing? I know<br>  it was last minute, but I thought I'd at least make an appearance<br>  before I left.&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;That depends, do I get a rain check too?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course, I'd never leave you... short handed&quot;, she giggled.</p><p>Was her smile just a little more impish than usual, Tom thought,<br>  or is it just my imagination.</p><p>&quot;Do I at least get a good-bye hug?&quot;</p><p>She held her arms open and Tom rushed in. They hugged warmly. As<br>  they held each other, Tom whispered &quot;I had no idea you could be<br>  such a tease&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Count on it&quot; she whispered back.</p><p>They let go of each other and Gayle turned to walk back to her<br>  truck, where her son were waiting, oblivious to the exchange taking<br>  place.</p><p>&quot;I thought you were a nightingale?&quot; Tom said.</p><p>&quot;I can be both&quot;, she replied.</p><p>Monday night, they chatted again on line.</p><p>GF: So how was your weekend?</p><p>TC: Pretty good, I got to see some friends I hadn't seen in a long<br>  time, I had some banked hours at work so I took Friday off, and I<br>  didn't even have to help my Dad finish moving on account of my<br>  finger.</p><p>GF: So it was a 100 percent good weekend?</p><p>TC: Well, there was one small part of me that was disappointed.</p><p>GF: I hope it isn't that small a part. lol.</p><p>TC: It's been six days without for me, I'm starting to get pretty<br>  frustrated.</p><p>GF: *GASP* six days?</p><p>GF: You mean you've been waiting for me?</p><p>TC: Well, yeah.</p><p>TC: I want it to be a good one - I don't get opportunities like<br>  this very often.</p><p>TC: It's getting hard to wait though.</p><p>GF: I bet it's getting hard. Can you wait until next weekend?</p><p>TC: Are you serious, I can hardly wait until supper time.</p><p>GF: Wait until this weekend, and I guarantee it will be a good one.</p><p>She signed off before he could reply.</p><p>Another week he thought? The conversation had definitely crossed<br>  the line from teasing flirt to verbal foreplay. Tom hoped Gayle<br>  and he were on the same wavelength - he'd hate to wait that long<br>  just to have her say she wasn't serious. Frustration was one<br>  thing, but combining it with an embarrassing faux pas was quite<br>  another.</p><p>It was a long week and Tom made it even longer by jerking off<br>  every night. With a Herculean force of will he managed to stop<br>  before coming. He didn't know what was coming over him - it would<br>  obviously be less frustrating to leave his anxious cock alone, but<br>  he couldn't help himself. Every time he was on the brink of orgasm<br>  he would imagine how much better it would feel if it was Gayle's<br>  fingers wrapped around his shaft. Her hand slick with lube sliding<br>  up and down.</p><p>He found himself staring at women's hands a lot more, imagining<br>  them slowly masturbating him. In just ten days he had gone from<br>  never thinking about hands at all to seriously fetishizing them.</p><p>At the same time, the frustration was making him strangely eager<br>  to please every woman he talked to. He went out of his way to be<br>  extra polite to them all. It attacked a few comments from his<br>  coworkers</p><p>&quot;You certainly are cheerful today&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's almost Friday&quot;, said Tom.</p><p>&quot;Got big plans for the weekend do you. Going out of town?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nope, I just think It's going to be a great weekend.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, his nightly chats with Gayle had become strangely<br>  chaste - she never mentioned their weekend plans, and when Tom<br>  surreptitiously tried to bring it up she would feign ignorance or<br>  suddenly have to sign off.</p><p>After an eternity, Friday came. As soon as Tom was off work, he<br>  phone Gayle.</p><p>&quot;Hello&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Hey nightingale - mind if I come over tonight?&quot;, asked Tom,<br>  trying to sound casual.</p><p>&quot;Sure - I sent Dylan to see his cousins for the weekend and I<br>  definitely have plans for you. When you come over, dress casual -<br>  in clothes you don't mind losing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, Ok. Seems like an odd request for a first date though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who said anything about a date - I plan on putting you to work<br>  painting the kitchen. You can do that one-handed right?&quot;.</p><p>Tom stood there, mouth open with his phone against his ear.</p><p>&quot;Hello? Are you still there?&quot; asked Gayle.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, um, painting - I've got some coveralls.</p><p>Crestfallen, Tom made his way home to get a change of clothes, and<br>  from there went to Gayle's. The whole way there, he felt like a<br>  fool for assuming anything could ever happen between the two of them.</p><p>Gayle was waiting at the door when he arrived. She was wearing<br>  cutoffs and a grubby T-shirt, both had specks of green paint on<br>  them. A handkerchief kept paint off her auburn hair.</p><p>&quot;Hi, I saw you coming up the street so I came to open the door&quot;,<br>  she held the door open for him, &quot;You can change in the bathroom. <br>  In addition to painting, I have a fine meal of Thai take out<br>  prepared.&quot;</p><p>They exchanged more pleasantries as Tom moved to the bathroom. He<br>  changed into his coveralls and came out.</p><p>&quot;Well, we look like quit the pair don't we - I'm the bald guy from<br>  the American Gothic painting, and you're Daisy Duke&quot;, said Tom.</p><p>&quot;We're painting - we don't have to look like fashion models&quot;,<br>  replied Gayle.</p><p>&quot;Common, follow me&quot;, she said, gesturing as she turned towards the<br>  kitchen, &quot;Watch your step.&quot;</p><p>Tom followed her closely, keeping an eye out for misplaced boxes<br>  and furniture - but also keeping half an eye on her rear end. <br>  Suddenly, in mid stride, Gayle stopped and took a step backwards. <br>  Without enough time to stop, Tom bumped into her. Gayle continued<br>  backwards, pushing her ass into his crotch.</p><p>Smiling back at Tom, she said, &quot;Oops, sorry about that - thought I<br>  was going to trip.&quot;</p><p>Once again, conflicting thoughts flooded into Tom's mind. Was<br>  that deliberate? Was there going to be anything other than<br>  painting and Thai food on the menu tonight? Was he imagining<br>  things? Tom's cock had no such worries - it was now standing at<br>  attention, ready for Gayle to move backwards again.</p><p>Throughout the evening, Gayle was very forward. She smiled,<br>  touching him often and seemed to be bending over an awful lot more<br>  than was strictly necessary. Bending away, she would give her<br>  backside a little wiggle, bending towards him she would jut her<br>  chest out, her nipples revealing that she was bra-less. It was all<br>  subtle enough that Tom wasn't sure what was going on. But it did<br>  make the evening go fast.</p><p>Afterwards, the mixed messages continued.</p><p>&quot;It's awfully late - maybe you should spend the night?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, I'd like that&quot;, answered Tom.</p><p>&quot;Ok, I'll get you some sheets for the couch.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe I should go home after all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, don't do that - I'll cook crepes tomorrow as a thank you for<br>  all the help&quot;, she said as she slid a hand up his arm.</p><p>&quot;Well, Ok.&quot;</p><p>Later, in the wee hours, Tom finally fell asleep on the couch. <br>  The previous hours being equally spent on frustration and self-doubt.</p><p>Gayle woke him up the next morning.</p><p>&quot;Wake up sleepy head&quot;, she said leaning over him, &quot;We've got a<br>  busy day ahead of us - I promised my brother I'd rescue him Dylan<br>  at three o'clock.</p><p>Gayle was wearing a plush bathrobe and her hair was wrapped in a<br>  towel.</p><p>&quot;What time is it?&quot; asked Tom.</p><p>&quot;Time for you to have a shower - that would be nine o'clock for<br>  you geeks.&quot; she said, &quot;The downstairs shower isn't working, you'll<br>  have to use mine upstairs.&quot;</p><p>Tom got up and wrapped the sheet around him.</p><p>&quot;So we're having pancakes?&quot; he said, still a little bleary.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I've changed my mind about the crepes, I have a better<br>  breakfast in mind - go have you're shower.&quot;</p><p>Tom went about his morning ritual, he freshened up and had a hot<br>  shower The heat (and Gayle's shower massage) removed all the kinks<br>  his shoulders had developed sleeping on the couch. The water<br>  running down his front also reminded his cock that it had had no<br>  attention in quite a while. He gave it a few soapy strokes before<br>  resuming.</p><p>Drying off afterwards, he wrapped himself in a towel and walked<br>  out into the bedroom.</p><p>&quot;Gayle, have you seen my overnight bag, I thought I'd left...&quot;, he<br>  came up short by what he saw.</p><p>Gayle was kneeling on the bed, acing him. She was wearing<br>  panties, a red corset and black elbow length gloves. The panties<br>  shone like silk and were thin enough that they couldn't possibly be<br>  practical - only decorative. The corset accentuated her already<br>  fantastic figure and pushed her breasts up and out. A thin gold<br>  chain connected both of her erect nipples.</p><p>&quot;Are you ready for your hand job now?&quot; she asked, one eyebrow<br>  crooked.</p><p>Tom stared speechless at the vision in front of him. His heart<br>  raced and he could feel himself blush from his face to his chest.</p><p>Gayle stepped off the bed and sauntered towards him. &quot;What's the<br>  matter - cat got your tongue?&quot;</p><p>She walked around behind him and took his hands off the towel that<br>  was wrapped around him.</p><p>&quot;I don't think we need this do you? It's certainly not doing<br>  anything to hide you hard cock.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is this?&quot; Tom finally managed to stammer out.</p><p>&quot;Silly, It's the prelude to the best hand job you've ever had of<br>  course.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You've been such a good friend, and ever so patient with me&quot;, she<br>  said as she guided him to the bed, &quot;Imagine, almost a whole two<br>  weeks without getting off. I can barely go two days without<br>  myself, I can't imagine how frustrated you must feel. Lie down now.&quot;</p><p>Tom lay down on the bed. Gayle leaning over him she grabbed a<br>  leather restraint.</p><p>&quot;Do you trust me?&quot; she asked, holding the restraint up.</p><p>&quot;What's that for?&quot; asked Tom, now a little nervous for reasons<br>  other than his sexy friend.</p><p>&quot;It's to keep you from ruining a truly spectacular morning. You<br>  know I like a little bit of bondage - this is your opportunity to<br>  find out why.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not so sure about this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't worry - if there is anything, and I mean ANYTHING that<br>  makes you feel uncomfortable, you can just say your safe word and<br>  I'll let you out.&quot; She whispered into his ear. Giving the earlobe<br>  a little lick, she continued, &quot;what is your safe word anyway? Pick<br>  something that doesn't normally come up in conversation.&quot;</p><p>It just popped into his mind, unbidden. &quot;Rutabaga&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Rutabaga it is then.&quot; Gayle secured first one wrist, then the<br>  other to the headboard with her restraints. &quot;Let me know if that<br>  restraint is bothering your hand and I'll adjust it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's fine. To be honest, it's not my hand that has my attention<br>  right now.&quot;</p><p>She smiled at him. &quot;I bet there are other parts of you that are<br>  just aching.&quot; She moved to the footboard and attached restraints<br>  to his ankles.</p><p>&quot;Here's the thing about safe words - Saying 'rutabaga' means I'll<br>  stop and release you, no questions asked. It also means the<br>  session is over. I promise you, this will be a day to remember,<br>  but only if you don't chicken out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ok&quot;, Tom heard himself say.</p><p>Gayle smiled at him. &quot;I knew you'd say that.&quot;</p><p>Placing her gloved hands on his chest, she threw a leg over his<br>  waist and straddled him. Leaning back, she grabbed his erection<br>  and held it as if she were going to lower herself on him. Instead,<br>  his cock met resistance on her panties as she settled her weight<br>  down on him, pinning his cock between them.</p><p>My god, Tom thought, I've been here less than a minute and I<br>  already want to come just by having her dry hump me. He could feel<br>  the heat of her pussy through the thin silk, the underside of his<br>  cock resting in the groove of her labia.</p><p>Gayle leaned forward until they were nose to nose, looking into<br>  each other's eyes. She smiled at Tom and he swallowed hard. Then<br>  she tilted her head sideways, closed her eyes and kissed him.</p><p>For the first few minutes that all she did, kissing him lightly,<br>  her tongue darting forward occasionally. Whenever he tried to<br>  deepen the kiss she would pull away. Their crotches stayed locked<br>  together during all this.</p><p>Finally, almost involuntarily, Tom began to thrust against her. <br>  Gayle pulled her head back slightly and looked at him with half-<br>  lidded eyes. Her mouth partially open she began to grind back as<br>  she watched him. Finally, she reached under his shoulders and<br>  hugged him deeply. Their mouths met again and this time their<br>  tongues dueled wildly. Both Gayle and Tom made little moaning<br>  noises into each other's mouth as their combined friction dampened<br>  Gayle's panties.</p><p>She pulled away with a gasp. Tom was straining against the<br>  restraints and his cock was poking her cunt through the panties.</p><p>&quot;That was a pretty good warm up&quot; she said as she rolled off of<br>  him. &quot;God this is getting me all hot and bothered.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why did you stop?&quot; asked Tom, afraid he knew the answer.</p><p>&quot;You asked for a hand job, and a hand job is what you're going to<br>  get&quot; she said, suddenly serious.</p><p>Gayle spun around so that she one arm was draped over Tom's waist.<br>  With the other hand she slowly and deliberately wrapped her fingers<br>  around his cock. Holding the skin tightly, she slowly began<br>  stroking him up and down. Tom relaxed his back into the pillow and<br>  concentrated on the wonderful sensations of Gayle's gloved hand<br>  jerking him off.</p><p>Her pace was almost agonizingly slow, but it was also deliberate. <br>  Tom's nearly two weeks of denial, combined with her stroking<br>  started to ramp up to the inevitable orgasm.</p><p>Wanting it to be a good one, Tom tried to relax completely and<br>  just let the orgasm come. He could feel a wave of increasing<br>  pleasure with every stroke, the warm anticipation building up<br>  within him. He was oh so very close now.</p><p>And Gayle stopped and let go of him.</p><p>&quot;Ahh, don't stop now! I was almost there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know - I've been watching your balls. Did you know that the<br>  closer a man is to coming the tighter his scrotum becomes? Right<br>  now, your balls are almost all the way up - I have to give them<br>  time to loosen up again.&quot;</p><p>Gayle pushed herself up and turned around to look at Tom. &quot;You<br>  know, all of this playing with you is just getting me wet, but I<br>  don't think I'll be able to come by stroking your cock.&quot;</p><p>She sat up. &quot;I know - I can get myself off . You don't mind do<br>  you&quot;? Without waiting for an answer, Gayle walked over to her<br>  bedside table and opened a drawer. Tom strained to look, but could<br>  only see a mass of wires. Finally, Gayle took out a small egg<br>  vibrator.</p><p>She pulled her panties off and kicked them aside. Kneeling back<br>  onto the bed she straddled Tom's chest. Tom had an unobstructed<br>  view of her pussy. Her trimmed bush was dewy with her juice. </p><p>&quot;I like this toy. It backs quite a punch for such a small<br>  package, and it's oh so very versatile&quot;, said Gayle, looking down<br>  at Tom.</p><p>She turned the vibe on and Tom could hear the whine of a powerful<br>  motor. She held it just below her left nipple, causing it to shake<br>  the chain she was wearing rather than directing it against herself.<br>  After a moment she switched to the other side. Tom was amazed to<br>  see her nips getting even more erect. His mouth watered at the<br>  thought of sucking on them.</p><p>Gayle now moved the vibe down to her belly, just below the corset<br>  she was wearing. She touched the egg to her skin at the top of her<br>  pubic mound, then started to move it farther down still. Tom<br>  didn't blink once, intent on soaking in every last detail of this<br>  show.</p><p>At last, Gayle held the egg against her clit and a soft moan<br>  escaped from her lips. Tom saw the muscles in her belly contract<br>  involuntarily as she did so. She didn't hold it there long enough<br>  to come, at least not yet. Instead she moved the vibe to her vagina<br>  and slowly inserted it. after a small amount of resistance, it<br>  popped in. She then pulled it out. She watched Tom, his eyes<br>  focused on her cunt, as she slowly worked the egg in and out of her<br>  pussy.</p><p>After a few minutes the egg, as well as most of her crotch, was<br>  slippery with lubricant. Now the egg returned to her clit, where<br>  she slowly worked it around, trying to find just the right angle. <br>  Her eyes drooped closed, she leaned back and finally just held the<br>  vibrating egg firmly against her clit.</p><p>Though clenched teeth, Gayle finally moaned &quot;Oh... God&quot; and<br>  started to come. Tom watched her pussy clench and the muscles in<br>  her belly quiver. She ground her crotch down onto Tom's chest as<br>  she cried out. Finally, she pulled the vibe away from her clit and<br>  fell sideways onto the bed.</p><p>Gayle pulled her legs up to her chest and hugged them as she laid <br>  there. After a few minutes she uncurled and looked up at Tom. <br>&quot;Well, let's see if you're a little more relaxed now&quot;, she said as<br>  she looked his cock over. &quot;I don't know, your balls aren't quite so<br>  tight, but your cock seems to have gotten harder... and there's an<br>  awful lot of pre come on your belly. I'd say you enjoyed my<br>  little show just now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you kidding - I've never seen anything that hot before in my<br>  life&quot;, said Tom.</p><p>&quot;Flatterer - we'll see if I can do better before the morning is<br>  out&quot;, she said.</p><p>Gayle once again returned to the bedside table and opened her<br>  drawer full of toys. She fumbled around inside it for a moment.</p><p>&quot;There we go, everything a man needs to have the hand job of a<br>  lifetime.&quot; She held - something - against her chest, but would not<br>  let Tom see it. Walking around to the foot of the bed she squatted<br>  down and placed it on the floor. She then took her opera gloves<br>  off and wrapped her toys in them and placed them on the bed between<br>  his knees. Tom craned his neck, trying to see what it was.</p><p>&quot;You know, I'm still pretty horny - one orgasm is definitely not<br>  going to be enough for me today.&quot; Gayle again kneeled on the bed.<br>&quot;But I really should get back to stroking your hard cock. I've got<br>  it - I'll put you to work too&quot;. She kneeled over his head, then<br>  slowly splayed her legs until she was laying on the top of his<br>  chest with her pussy against Tom's chin. Without having to be<br>  told, Tom immediately started to eat her out.</p><p>&quot;Mmm. Good boy&quot;, she said, smiling as Tom polished her labia with<br>  his tongue.</p><p>If there was one thing that Tom enjoyed, it was going down on a<br>  woman. He just wished his arms weren't restrained - he wanted to<br>  wrap them around Gayle's thighs. Instead he concentrated on using<br>  his mouth to please her. He worked his tongue all over her vulva<br>  from top to bottom, stopping occasionally to concentrate on her<br>  clit. He took it between his lips and sucked gently on the little<br>  bead.</p><p>&quot;Oh, fuck, I had no idea you were so good at that&quot; gasped Gayle. <br>  She was splayed over him, concentrating on the wonderful jolts of<br>  pleasure that Tom was giving her. She could feel the orgasm<br>  building deep within her and her hips started to roll unconsciously.</p><p>Through half-lidded eyes, Gayle stared down at Tom's cock - she<br>  hadn't so much as touched it since he started, but it seemed almost<br>  bigger. It was steel hard and the head was a fierce purple. It<br>  flexed as she watched and a large drop of pre come oozed out. Tom<br>  was on the verge of coming, just from eating her. That thought was<br>  all she needed to careen her over the edge.</p><p>&quot;Oh my god - I'm coming&quot; she cried as she ground her pussy into<br>  Tom's face.</p><p>Tom continued the stimulation, Her sucked on her clit and flicked<br>  his tongue against it, hummingbird fast. He could feel the muscles<br>  in her belly vibrating from the contractions of her climax. He was<br>  determined not to stop until she pulled away and when her orgasms<br>  subsided she did.</p><p>For a few minutes she just laid there on top of him, her pussy<br>  just out of reach. She was panting from the exertion of her<br>  orgasms and a fine gleam of sweat covered her body.</p><p>&quot;Oh my&quot;, she said eventually, &quot;Why is it you don't have a<br>  girlfriend?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think it might have something to do with being too shy to ask<br>  women out&quot;, he said.</p><p>&quot;Well if it's any consolation, you'll have no trouble keeping them<br>  around once they've sampled your tongue&quot;. She rolled off his<br>  chest, turned around and looked him in the eye. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she<br>  said and with that she gave him a quick kiss, her tongue darting<br>  out once to flick his.</p><p>&quot;Now where was I? Oh yes, I was jerking you off.&quot;</p><p>Gayle reached past his cock to her stash of unknown items and<br>  grabbed a small bottle of clear fluid. She squeezed a dollop of it<br>  into her palm and closed it. She was looking into his eyes as she<br>  reached down with her now lubed up hand as she slowly curled her<br>  fingers around his cock. He closed his eyes and sighed with<br>  pleasure.</p><p>With agonizing slowness Gayle slid her hand up and down his shaft.<br>  She took care to avoid the head for now. Having seen the look on<br>  his face, she now turned her full attention (and both hands) to<br>  pleasuring him.</p><p>Her left arm was draped across him, the hand snaked around to play<br>  with his balls. Her right hand continued its slow journey up and<br>  down his shaft. Tom closed his eyes and just let the sensations<br>  engulf him. Every stroke brought him a little closer. It wasn't as<br>  fast as he'd have liked, but he knew the pace would bring him off<br>  if she kept at it for just a little longer.</p><p>Her grip tightened on every upstroke, and he could feel her<br>  forcing a new bead of pre come out of the head each time. It<br>  dripped down onto her hand, adding to the lubrication. Every now<br>  and then she would stroke just high enough for his glans to get<br>  some stimulation and that always brought an extra jolt of pleasure.<br>  Finally he was there, right on the edge.</p><p>Again she stopped, but this time he could feel her pressing her<br>  other hand between his cock and balls, forcing his balls down and<br>  away. Immediately, his urge to climax went away. He still wanted<br>  to come, but now found that he couldn't.</p><p>Gayle shifted the grip to underneath his balls. Now she pushed up<br>  and away, trying to hold his cock and balls with one hand, by the<br>  base. Tom's scrotum was stretched tightly over his nuts and the<br>  pressure was on the edge between taut and painful.</p><p>&quot;Gahh! What are you doing?!?&quot; he exclaimed.</p><p>&quot;Almost finished, just hold on a bit longer&quot; Gayle replied.</p><p>Tom felt some kind of rubber ring being placed against him, taking<br>  the place of Gayle's firm grip. With a snap she let go, but he was<br>  still held firmly by the ring.</p><p>&quot;This&quot;, said Gayle, &quot;is a cock ring. It'll keep you nice and hard<br>  and, at the same time, keep you from coming too soon.&quot;</p><p>Gayle sat up and put some more lube into her hand. This time she<br>  warmed it up by rubbing both her palms together.</p><p>&quot;Now I get to give you a two-fisted hand job without worrying<br>  about you shooting off.&quot;</p><p>Gayle repositioned herself so that she ws sitting cross-legged<br>  between Tom's restrained legs. She formed her two hands into a<br>  tunnel and began to stroke him again. These strokes were different<br>  from before - Tom wasn't used to two hands at once, and not from<br>  this angle. The pleasure was still intense, but the cock ring did<br>  its job well.</p><p>&quot;You want a lot more than my hands don't you&quot; whispered Gayle, &quot;I<br>  bet you wish you were sliding into a nice tight pussy.&quot;</p><p>As she said that, She tightened her grip and engulfed the head of<br>  his cock as well as his shaft, forcing him to penetrate her well-<br>  lubricated fist. Tom gasped with the shock of this pleasure. He<br>  strained against his bonds, willing himself to come, but the ring<br>  thwarted him.</p><p>Gayle slowed down and leaned forward. Now she stroked him with<br>  just the first finger and thumb of her right hand, shaped into an<br>  OK sign. Her mouth was an inch away from the head of his cock and<br>  she breathed heavily on it as she said &quot;Or maybe you'd like to come<br>  in my mouth&quot;. She leaned back up and giggled. &quot;God this is fun -<br>  are you having fun? You sure feel like you're having fun.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think I might die if you don't let me come&quot;, said Tom.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I think you can go a little longer&quot;, she said. With that,<br>  she started stroking him again. Almost immediately he was at that<br>  point where he needed to come, but couldn't. In his desperation,<br>  Tom had a revelation - Gayle wasn't going to leave him high and<br>  dry, he didn't need to try and come, it would get there in its own<br>  time.</p><p>So Tom tried not to think about it. Instead he just concentrated<br>  on the wonderful sensations produced by Gayle's slick hands on his<br>  hard cock.</p><p>She worked him with her hands. She would alternate her hands going<br>  down over his shaft, so that it felt like he was sinking into an<br>  endless vagina. She would switch directions and &quot;milk&quot; his cock -<br>  a constant stream of pre come was leaking from his cock by now and<br>  Gayle didn't have to re-lubricate her palms - Tom was doing it for<br>  her.</p><p>Each stroke was its own jolt of pleasure and Tom just relaxed and<br>  let it happen. And each jolt pushed his threshold up a notch until<br>  he thought he had died and gone to heaven.</p><p>Sometimes she would jerk him lightning fast, with her fist barely<br>  touching his cock. Other times she would grip him tightly and work<br>  it up and down slowly. Then she circled her palm around the head,<br>  and just under the head. These sensations were so intense that Tom<br>  bucked and tried to keep Gayle from doing it, which of course only<br>  served to encourage her.</p><p>&quot;Do you like that?&quot; She teased as she slowly pressed her slick<br>  palm along the head of his cock.</p><p>&quot;It's too intense - I can't take it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh poor Tom,&quot; she said as the circular rub continued, &quot;It's not<br>  like you have a choice&quot;.</p><p>The excruciating pleasure continued as Tom turned his head and bit<br>  down on the pillow. Gayle had one hand around the lower half of<br>  his shaft, giving him firm half strokes at the base. Her other<br>  hand continued it's slow slick rotation.</p><p>Tom was whimpering through the pillow he had clenched between his<br>  teeth. This was it - He was going to finally come, cock ring or no<br>  cock ring, He cold feel the come boiling in his balls. And just as<br>  he was on the brink of orgasm, Gayle stopped completely, his steel<br>  hard cock was quivering in the air with nothing touching it but a<br>  fine sheen of lube and pre come.</p><p>&quot;Noooo&quot; he cried, &quot;I was right there&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I know, I was worried I might have misjudged. Don't worry baby,<br>  We're on the home stretch now.&quot;</p><p>The threat of Tom's orgasm was now safely over. Gayle grabbed his<br>  cock and pulled it downwards with one hand while she gently gently<br>  stretched the cock ring off of him. His balls were tender, and<br>  they retreated tightly back into his body. Her warm hand gently<br>  cupped them.</p><p>Gayle got up from between his legs and laid down beside Tom.<br>  Laying on her side, she propped her head up with her hand and<br>  looked deeply into Tom's eyes.</p><p>&quot;Are you ready for the grand finale?&quot; she asked.</p><p>&quot;Oh god, anything you want.&quot; he replied, never looking away for an<br>  instant.</p><p>She leaned in closer. &quot;I think you really like being tied up<br>  don't you?&quot; She kissed him instead of waiting for his answer.</p><p>At first the kiss was shallow, but Gayle shifted position so that<br>  they fit together better and she started a frantic deep, french<br>  kiss. Tom was in heaven, necking with his beautiful friend. So<br>  much so that for a moment he forgot about his cock, but only for a<br>  moment - Gayle reached down and slowly wrapped her fingers around it.</p><p>She slowly slid her fist up and down the lower half of his shaft. <br>  With every stroke it got a tiny bit faster, her fist a tiny bit<br>  tighter and she slid closer to the head.</p><p>Tom again didn't try to come, he just rode the wave as he again<br>  experienced the ever increasing jolts of pleasure. This time, she<br>  wasn't watching him - she was kissing him, deeply.</p><p>Finally he was right on the brink of orgasm, he whimpered into his<br>  mouth and that told her all she needed to know. She paused,<br>  briefly, then her fist, lightning fast now, rode over the whole<br>  length of his cock. Tom exploded with pleasure like he had never<br>  imagined - he had no idea an orgasm could be this intense and he<br>  screamed into Gayle's open mouth as he came. She kept up the<br>  stroking, allowing him to ride out each explosive contraction to<br>  its maximum pleasure. Her hand and his chest now soaked with his<br>  come. Finally, she stopped stroking when he was well and truly<br>  spent. She left her hand on his now shrinking cock.</p><p>After a minute, Tom opened his eyes to see her looking at him from<br>  inches away. &quot;Hi&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Hi yourself&quot; she said smiling.</p><p>They lay there for a few minutes as Tom caught his breath. The<br>  exchanged small kisses for a time. Finally, Gayle got up and<br>  unbuckled the leather cuffs that had held Tom into place. Tom sat<br>  up and rubbed his wrists and ankles.</p><p>&quot;So, did you like that?&quot; she asked him.</p><p>&quot;You know I did&quot;, said Tom, gesturing to the splattered semen on<br>  his chest.</p><p>&quot;No, I mean did you like being tied up and at my mercy? Did you<br>  like being teased for over an hour like that?&quot;</p><p>Tom thought for a moment about the experience he had just had -<br>  about the two weeks with no release and the incredible things she<br>  had just done to him. Mostly he thought about how he had finally<br>  reached a point of total trust and submitted himself to her will.</p><p>He looked her deep in the eyes and said &quot;Yes&quot;. After a moment he<br>  added, &quot;I don't think I could take it very often, but I did like it<br>  - and I'd do it again.&quot;</p><p>Gayle smiled and hugged him. Then, joking to show that the<br>  serious confessional moment had passed she said &quot;You're lucky my<br>  arm was getting tired, or you'd have been tied up for a lot longer.<br>  Hurry up and get dressed, I think we both deserve a big breakfast.&quot;</p><p>It was later, after breakfast, when Gayle had to leave to fetch<br>  her son, that it came time for Tom to go home.</p><p>They stood at the threshold of her front door, again hugging and<br>  sharing kisses, both unwilling for the day to end.</p><p>&quot;My ex has Dylan in two weeks. Want to come over and help me...<br>  paint?&quot; she said, giving him a sly smile and running a hand down<br>  his chest.</p><p>&quot;You bet,&quot; said Tom enthusiastically.</p><p>&quot;Can you do something for me in the mean time?&quot; she asked.</p><p>&quot;Anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No orgasms.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What's in it for me?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;Next time I won't use my hands.&quot; she said.</p><p>Tom knew it was going to be a difficult wait. He also knew it<br>  would be worth every moment.</p><p>The End.</p></body></html>
