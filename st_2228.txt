                            Journey to Sxtlan

                          by Vivian Darkbloom

Synapse Hex

   Ceridwyn, on the other hand, was more the romantic type. She let
   fall open her outer mantle, an antique burgandy-laced white
   shirt-coat of glossy oriental sheen, to reveal glimpses of frilly
   translucent undergarments beneath.

   She began with a kiss, a kiss so pure that only a ten-year-old
   could have been the source. A kiss of sweetness and innocence
   beyond remembering, ageless immune to forgetting, which once
   forgotten, could be remembered like the sweet brightly colored
   petals of spring as they pushed way their delicate determination
   through the icy grey encrustation of snow.

   Her tongue and lips, tasting of sickly-sweet sugar candy, luring
   out with gentle soft caress the gentle caring spirit within my
   soul. One kiss, and I immediately felt such tenderness for this
   young innocent, as I read in her eyes dreamy visions of a cozy
   cottage in the forest, chopped wood neatly stacked, and a kettle
   on to boil for tea. Already I was living in wedded bliss of an
   impossibly unreachable past, a perfection of marriage forged in
   an old world which never truly existed except in wobbling false-
   memories of the aged.

   I took her hand, sticky from soda or a sucker recently ingested.
   She giggled at my squirming from the yucky glop all over her.

   "Gummy worms," she offered, dangling a limp colorful tendril.
   "Want one?"

   "No," I replied.

   "'K." She jammed it into her mouth, to join its friends.

   Holding hands now, we enjoyed together a second kiss, this one
   with added bits of chewy saccharine interspersed. The grubby
   little-girl smell melted into the most luscious and enticing of
   aromas, as her soft and gentle caresses made me nearly forget my
   own tiny drop of white stickiness now dripping from her nearby
   naked friend's vagina.

   Oh, Ceridwyn, it is alas but you and only you for whom I had been
   waiting all of my tender years! Just a minor slip astray, and not
   one of my own device, at any rate! One or two slips, I suppose.
   But now here I was back on the right and pure path, from the way
   of the wayward to the straight and narrow road to everlasting
   virtue. The snakes all agreed, bobbing their heads in rhythm with
   the molecules and dancing squiggles.

   Oh Ceridwyn, so pale and frail in the ray of light descending
   from above, haloed curls of red hair backlit heavenlike as she
   smiled so sweetly, my goddess, and there it was, another gentle
   sweet kiss, and now a hint of m&m's in the oversweet candy taste
   that permeated her mouth. My Celtic saint, a virgin so sweet and
   pure. Her overshirt fell open once more as she lay atop my naked
   body, her own slender and slim skin half-concealed by the lace as
   she spread her legs around me while I sank into the softness
   below me, pressed down by her tiny weight, as she thrust her
   little pelvis against my groin.

   The stiffness of my member astonished me, rapidly recovering from
   its exercise of only minutes before, flowing into a rising and
   driving vibrance of stance, a dance of romantic yearning. Oh, my
   Ceridwyn!

   Kalisha sneaked a kiss on Ceridwyn's cheek as the latter thrust
   her tongue deep between my lips, and I felt a hand beneath my
   testicles which could not have been Ceridwyn's, given that both
   of hers were on my two shoulders. Wait, make that one on my
   shoulder and the other fumbling desperately beneath the elastic
   of her little panties, to release the bubble of aching that dwelt
   therein. And when her dainty finger struck its mark, what a cry
   did she give to the grateful breezes!

   Oh, dastardly knave! And the two of them, pretending to such
   innocence, when given to such desires as may only possess the
   very young! The untouched blank page of the unexplored, yearning
   for the stroke of a pen or brush, as she brushed my cheek with
   her lips, innocent lips, hips asunder with immaculate chaste
   burning with the urge to smear itself with the nasty taste of
   sexual skin, to slather with the seed-infested juices of
   procreation!

   The two of them kissed, then, at a light cough from the direction
   in which Sherry was sitting, both looked up apprehensively.

   Sherry waved us on. "Just clearing my throat, my pretties. Your
   efficient application of the skills I have sought to impart
   brings a tear to my eye. Motherly pride, 'tis." Her round titular
   heads hung regally on either side, wall-eyed noses gazing askew.

   With Kalisha assisting, Ceridwyn soon cast asunder her white
   overcoat, revealing thereunder an outfit of lingerie that would
   have been the pride of Victoria's Secret. Kalisha's skin glowed
   with the sexual magic of nudity, her hand inside Ceridwyn's
   panties from behind, wicked movements from her finger eliciting
   sweet sounds of approbation from her friend. The redhead on top
   of me kissed me again, the Manx! With tender romantic charm, with
   the tip of my organ somewhere in the mix, feeling the warm moist
   breath of her lower mouth through the frilly lace of her panties.
   Sensing almost painfully every little twitch of that dainty
   pelvis.

   Oh Ceridwyn! How the sun catches the skin on your cheek from
   behind, shining through the layers its smooth soft pliable
   porcelain purity! A hundred sonnets would I chisel in marble! I
   would, that is, if I knew what a sonnet was, and also if I had a
   chisel, and also if I knew where I could get some marble. I did
   have marbles when I was a kid, also I heard about losing your
   marbles, which must be sort of like the time I lost my car keys,
   except that it was keys instead of marbles.

   "Ow, you're on my hair!" I exclaimed.

   "Sorry."

   Now Kalisha was offering assistance in the form of disrobing
   Ceridwyn of her panties. The frost-white lace leggings remained,
   as did the powdered-sugar see-through frilly top over her ivory
   flat chest, with only the pink lips peeking out from below. Again
   the fumbling desperation as Ceridwyn struggled to work herself
   into position over my robust, miraculously growing shaft. I felt
   Kalisha's delicate fingers guiding, and soon with blessed relief,
   a tip of moisture rocked the desert sands, rocking and moaning,
   ever so gentle but firm and determined as she spread her warm
   ocean wider and wider around me until she had encompassed the
   whole of me in luscious moist fecundity (or proto-fecundity).

   Eyes closed, she had wholly lost awareness of the outer world,
   every sense fully concentrated on that one point of contact that
   we shared. She had me now, inside of her. The two of them had me.
   With devilish grins, they exchanged the unspoken knowledge that
   they owned me now, had captured my hidden secret places, held
   captive within theirs, my private realm thrust into theirs,
   merged in sacred union.

   For it must be sacred, this feeling of love placed inside of us
   by the very creator of life! The nameless, the subtle infinite! A
   feeling indeed designed to make thrive living beings. What warmth
   of coziness, to feel the two ten-year-olds so intent on causing
   my seed to erupt into her, anticipating that special instant with
   eager contentment.

   Oh, Ceridwyn! Would that I could catch in poetry or drawing the
   arch of your eyebrows, the motion and curve as that magical
   moment approached, the genial comraderie between us as the two
   girls exploited every opportunity to caress, to curve, to feel,
   to enjoy, to push my bursting desire higher and higher up the
   scale. To be between such soft tender thighs, and such pale
   gentle loving hands.

   As I felt the swelling of climax nearby, they exchanged delighted
   knowing glances between themselves, and Kalisha lunged to
   forcefully kiss her friend as my thrusts met Ceridwyn's sex-
   center pressing into me with an ever slowing arc of deliberate
   coaxing, until finally that sparkling phenomenon arrived, the
   electric flood of orgasm that pulsed into us both simultaneously,
   as granted drop after drop of precious romance to my sweet lover.

   Collapsing with complete exhaustion, my tongue seeking to
   dislodge a tiny piece of gummy worm stuck between two lower
   molars, I fell into a deep sleep.

   When I awoke, the light had changed. And I had become the subject
   of a deep, soothing six-handed massage. The lotion had a tangy
   pungent herbal odor that stung my nose and made my eyes water. I
   felt it penetrating my skin like menthol, and with it, the colors
   took on deeper saturation in silent sound and emotion.
