Rob sat at the bar with his beer,   Contemplating his fifty plus years,   While Alexis and friends,   With cute faces and ends,   Made him smile, just having them near
They noticed him there, with his suds,   As they tried fending off four young studs   Rob smiled, content,   At the boys' clear intent,   To enjoy the young ladies' fine buds
Alexis drew Rob's worst intentions   With imaginings too dark to mention   He shamefully fought   Both this urge, and the thought   Of defying all age-wise conventions
Rob felt like a wizened old sage   Lusting after a pretty young page   This girl he desired   He might well have sired   Since the lass was at best half his age
Each sat at the bar with a drink   His amber, hers fruity and pink   His age was past fifty   Her tits were, ummm, "thrifty"   But their match wasn't what you would think
A flat chest, the older man knew,   Was no measure what this girl could do,   Her smile and eyes,   Her long, lovely thighs,   Were enough to spin any man's screw
He felt like a lad who'd been smitten   By a vampire slut, he'd been bitten   He must make a pass   At her sweet, heart shaped ass   And then make this girl purr like a kitten
His commanding, strong presence insisted,   With a chaste, coy facade she resisted   But he knew she'd give in   For a night of brash sin   As long as he firmly persisted
She rose from the bar with a smile   Enticed by his calm, mature style   She sashayed away   Such a sexual way   That his cock grew what seemed like a mile
He'd kept his eyes locked on her rear   She'd seduced him with no hint of fear   He'd go where she lead   She glanced back and said   "See something you like, Rob, my dear?"
The girls, with the boys, and the man   Left the bar, with no reason or plan   To go home alone   Or to stiffen a bone   And if so, whom to choose, if they can.
The girls said "The choice does perplex us,"   Not so for the girl named Alexis,   She was tired of bars,   So she eyed all their cars,   Then said, "Fuck, I think I like the Lexus,"
In its fine leather seats she now sat,   With an inward grin, just like that cat   His confident air,   Warm, soft smile, graying hair   Helped her know she liked where she was at
A short while later came kissing   When the young girl found out she'd been missing   The touch of a man   Who was older, but can   relegate younger men to dismissing
His embrace was as strong as a trucker   She thought, "This grayed maestro can pucker!"   His tongue and his lips,   Tore her soul with great rips   She was sure he'd be one awesome fucker
Now her tits, they could use some inflation,   Not a meal, barely even a ration,   Hot lips touched her nipples,   She trembled and rippled,   See, he knew the real treat was sensation
As Rob moved much lower than there,   To arrive at that spot you-know-where,   Between her fine thighs,   Rob choked on his sighs,   When he found her dear kitty was bare.
In Rob's vigorous past girls behaved   Ways that kept men's cocks hard, and enslaved   All ladies, and sluts,   With fine tits, twats and butts,   Yet for all of their charms, none was shaved!
Her legs, he poised ready between,   Where this tasty young morsel was clean,   It gave Rob such joy,   That the minx had played coy,   With no hair, and a glistening sheen
The patience he showed with his tongue,   On pink flesh, so tender and young,   Did draw from the girl,   With each flick and twirl,   The notes of a song fondly sung
While for Rob, to his pleasant surprise,   As he gazed into sweet, young, blue eyes,   The A-A-R-P,   Though a member was he,   Would not hinder her moans and her cries
Yes, up top our Alexis was meager,   Yet the older man still seemed so eager,   When he did what men do   Then Alexis knew, too   That this gentleman's no minor leaguer
The angel before him was yearning,   To be filled with his decades of learning,   His heart filled with sin,   He plunged his cock in,   Where the fires of heaven were burning
Her breasts were magnificent nothings,   In need of attention and loving,   To Rob they felt best,   Hard nips poking his chest,   While her pussy, his hard cock was stuffing
He tried, as he fucked this young cutie,   To make her come first, it's his duty!   But her cunt was so tight,   Such a wet, hot delight,   As he came, he roared "Age before beauty!"
That his cock then stayed hard was amazing,   But her tender, young cunt felt just blazing   He hammered her still   With an elder man's will   'Til her cries at his efforts were praising
While the young girl was writhing, and screaming,   As her pussy was throbbing, and creaming,   This gentleman's skills,   Gave her such wicked thrills,   That young Lexi was sure she was dreaming
His marvelous strokes would not rest,   This insanely fine fuck was the best,   To her shock and surprise,   Her wordless, loud cries,   Turned to words, yelping "Yes, Daddy, Yes!"
"Oooh Daddy, you fuck me so good,"   She purred, like no little girl should,   She loved his firm feel,   She continued to squeal,   As he pleasured her all that he could,
Now those words, this kind man, should have troubled,   Yet throughout her base screams they stayed coupled   His cock never ceased,   He grew more like a beast,   With each "Daddy" his thrusts were redoubled!
Our Alexis was so deeply laid,   Enchanted, spreadeagled, she stayed.   One habit was old   To do as she was told,   So when "Daddy" barked "Come!" she obeyed.
The orgasms burst like a storm   Wracking her lithe, nimble form   With their bodies entwined   Her twisted, fogged mind   Hoped that this was her new lover's norm
While Alexis tried hard to recover,   from the seasoned, skilled strokes of her lover,   She knew her bar game   Never could be the same   It was older men now, and no other!
Rob lay there, exhausted, but grinning   His head, and his heart, both were spinning   He'd followed his cock   But his heart had been rocked   By a girl whose life was just beginning
After both of their bells had been rung,   So tightly to him this girl clung,   They talked in the dark,   In Rob grew a spark,   He felt fatherly, wanted and young
He longed for her touch and her laughter,   He knew once again he must have her,   Her body, her eyes,   Her long slender thighs,   He'd pay any price… only after…
Some nights with new lovers go badly   While others can end rather sadly   But this went so well   That Alexis could tell   For the rest of her life she'd love "Daddy"
