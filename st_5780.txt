*** August 28/29 - Seth

It wasn't just that Seth had nominated his attractive 
secretary as one of the people on his list but in 
hindsight he would have been a lot smarter to be less 
open about his selections.

His wife Julie did NOT! like the idea of him even having 
a list.  She didn't care about what the rest of her in-
laws were planning, Seth was her husband and she was not 
going to share him.

Sitting all day with her sister-in-law Joanna and their 
unfortunate offspring she had worked herself up to a 
quiet rage by the time her husband turned up to take her 
to "their" room.

"Hah!" she thought.  "We have a perfectly good house 
where he could have looked after us.  We didn't need to 
move into this brothel-barn!"

Her husband had seemed pleased with the number of women 
he had dredged up.  "How could he just pick up dozens of 
schoolgirls like some dirty old man?"  And then to go out 
of his way to find his fantasy floozies!

The door was no sooner closed behind them than she 
started.  Tears weren't a tactic she had bothered with in 
the past but then she had never felt this sense of 
betrayal before either; she resisted the emotion-charged 
watering at the edges of her eyes and went on the 
offensive.

"I suppose you're happy.  You've collected your sluts; 
have you got a timetable together yet?  Don't bother 
answering, just take me off of it if you have.  I told 
you before - I won't be a part of any goings on."

Her husband had been through it all the previous evening 
after his brother had phoned.

Seth thought that Len had made a valid observation about 
their immunity and about their prospects for the future.  
He personally thought that the population size might not 
be big enough as it was, and was going to discuss that at 
the meeting planned for the morning; he looked at his 
watch - under seven hours away!

He hadn't gotten much sleep the previous night and had 
had little time to rest that day.

The point Julie seemed to miss was that to get the 
maximum long term benefit they needed as wide a genetic 
base as possible.  Ideally that meant as many men able to 
father infants as well as women but it wouldn't help if 
the children were blind.

They might be able to support a few blind girls who could 
be bred back in the next generation but the only real 
option was for all the men who had resistant genes to 
spread them as far as possible.

This included himself and THAT was what Julie objected 
most strenuously about.

She couldn't see (bad choice of words) that the 
circumstances meant he could no longer remain faithful to 
her.  Her ultimatum, "me or them" didn't sway him in the 
least.

He was prepared to "care for her in sickness or in 
health" and she would have, and still could, remain his 
life partner (and senior wife).  However he liked the 
idea of "them"; he liked it very much and though he 
wished it was going to be "me AND them" he was quite 
willing, after 24 hours of haranguing, to simply go with 
"them".

Maybe Julie would come around after a while; she 
obviously still loved him or she wouldn't make such a 
fuss.

He turned to her and put his hands on her arms.

"I'm sorry but ..."

He got no further.  She shrugged his hands away and 
pushed his chest.  "Get out of here!  I don't want 
anything more to do with you."

She turned, struggling not to cry, and felt the bed 
against her legs.  She collapsed onto it and as Seth 
closed the door behind him he heard the sobs she had been 
holding back.

While he felt some guilt, he also was amazed by the 
weight that was lifted from his shoulders.

He had been dreading the confrontation and it had instead 
been an abrupt dismissal; no pleading, just an expression 
of contempt for what they felt necessary.  It made it 
easier for him to walk away.

He went back to the gym and sat down by the rest of his 
family so he could speak with them without disturbing the 
others.

His daughter Nancy had her own room and his youngest 
Rachel had apparently gone off with his nephew Michael 
for some reason.  That left his eldest daughter Karen and 
his son Graham.

"I'm sorry to impose on you but you know your mother is 
opposed to what we are trying to do, or at least my part 
in it.

She's a bit distressed and my being there only makes her 
worse.  I was wondering if you would try to calm her 
down."

His daughter answered with an immediate barked laugh.  
She and her mother had gone head-to-head on a number of 
occasions since Karen had hit puberty.  She considered 
many of her mother's views to be old-fashioned; Hell, her 
mother's own mother had thought Julie old-fashioned.

She had also tended to be rather tyrannical about 
enforcing her views and Karen had been getting ready to 
move out when the epidemic hit.

She personally thought her father to be a bit sleazy, 
suspecting him of some past indiscretions if not quite 
infidelities, but she had no real proof that he had been 
other than faithful to her mother.

But that in no way meant she would give any succour to 
that woman!

"I'm afraid she will just have to work things out 
herself.  I for one am quite happy to try to make this 
work."

Graham, who had been closer to his mother than his 
father, simply said "I'll go."

He had been sitting there since lunch time, commandeered 
to move mattresses for a brief spell but otherwise 
ignored by his "special" relatives.

He probably should have been grateful to them but he 
resented the fact that, but for a gene or two, he was 
relegated to the status of "invalid relative" rather than 
"Lord of the Universe".

He knew some of his cousins hadn't even been considered 
simply because their parents had been blinded too.  He 
was only here on sufferance because his father was not 
willing to cast his "useless" son aside.  As such he 
despised his cousins, most of whom he considered dickhead 
know-it-alls.

How did they know his children would be blind and theirs 
wouldn't anyway?

He understood how his mother felt and was quite willing 
to be with her and out of this draughty hall.

Seth led Graham up to the rooms he had been allocated and 
left him there after leading him around to "show" him the 
bathroom and the small stock of personal supplies he had 
put in the room.

All the while his wife had maintained a stony silence.  
She refused to acknowledge him unless he came to 
apologise and promise to forget about the other women.

Julie was however disappointed when the door closed 
behind him without a word to her.  She wasn't speaking to 
him right now but that perversely didn't mean she didn't 
want him to talk to her.

Perhaps he wouldn't come back!  She began to quietly sob, 
her body heaving with the effort.

Graham put his arm around her.  "Forget about them all 
Mum.  I'm here and I still love you.  We'll look out for 
each other."

-----

Seth stood in the corridor for a second before deciding 
to search for some-WHERE to sleep.  At this time of night 
he wasn't about to go searching for some-ONE to sleep 
with, though his thoughts did drift towards his top-of-
the-list name, Nicola, his secretary.

Karen's suspicions would have hurt Seth.  Though he DID 
have a roving eye and had on occasion been tempted, he 
had not strayed since first going steady with Julie.

He did however have a vivid imagination and on occasion 
it had gotten him into trouble when he should have been 
concentrating on his wife rather than on a fantasy image.

He found a sheet of paper, wrote his name on it and 
pinned it to the door of an available room.  "It's a pity 
checking into hotels wasn't this easy in the past."

"Tonight I just want to sleep; tomorrow, well, who 
knows."

He closed the door of his new room and it's single bed.

-----

None of Graham's words seemed to help.  The sobs finally 
settled but he could tell she was distressed.

It was late and they both needed to sleep but Julie was 
distraught and couldn't drop off.  That made it 
impossible for her son to sleep too.

Graham wondered what he could do.  Sleeping tablets might 
have helped but there was no chance he could get some.  
He thought about what his father had said earlier and 
realised he had left a couple of bottles of spirits in 
the room.

Graham got up and oriented himself.  The table with the 
box of supplies was at the end of the bed and away from 
the door.  He felt his way and took two tentative steps 
past the safety of the bed before feeling the wall.

Working his way along he bumped into the table and felt 
around.  A bottle, and another.  They felt about right.  
He twisted and the caps came off.  A sniff.  Yes, 
Whiskey.  And the other one was gin.  No more.  Ah.  Some 
cups.

He knew his father preferred the whiskey, his mother the 
gin.  "At least the old fart had been that considerate", 
he muttered to himself.

In lieu of mouthwash he took a swig of whiskey.  It 
wasn't his drink, he preferred beer and at 17 hadn't had 
much of that.  The fiery liquid burned his throat and he 
gasped but the warmth rising from his stomach felt good 
and he took another.

The taste improved as his tongue was numbed by the 
unaccustomed spirits.

In the end he took both bottles and the glasses back to 
the bed.

"Sit up Mum.  Have a drink of this.  It will make you 
feel better."  Graham only hoped he wasn't lying.

He gave her half a glass and it took quite some 
encouragement but she eventually drank it down.

Julie would have preferred a touch of Vermouth and a 
little ice but it wasn't too different from her normal 
martini.  She had tried to emulate James Bond's vodka 
martini but preferred the taste of the Juniper berries; 
she did however normally restrict herself to just one.

Tonight Graham had promised it would help her sleep and 
she wanted to forget about her bastard husband.

Graham wasn't sure she should have had the third though.  
He had swallowed his own large glass in smaller sips and 
his head felt funny.  What must hers feel like?

He decided to have another as well and had just finished 
it when he realised he had a pressure in his bladder that 
wouldn't wait.

He worked his way around the bed until he felt he was 
aligned correctly and once again took two steps forward.

Nothing!  He stretched his arms out wide and touched 
something to his left.  He had gone through the doorway 
and found the wall he had been looking for.

Without thinking he turned the light switch on, then 
sheepishly turned it off again.  He wouldn't need light 
switches again.  He sympathised with his mother as the 
thought depressed him. 

He used the toilet and then thought how nice a shower 
would be.  He stripped off his stale clothes and piled 
them where he wouldn't trip over them.

-----

Finally feeling clean, Graham was ready for sleep and 
hoped his mother had dropped off by now.

He wasn't aware that she had helped herself to a fourth 
considerably larger gin and was definitely over her 
problems, at least for the balance of the night.

Graham, wearing a pair of boxer shorts he normally would 
have consigned to the laundry, found his way back to the 
bed and with some effort actually managed to get his 
mother between the sheets.

He had to take her shoes off and thought she would be 
more comfortable with less clothes on so he unzipped her 
skirt and dragged it over her hips.  He got her blouse 
unbuttoned, thankful for the first time that he couldn't 
see her semi-naked state.

Admittedly, he saw more flesh at the beach but this was 
his mother, for god's sake.

Dragging one sleeve off then the other he managed to roll 
her to one side and then back as he turned down the 
sheets.  The effort had tired him and he decided one more 
swig, well two then, wouldn't hurt - they would probably 
help him to sleep too.

He lay down beside his mother, kissed her forehead and 
said "Goodnight" before the room swam around and he 
passed out.

-----

Julie barely registered the words.  Her brain wasn't 
functioning properly and it could only match the sensory 
inputs against past experience.

Bed; body; "Goodnight"; smell of whiskey.

She rolled over and put her arm over her husband's chest.

"He does love me!"

"Why wouldn't he?"  The question seemed silly and she 
almost forgot it.  "No!  It was important."

It came to her as she mulled over the question.  "Oh!  He 
must have accepted my ultim-mata-ataum."

The concept was there even if the word was beyond the 
current capabilities of her thought processes.

"What a lovely man."

She snuggled closer and reached down to feel his boxers.  
"Hmm!"  He got hard quickly under her touch and stirred a 
little beside her.

Julie drunkenly giggled.  She knew how to reward him.

She slipped under the covers and pulled his hard prick 
through the opening of his shorts.  It angled up towards 
her face and she kissed it before parting her lips and 
sliding her mouth down over her husband's prick.

His hips arched, pushing it deeper.  "He must want this", 
she thought.  "Normally he lies still and lets me suck 
for ages."

Feeling buoyed by the knowledge she could still excite 
her husband, Julie increased her drunken efforts and was 
soon wrapping her tongue all around the throbbing knob.

She lost it a couple of times as she bobbed her head up 
and down but soon had it back in place.

She may have been drunk but she was still aware enough to 
realise he would pop his cork if she continued.

She wanted to have some of the fun too and slid back up 
in the bed.  It only took her seconds to peel off her 
knickers and bra before she clambered over him to sit on 
his cock.  "Oh that is good."

She rocked gently back and forth as she gripped her tits.

"Why couldn't he just accept this and forget about those 
sluts?"  Julie had to stop thinking about it as she began 
to enjoy the feelings spreading through her.

She felt the spurts from Seth's cock buried deep inside 
her, disappointed he hadn't lasted like he normally did.  
It was over too soon and his cock would slide out of her 
as it shrunk, cutting her pleasure short.

It had been nice though and at least he was with her and 
not tomcatting around.  She slid off and was asleep 
before she thought about the cum oozing from her well-
fucked slit.

-----

Graham was parched when he woke and it was fortunate his 
eyes were no longer sensitive to the morning light.  As 
he became aware of his surroundings the uncomfortable 
cold mess in the front of his shorts brought him awake 
suddenly.

"Hell.  I haven't had a wet dream for years and I can't 
even remember what it was about.

He only hoped his mother hadn't been aware of it.

He reached over to wake her and touched bare skin.  It 
took him a moment and then his hand drew back - he had 
patted her tit.

"What happened to her bra?"

"Mom?  Wake up."

"Hmm?  Seth?  Oh, my head."

"No it's Graham."

"Graham?  Where's your father?"

"He found somewhere else to sleep last night."

"He did?  I could have sworn he was here.  Oh!  I have to 
go to the bathroom.  Oops.  Where are my clothes?"

Fortunately her son couldn't see her."

"They should just be beside the bed."

"Who undressed me?"

"I took your blouse and skirt off.  I don't know about 
anything else."

Julie recalled some vague dream.  "Dad Seth return and 
have his way with me?  Surely not with Graham beside me."

Still he must have.  Julie would not even consciously 
consider the alternative.
