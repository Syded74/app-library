Cutters Creek 2 (MF, oral, preg)
By Homer Vargas

	A while back I wrote to tell everyone about things 
in Cutters' Creek.  To really understand what's going 
on, you really ought to read not only "Cutters Creek," 
but Jimmy Davis's yarns about "Fertile Valley," 
because Cutter's Creek is just up the mountain from 
there.  In the first chapter we learned that 
practically all the females from 10 to 70 are either 
have newborns, are pregnant or are about to be.  In 
Chapter 1 Alexi, the Public Health nurse in Cutters 
Creek, told her stuffy friend Cindy, the Welfare 
Department representative, how she let herself get 
knocked up, too, not that she could have done much to 
help it.  She also warned her younger colleague to 
mind her own business.  Let's see what has happened 
since.

*****

Several weeks had passed since Alexi's tension-filled 
conversation with Cindy.  Alexi hoped that her 
headstrong young friend would take her advice to steer 
clear of the Church of the Spirit crowd, but she 
hadn't been able to keep much in touch.

Partly it was work.  The day after her talk with 
Cindy, both of the Meador twins had their triplets on 
the very SAME DAY.  Sally Mae and Ruthie Joe, the 
girls who normally helped Alexi at the clinic, were 
both out that day with morning sickness and Alexi 
wasn't as nimble as she used to be with her own little 
bulge getting bigger by the day.  To say she had her 
hands full was an understatement!

And the delivery was only the beginning of the 
problem.  Soon Alexi had six hungry babies and only 
four milk-filled titties - huge, well-supplied 
titties, but still only four.  Fortunately the twins' 
older sisters had just given birth, too, and they had 
had only one baby each.  A quick call got the two new 
aunts down at the clinic and soon four happy women 
were being sucked by eight happy babies.

The story had a happy ending in another way, too.  The 
near crisis finally convinced the State Health 
Department to send Alexi some help.  She almost jumped 
for joy when she saw the reinforcements that turned up 
the next Monday morning.

Dr. Carlos Gonzalez was a hunk.  Alexi grinned almost 
hungrily as she took in the curly black hair, the 
smooth olive skin and the piercing blue eyes of the 
young doctor.  Actually, Carlos wasn't quite yet a 
doctor.  The Department sent him to Cutters Creek as 
part of his internship.  Although Alexi was happy 
about it, Carlos was not.  He let it be known that he 
would rather be back in the state capital at the 
university teaching hospital doing research.  But he 
had a commitment to the state and had to fill in 
during the emergency.  Carlos also let everyone know 
that Becca, his hot, blonde, society-girl fiancee, 
wasn't too happy about not having her Latin lover to 
keep her satisfied morning and night, either.

Neither of these facts unduly concerned Alexi.  She 
was pretty sure what seeing dozens of pregnant young 
females would do to the young man.  She intended to be 
the one to reap the benefits.  Carlos might not intend 
to be unfaithful to Becca, but Alexi had some ideas 
about how to change his mind.  

By Wednesday afternoon things were quieted down and 
Alexi and Carlos were taking a rare break.  Carlos was 
still in shock about why so many women and girls in 
Cutter's Creek were pregnant.  Trying to be casual, 
Carlos asked Alexi about her own pregnancy.

Alexi grinned.  This was going to be her chance.  "You know 
I'm not married, don't you?  I guess you think that makes 
me a 'bad girl.'"

"Of course not, Alexi.  I see plenty of cases of unwanted 
pregnancy.  Contraception is never 100% certain."

"Would you think differently if I told you it was a twelve 
year old boy who knocked me up?" she grinned.

"Twelve?"

"Yep!  A scrawny kid with a donkey dick.  And while he had 
it in me, there was nothing I wanted more than him to put 
his baby in me."

"You WANTED to let a twelve year old boy make you 
pregnant?" Carlos asked incredulously.

"I'd better tell you the whole story."

[See Chapter 1 for Alexi's story.]

*****

"And that the way I got my belly full of babies," Alexi 
sighed.

"Babies?" Carlos gasped, still trying to absorb Alexi's 
tale.

"Yeah he pumped me so full of jiz it put two in me," Alexi 
patted her pregnant paunch and grinned as Carlos's eyes 
fastened on it, .  She could see what hearing about her 
experience was doing to him and she smiled.  "Did you like 
my story?"

"It - er -- demonstrates a different dimension of the 
phenomenon.  We'll need to go deeper to find out what's 
really going on," Carlos stammered.

"But I mean, you 'enjoyed' hearing how that donkey-horse-
hung boy knocked me up, didn't you?"

"It was ... er, edifying."

"So," she snorted, "your prick was 'edified' hearing how 
that boy got me so horny I let him put a baby in me?"

"Alexi, it's not that at all ..."

"Isn't it?  I saw you get that big hard on when I talked 
about getting a big pregnant belly.  Don't you enjoy 
thinking about getting women pregnant?  I'll bet you're 
looking forward to making your fiancee's tummy swell, 
aren't you?"

"Yes, but ..."  

Carlos couldn't speak both from the arousal he felt and 
some guilt about his conduct with Becca.  Both as her 
fiancee and her gynecologist, he hadn't been totally 
ethical.  Child bearing was very important to Carlos.  He 
had ten little brothers and sisters.  He could hardly 
remember his mother NOT having a big belly.  Carlos wanted 
a houseful of kids, himself.  He was concerned that Becca 
would not be able to have children; several female 
relatives of hers had not.  Besides, he figured her father 
couldn't object to their getting married if he knew his 
daughter was pregnant.  Therefore, without her knowing it, 
he had switched Becca's contraceptives for fertility pills.  
If he were back home, he would be waiting for the rabbit to 
die.

"And what about afterwards?"  Alexi's amused voice brought 
him back from is reverie  "Once you've got your sweetie's 
belly huge and pregnant, do you intend to keep fucking 
her?"

"Of course.  The orgasms are very good for both mother and 
baby." Carlos replied, happy to be clinical and have a 
moment to think, not that it did him much good.

"Would you prescribe the same treatment for me?" Alexi 
grinned and rubbed her belly.

"Alexi, don't ..."

"Don't what, Carlos?  Don't pull up my smock and show you 
how smooth and tight my baby filled belly is already?  
Don't show you how wet and pouty my pussy is?  Surely you 
know that pregnancy makes some women really horny, don't 
you?

"Er, yes."

"Ever eaten the dripping pussy of a horny woman with a 
bulging belly?"

"Er, ... no," he admitted.

By now Alexi was standing in front of the gaping galen.  
Slowly she lifted higher the hem of her ridiculously short 
maternity dress.  "But if you had the opportunity to get 
your mouth on the juicy cunt of a knocked-up woman, you'd 
take it, right?" she said, sticking her belly in his face.  
The aroma of her overheated twat hit him like opening an 
oven.  He fought it for as many nanoseconds as he could, 
then plunged his face into her moist muff.

It didn't take Carlos long to have Alexi screaming in one 
orgasm after another.  His skill at pleasuring Becca with 
his mouth was one of the reasons she had chosen Carlos over 
many richer suitors.  But -- surprise, surprise -- soon 
neither Alexi or Carlos were satisfied with eating and 
getting eaten.  "I've got to get fucked, you wonderful 
cuntlicker. I want you cock in my pregnant pussy."

"Alexi??" he pleaded.

Without saying a word, she bent over and offered him her 
ass.

That was too much.  Carlos lunged for her, but Alexi broke 
for the examination room.  In moments she had clambered 
onto the low table and dropped to her elbows.  "Woof, 
woof!" she grinned back at him, raising her ass in the air.  
God what a sexy bitch though Carlos as he bunched her 
maternity smock above the now noticeable bulge in her 
tummy.  "Babies love it when Mommy cums," she cooed.  "Make 
my baby happy, Carlos.  Make Mommy happy!  Make Mommy come 
with that beautiful cock of yours!" she cried, quite 
unnecessarily now, as Carlos had her firmly by the hips and 
was pounding her vigorously.  

"Yes, baby!  Fuck me.  Oh, shit, I need it!  Fuckkkk 
meeeeieieieiei!" she screamed over the excited man's 
grunts, coming hard as Carlos unloaded enough spunk in the 
rutting woman to impregnate fifty fertile nurses.  His 
pecker didn't know she'd already been done and continued 
pumping jism into her hot pleasure hole.  Not that Alexi 
minded.  She loved it and loved knowing she'd be getting a 
lot more of this from now on.

*****

A few days later Alexi called Cindy to ask if she could 
bring Carlos along to the next Health/Welfare inter-
departmental meeting.  Cindy seemed rather distracted, but 
agreed to the usual time at her office.  Alexi and Carlos's 
arrival together was not a coincidence; they had spent the 
afternoon together.  Yeah, doing exactly what you are 
thinking.  Since she had seduced him that first week, Alexi 
spent every night and as many odd hours as possible with 
Carlos's prick in her.

Alexi was shocked at the change she saw at Cindy's office.  
The gray walls had been redone in pinks and blues.  Gone 
were annual reports of the Welfare Department and the 
pamphlets on how to get a job.  In their place were 
magazines and books about pregnancy and childbearing.  

As she and Carlos waited, Alexi began idly thumbing through 
"Single Mother."  To her surprise, the magazine did not 
deal with the financial and emotional problems of bringing 
up a child alone.  Rather, it was dedicated to advising 
single women how to get pregnant even if their boyfriends 
did not want to father a child.  It even included a 
humorous story by Homer Vargas, one of Alexi's favorite 
internet pornwriters.  "Principles" was about how a woman 
tricks her husband into getting her pregnant time after 
time after time.  She grinned, seeing that pages of near 
nude women with paunches of varying sizes in "Pregnancy 
Today" had given Carlos a hard on.  She suspected that 
dinner might be later than usual that night.

Alexi and Carlos were so engrossed in these strange 
periodicals they hardly heard Cindy waltzed in.  When they 
looked up, Alexi was stunned!  Gone was the slightly 
sourpuss expression she had seen in weeks past.  Cindy was 
radiantly happy.  Her clothing showed it.  Rather than 
faded jeans and baggy sweaters, Cindy had on a cute little 
sundress cut four or five inches above her knee and a 
surprisingly translucent blouse.  Her usual gym shoes had 
given way to smart white pumps.

Alexi and Carlos looked at each other in astonishment.  
"She's not wearing a bra!" Carlos' eyes said to Alexi.

"Hell, she's not even wearing panties!" Alexi's eyes 
replied.

"Well, I guess we can get started," Cindy sighed, "Although 
I can't see what you people are so worried about.  Folks 
around here are just having babies."  Did Alexi hear 
correctly?  Three weeks ago Cindy had been incensed about 
the 'animalistic behavior" of the "savages" here.  Now she 
found noting out of line?

"What do you mean, Cindy"

"I went to see Rev. Daniels and now I understand 
everything," she replied angelically.

"Cindy!  You didn't really go see that man, did you?" Alexi 
asked apprehensively.

"Of course I did.  I said I would and I'm glad I did.  
Jack really straightened something out between us."

Alexi and Carlos exchanged glances but Cindy was 
bubbling over and proceeded with her story.
