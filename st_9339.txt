Kelly's Massage: Part 5: Gagged With Panties (Lower Body)

I call out to Nicole, “Please, lick my clit. I need it! I neeeed it! Fuck!”

Then I feel all sensation stop. She pulls away. Fingers away from my nipples. Tongue away from my labia.

She looks at me.

“Kelly. I’ll tell you what you need.”

“Nicole, please. I just need some deep pressure. I’m going nuts. Please. I need you to lick my clit.”

“Kelly, you don’t understand. I know what you need. You think you need me to lick your clit. But you don’t. I’ll tell you what you need. Now stop talking and let me get back to work.”

Okay. So that was weird. But I close my eyes and immediately feel the warmth of her lubed-up fingers on my nipples and her soft tongue on my labia. It’s beyond what I can take. So teasing. I’ll never get off this way. Fuck. It’s so hot, but it’s driving me nuts.

“Nicole… I’m ready. Lick my clit. Make me orgasm. I’m ready.”

Again, all sensation stops.

Nicole looks at me. Sternly.

“Kelly, you need to relax. I’m in charge here. I know what you need. I’m the one who will be giving the orders. Do you understand.”

“I guess so. I just thought…”

“Don’t think, Kelly. I’ll do the thinking. You just lay there. I’ll tell you what you need.”

“But…”

Her voice is still calm and soothing, but she clearly means business. “Kelly, here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to play a game.”

“A game?”

“That’s right. A game.”

She goes back to polishing my nipples. I retreat into my nipple haze. My eyes roll back. My pelvis reaches out for contact with something… anything.

Nicole continues. “Here’s the game. It’s called ‘Kelly stops talking and if she says one single word she gets my panties stuffed in her mouth and sealed in with duct tape.’ That’s the game." She says it so silky smooth but it rocks me to my core. I’ve never been gagged. Ever. I don’t know if I would like it. But somehow hearing the words sends chills of excitement through my belly, up my spine, and down my thighs and legs. I physically tremble at the thought. Did I somehow relinquish all control? I don’t even remember it happening. But here I am. My arms immobile. Being told to stay completely silent.

I say, “Really?”

“That’s the game. Starting now. No speaking. Not a word. One word, and I take off my panties, stuff them in your mouth, and seal them in with duct tape.”

I don’t dare speak. The clock has started.

“Do you understand the rules?”

I nod.

“Very good. Now I can get back to work.”

Her fingers still circling my nipples, making me crazy, she once again lowers her mouth and tongue. This time to my inner, inner, thigh. Just millimeters from my lips. So incredibly close yet so incredibly far. She starts kissing my thighs there. Fuck. Please. Just move like an inch and a half over. That would do it. I would orgasm in three seconds. I try to shift my pelvis to get it in position, but she just moves away, continuing to kiss me and torment me. Fuck. This is absolutely the torture she was talking about. It must be. I don’t even know how much time has gone by. She’s making me insane.

The kissing and licking continues. Touching everything except what I need. Licking and kissing my asshole. My labia. My inner thighs. Everywhere except where I need it.

I want so bad to say something. Fuck. Anything. All I can do is moan.

The kissing intensifies. She starts sucking my lips. All in her mouth. It feels so amazing but will never make me cum. Fuck I need to cum. I need to orgasm. I fucking need it. I can’t fucking take it anymore. My hips are gyrating, seeking contact, but she keeps dodging what I need. Damn it! Fuck. I can’t do it anymore. Another 10 seconds. I can do it. Ten seconds at a time. Come on, Kelly. Come on. Fuck. The nipples. They’re on fire. So smooth and oily. Her fingers so fucking hot against my tender skin. I’m going to fucking explode. The kissing continues below. The sucking and kissing. Damn it. Damn it! Fuck! Fuck!!!

“FFFUUUUCCCCCKKKKKK!!!!”

Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh shit.

All sensation stops.

It’s quiet. My hips are still gyrating. My nipples feel ghost fingers. My body is on fire still, even in the absence of all contact.

Nicole is quiet. She slowly gets to her feet. Our eyes lock.

“I told you not to speak,” she says. Just looking at my naked body, still quivering in the aftershock of her teasing touch.

“I know. Sorry? Can I have a second chance?” I ask, knowing the answer will be “no.”

“Kelly, I’m sorry. No second chances.”

She doesn’t say a word. She slips her panties off her toned thighs. Her femininity comes into view. Neatly trimmed. It’s very pretty. I find myself oddly attracted to it. I’ve never been attracted to a woman before. These are some strange sensations.

She steps out of her panties.

She holds them up in front of my eyes. She lightly brushes them across my face. Across my nose and mouth.

She leans in.

“Open wide.”

I can’t do it. I close my lips tightly and shake my head.

Then she surprises the hell out of me. I feel her fingers pinching my right nipple. Hard. Fuck. Really hard. I don’t know if it hurts or if it feels good. My nipples are so oversensitized to any touch right now. Fuck. It kind of hurts, but at the same time, I want her to squeeze harder. Both nipples. Fuck. As hard as possible. Just squeeze. But as my mouth opens in surprise, she stuffs her panties in.

“MMMMmmmfffmfmfm.”

“Stay there, Kelly. Don’t move a muscle. I need to get the duct tape. And if you’ve spit those panties out before I get back, well, let’s just say you don’t want to try me.”

I’m swimming in a sea of emotion. I’ve never been dominated like this before. Sure, I’ve had boyfriends who’ve made me strip for them. Or who have tied me up and tickled me. But fuck. Nothing like this. Nothing like this.

My chest is quivering. The butterflies are bigger than ever. Even my legs are shaking with excitement and anticipation.

Do I like this? Do I like being tied tightly and gagged with a woman’s wet panties? Fuck. If you’d asked me an hour ago, I would have said “hell no.” But now? I’m not sure. I’m certainly not signaling that I want it to stop. Do I? No. I don’t. I don’t want it to stop. She owns me. Fuck. This woman own me. I can’t quite admit it, but it’s the truth. And shit. I like being owned. No. I crave it. I need it. SHIT! She was right. She was 100 percent right. This is exactly what I need. Fuck!

Nicole comes back with the duct tape. She smiles at me.

“Hold still, Kelly.”

I hold my breath. The tape comes down. Her panties are sealed into my mouth. Fuck. The taste of them. I taste Nicole. I never liked the taste. I always tried to avoid the aroma. But here it is. But it’s different. It’s special. It’s… no. No way. It’s sexy. It makes me feel sexually alive like I’ve never felt sexually alive before. And I’ve had some good sex. And some amazing sexual experiences. But this? This? This is beyond. I have relinquished my soul. And the scary part is, I think Nicole is just warming up.

She climbs on top of me, straddling my hips with her legs.

“That’s better, Kelly. Much better. I’ll continue kissing you in a moment. Because it’s what you need. I’m going to start with your belly. Your beautiful belly. So tender. So pale. So soft. So sweet. I’ll just kiss it and kiss it and kiss it.”

She starts to caress my belly with her fingertips. No oil this time. Just her soft fingertips on my skin.

I squirm at her touch.

Her panties feel so strange in my mouth. But I just let it go. I give over to it.

Her kisses start. Right below my bellybutton. So smooth. Her lips are so smooth. Her tongue so wet and gentle.

A moment goes by.

She gets right into my face. “You like that, Kelly. Don’t you.”

I hesitate, not wanting to admit it. But then I nod.

She says, “I like you like this.”

“Mmmmfffmffmff?”

“Do you know why I like you like this?”

“Mmmfmfmffffff?”

“Because you are my submissive little pet.”

Her words hit my soul. Shit. This is totally what I needed. For once. Just for once. I need to let go. To not be in control. To just be completely submissive. I can’t even move my upper body. I can’t even speak. All I can do is submit. Shit. It’s fucking incredible.

“Say it, Kelly. Say you love being my submissive little pet.”

“Mmmmmffffmfmffff.”

“That’s nice. That’s what I like to hear. I can see it in your eyes, Kelly. This is exactly what you need. Right? Am I right?”

I nod.

Nicole smiles at me.

Then at once, her face disappears and I feel her kisses, tongue and lips, on my belly. On my chest. On my sides. On my arms. She sucks my fingers. Her mouth is all over my upper body. Teasing my nipples with her tongue. Fuck. Please don’t stop. Never stop.

But then she stops. Her face is in mine.

“Kelly, I’ve kissed every inch of you. Starting at your toes. Remember that? Remember when I was sucking your toes? That feels like a long time ago. You liked that, didn’t you?”

My eyes are wide. I nod slightly.

“And I worked my way up, slowly. Every inch of you I kissed. Every beautiful inch. You are beautiful, Kelly. Inside and out. You are simply beautiful.”

My eyes still wide, I don’t know what to expect.

“But there’s one place I haven’t kissed you.”

“Mmmfffmf?”

“That’s right. On your mouth. I haven’t kissed you on your mouth.”

Fuck. Is that what’s going to happen? Do I want that to happen? I don’t even know. I really don’t. I do and I don’t.

She gets right into my face. She strokes my hair. She is tender. Genuinely tender. Not teasing. Just loving and tender.

“You need to kiss me, Kelly. It’s what you need.”

She’s right. I just can’t admit it. She’s a woman. I’ve never kissed a woman. Not like this!

“Tell me it’s what you need.”

She gently removes the tape. The moisture was so plentiful, the tape comes right off with no pain at all. She pulls the soaked panties from my mouth. My mouth is dry. She reaches over and gives me the straw of a water bottle. I take a sip.

Her lips are less than an inch from mine.

“Kelly. Tell me it’s what you need. That you need to kiss me.”

Fuck. FUCK!

“Nicole…” my voice is dry still from the panties. “Yes. Yes... It’s what I need.”

Hesitation for a moment.

Eyes lock. Deep eyes. So deep.

Lips meet. Slowly at first. Then fully.

Tongues tentatively touch. Then intertwine.

She leans closer.

I give over to it.

No reservations.

Just me and her.

Everything else vanishes.

The rest of the world disappears.

Just Nicole... and me.
