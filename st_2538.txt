>Next thing i know, it's light outside
>Well inside too, there was a patch of sunlight streaming in
across my eyelids
>That doesn't let you go back to bed no matter how sleepy you are
>and i was really sleepy
>So the first thing my sleepy eyesi see is the back of raven's
head, her hair to be precise.
>It's got sunlight all over it, makes it look almost-blonde in
the bright spots.
>Which reminds me
>My pants are still off
>I'm still sticky
>Both of my arms seem to be wrapped around raven in various
difficult-to-untangle ways
>My sleepy mind struggles to remember how this happened
>It doesn't really flood back
>Not like people always say it does
>It was kind of a trickle, and then i almost jumped when i
realized the last bit
>Blondie totally gave me a handjob while i was "Sleeping"
>Mental me kind of does a jump in the air, arm outstretched with
a click of the heels.

>Raven's still asleep
>Blondie's still asleep behind me
>Time to return the favor
>I start planning it all out in my head as i untangle myself from
raven
>I'll turn over, and rub her softly awake.
>But wait
>This is blondie we're talking about

>She'd probably freak the fuck out and that wouldn't go anywhere
good
>Images of blondie screaming and burly firemen running in with
gas-masks to take me away flow freely through my mind.
>Not that those made any sense, but that's what i was thinking
>Ok, ok, we'll wake her up with a kiss first, then see where i
can take that.
>I'm sure if i mention that i was awake she'll let me.
>Perfect

>I finish untangling myself from raven and begin the slow
endeavour of flipping over
>Sun's in my eyes so it takes me a moment to get adjusted
>I look over to where the sleeping blonde-haired princess would
be.
>Nothing
>The bed's empty
>#Unhappyface
>Plan ruined
>I guess i could technically do it to raven too
>But...
>... i'll be honest, at this point and time i wasn't actually
sure she wanted to be romantic with me
>It felt like everything she'd done up to this point had been a
friend frantically trying to hold onto me when i showed interest
in other women.
>As if i would suddenly stop talking to her because i found other
girls or something
>Like she wanted to remain friends, but pulled me into Lewd~ and
Sex~ because i seemed interested and it was a way to keep me.
>This would have been all great and fine if i was any other kind
of guy
>But to me it felt like i was forcing her, or she was forcing
herself just to not lose me.
>Not a good feel
>Specially with her past
>There goes my stomach doing bellyflops again
>I can't even bear to look at her when i think of this.
>I quietly roll over towards blondie's side of the bed and get
up.

>As i finally slide from out of the covers i realize i've only
got my boxers on, and those are around my knees
>My pants lost somewhere in the sheets
>Can't afford to go back
>Have to leave them behind
>I salute the brave soldiers, served me well they did.
>I check the clock

>7:00 AM
>Fuck it's early

>Might as well just go eat something i guess.
>I pull up the boxers and tiptoe out of that side of the house as
to not-wake anyone

>The Hallway is quiet
>It seems like the rain has stopped, i'm not sure if the power is
back on or not
>I check the living room on my way past
>Glasses is half-in-half-out of her sleeping bag
>Which is impressive considering i quite clearly remember zipping
it up
>Her glasses are like halfway across the room though
>I had placed them all folded up next to her, but whatever she
did had flung them across the room
>I move around the couch to pick them up and put them on a table,
probably in the kitchen where they won't get stepped on.

>That's when i realize homely has completely kicked off the
blanket and is lying half-naked on her side.

>That would easily be enough to give me an instant boner, her
breasts fully exposed, as well as her long smooth stomach all the
way down to her navel.
>Don't forget her panties, light-pink and firmly wedged into her
crotch, before we return to long shapely thighs and long legs.
>This would usually be plenty enough
>But there was more

>Her hand was wrapped around her back and around her behind, one
finger nestled peacefully between her legs.
>And the panties were a dark-shade of pink where that finger was
resting.

>Wet dream maybe?
>Whatever the female version of a wet dream is maybe?
>I'm sure she would have loved the treatment blondie missed out
on
>But i wasn't going to be the one to give it to her.
>The thought of covering her up so the other girls didn't see and
laugh came to mind
>Then i took that thought
>And into the trash it went
>No sympathy
>Fuck homely
>I sure wanted to be there when she woke up to a group of
giggling girls
>It would be priceless
>But my thoughts are interrupted like-they-so-often-are by other
thoughts
>Mostly of the smell that was wafting through the house

>Only one place something that smelled that delicious could be
coming from
>The bathroom

>[spoiler] no silly, the kitchen[/spoiler]
>Smelled god-damn delicious it did
>Baking Cinnamon

>Sugary smells
>Like i woke up in a confectioners bakery

>Time to sneak in and find out what the rock is cooking
>Tiptoes activated
>Menacing
hands-out-infront-and-pointed-downward-weirdly-activated
>Mind you i'm in boxers, not wearing a shirt and i have bandages
wrapped around my wrists that are half-falling off
>I manage to sneak into the kitchen without the gang and the
pesky dog finding where i am.
>Blondie's baking up a storm in here

>The counter is a mess of different cookery cutlery, there's a
couple pans out and some white powder covering lots of surfaces
>She's got these two mismatched oven-mitts

>Not to mention she's got her bunny-pajama shirt back on
>and she managed to find an apron SOMEWHERE that's tied with a
little bow in the back
>Fuck i don't even understand why women wear aprons when they
cook things
>It's like they just can see themselves being cute from a third
person view and do cute things while they do it.
>She doesn't seem to see me right away, so i watch her as she's
humming some tune, swishing her hips and doing various
delicious-related things.
>Yes, in multiple ways anons
>I end up watching her for a minute or two, just admiring the
cuteness
>In retrospect it probably wasn't nearly as cute as i'm saying it
was, but i thought she was adorable.
>I decide to reveal myself as she's bent over fumbling with the
oven
>I hear the clang of the tray as she picks it up and turns around
to look at me with a pan of something undoubtedly delicious in
hand.
>Her face converts from a look of concentration to a beaming
sparkling smile instantly
>"Storybro!" -My first name of course
>She rushes forward to hug me
>Pan in hand
>My life flashes before my eyes.

>I can see my childhood, places i'd never remembered being until
now
>Smiling mothers
>Smiling friends
>Sunlight in the garden at my old house
>The butterflies that always seemed to love my light-blonde hair.

>[spoiler]Butterflies like the ultraviolet color that reflects
off it, i only found that out later[/spoiler]
>Running through every memory
>Meeting everyone i'd known
>My best friend
>That was it
>I open my eyes just in time to see blondie with both her arms up
in the air

>One mismatched kitten-shaped-oven mitt with another square green
one
>This is the last thing i'll ever see.
>I close my eyes in pain as her arms wrap around me
>wait a second

>I saw both her hands
>I open my eyes again and just see blondie's hair in my face
>Kinda shake it loose as i'm standing there with my hands
awkwardly to my sides
>She had set the pan down on the counter behind her
>All i can feel is the warm spots where the oven mitts had
obviously been holding it, on my back
>I'm not dead
>Not dying
>It doesn't even hurt
>It hits me like a sack of bricks
>That fell off a three story building under construction
>due to gross mismanagement of resources and hiring of unskilled
employees.
>Aliens had abducted and replaced Blondie.

>The hug isn't long, but it's long enough for me to formulate an
anti-alien plan
>Wherever they're holding her, there's probably a mothership
>Some kind of teleportation device down here in the house that
lets this alien come and go as it pleases.
>I'll just have to get the fake-blondie to give me context clues
as to where it is.
>Therefore i'm just standing there dumbly as she backs away with
a smile on
>She doesn't even seem to find anything wrong, just turns around
and grabs the pan
>"French Toast with baked-candied apples!"
>She seems to be talking to me
>I can barely make out her alien-language over the alien sounds
she's making
>The pitch at the end of the sentence almost turns into a squeal,
some kind of xenomorph form of communication most likely.

>I've got to call backup, they tell me they're hours away.
>I'm in the pipe five by five.
>landed on an alien planet alone, i've got to fend for myself.

>"It's the best i could come up with what i could find... you
don't think birthday will mind?"

>None of those squeals this time, it's a serious question
>I have to answer as to not seem suspicious
>"No, i'm sure she won't mind." You dirty alien bastard
>"Smells delicious!" Is what i'm going to say when i roast you
with a flamethrower
>I try to make it sound convincing

>I've got to find clues as to where the teleporter is
>The alien asks me for some "Powdered Sugar"
>I have no clue what that's a code word for, but i assume the
cabinets could be where the teleporter is.
>I start rummaging around until i find a box
>"Powdered confectioner's sugar"
>I hand her this alien substance and she spreads it all over the
french toast
>Some ritualistic tribal preparation i guess
>Maybe she was fattening us up to eat us
>As i lean over to hand her the sugar i take a peek in the pan
>Sliced apples sizzling away a caramelized brown in one side,
lightly browned toast soaked in eggs, cream and cinnamon on the
other...
>and she was stirring up what seemed to be some kind of homemade
sugar syrup, while lightly sprinkling it all with powdered sugar.
>There's no way aliens could have this mastery over human food

>I comment on it looking absolutely delicious
>This goes down amazingly well, she's beaming even wider
>She points out that it's ready and it's my job to go wake
everyone up
>I give her a ship-sailor salute
>"Aye Aye Captain Blondie"
>She giggles at this
>+1 me points
>But i've got to go wake everyone up
>I trot off to the living room to start on the girls here first.
>trying to decide who to wake up first and how.
>Then i pause
>If i wake up all the girls right now, i can't return the favor
to blondie
>I turn on my heels and return to the kitchen

>She doesn't even see me coming
>I'm across the kitchen and have my arms wrapped around her
>She manages to get out half of a "Hey!"
>Before i turn her around
>Before my lips are on hers
>She's not struggling against me, just surprised
>I get to watch her eyes change
>Every shade between confusion to complacency
>Every shade between sapphire to sky blue.
>She tastes like candied apples, no doubt sampling the wares as
she went along.
>But that's what i was doing.
>I slide my hands under her apron
>Under her pajamas and around the back
>Lower
>My hands are slapped away.
>"It's hot"
>Damn right it is
>"It's going to get cold"
>....
>Oh

>Fine
>I don't have any sappy comebacks that would make her delay food
any longer
>I could have said a thousand and one things here like
>"Can i eat you first"
>Or the tried and true
>"It's better cold"
>But i didn't
>Nope, i just let go of the adorable girl in my arms and trudged
off to wake everyone up
>i was hungry anyway
>Atleast that's what i kept telling myself
>First i'll wake up raven
>I shuffle down the hallway again
>Kinda sad, kinda with a boner.
>i end up standing beside her sleeping
>She's cute, back to her peaceful reverie of dreams
>I could wake this girl up in any way i wanted at all
>she wouldn't complain even if i had her panties around her
ankles.

>But i'm just kinda standing there not knowing what i want to do.
>Remember what i said earlier
>I didn't want her to feel like sex was all i wanted from her,
the only way to make me feel happy
>Even if it did make me happy
>But you know, we had a prior relationship that was built on
actually getting along with one another and enjoying one
another's company
>All that sappy stuff
>I'm really confused as to what i should do
>Confused half almost not boner
>I play the safe card
>I decided i would wake her up with a hug
>I unwrap her slightly from the blankets and pull her up and
press her against me
>Tightly
>that does the trick
>She wakes up squirming until she realizes it's me
>Then i get shoved off
>wha-
>"Bathroom" that one word and she's across the bed and has the
master bath closed
>oh.. ok then
>Guess its a good thing i didn't wake her up *differently*
>I leave and start heading back to the living room

>Alright, next on the list is glasses
>She's easy
>I really can wake her up any way i want
>And she would enjoy it, and not pretend to unlike SOMEONE else.
>But i'm not sure what exactly i could pull off in the living
room with homely sleeping beside us
>I go for as lewd as i can without taking everyone's pants off
>It involves one hand down the front of her pants and the
waistband of her underwear
>and a kiss
>She wakes up to me lewdly fingering her as well as i can
> and the same nose-holding kiss i gave her the morning before.
>Frankly i have no clue what i'm doing
>But her eyes are wide open
>She's tense
>Instead of relaxing she lets out a loud, long muffled moan into
my mouth
>Hot air and carbon dioxide flooding my lungs in surprise
>I snap my hand out of her pants because she was really loud
>And waking up homely like that would be really really bad
>We break the kiss
>She whispers
>"You can't just start and leave me unfinished..."

>Oh man that's a tempting thought
>However
>"Blondie made french toast and baked apples, it's piping hot out
of the oven"
>I say this with a smirk
>She knows she's been beaten
>Her face turns to a scowl, but her eyes are still fiery
>I've awoken something inside her i hope, or guess, or am
pretending to have guessed.
>She mumbles something like "I'll show you piping hot" as she
picks herself up and starts to stand.
>That is before she gets a look at homely
>She lets out a complete giggle, and then clasps her hand over
her head
>Hahaha, you went to bed drunk girl, that shit's gonna hurt
>specially when you laugh
>But she still points towards homely and asks me what i'm going
to do to wake her up.
>That's a good question


>I get up and walk over to homely on the couch
>she's half on her side, lips kind of open and drooling
>The thought of sticking my dick in her mouth comes to mind, but
that's just not what the situation calls for.
>Instead i wipe the sticky and wet finger i had inside glasses
across her lips
>That's more like it.
>Appropriate meanness to homely accomplished, with more giggles
and "oww my head"s from glasses in the background.
>I then ask glasses how i should wake her up
>I get various responses, most of them including cold water, or
mean things
>But she's saying them in a joking tone
>She points out its homely's last day so i might as well treat
her with a *special* wakeup
>I don't like what this is implying


>That's dirty whatever you have planned glasses
>Then i find out it's not that dirty
>She just wants me to kiss her
>I can do that
>That's almost no problem at all
>I walk over and just decide i can get it done with and then go
and wake up birthday
>I lean down
>My lips touch hers
>Suddenly her eyes jolt wide open
>What the fu-
>I'm slapped in the face and i go reeling backwards
>Glasses had grabbed both of homely's tits and squeezed
>Her hands were still there
>Doesn't matter though
>Homely's yelling about me being a pervert
>Until she sees glasses laughing with her hands still on her tits
>And she squeezes them again
>Honk honk motherfucker

>Homely gasps an "oww" and reaches up and slaps her too
>It's my turn to laugh
>Blondie seems to have heard some of the yelling in here and
announces through the doorway that the food will get cold if we
don't hurry.
>I can't stop laughing
>But i manage to get up and walk over to the hallway again
>Birthday's turn for a wakeup
>This'll be good

>Well, until i get to the door
>Its still locked
>I bang on it
>She's still asleep
>I bang on it some more
>More
>More
>She doesn't seem to be waking up
>I yell her name
>She responds
>"I'm not coming out till homely leaves"
>Oh, right she totally got her ass handed to her
>I try to reason with her, even offering piping hot breakfast for
her.
>Nope
>Won't budge
>Stubborn as shit, that's birthday for ya
>I tell her i'm eating her portion of delicious blondie based
cooking
>She mumbles through the door something but i'm already half gone

>To the kitchen we go
>Off to see the wizard of baked goods
>I arrive at mostly the same time glasses and homely get there,
raven is already helping herself to a plate of deliciousness
>"Birthday has a hangover, we should save her a plate"
>It's the only excuse i can think of to keep the notion of her
still being mad at homely from interrupting this delicious feast.
>Nothing like a rivalry to ruin food
>It seems to work though, homely announces "Yeah tell me about
it" and clasps the back of her hand up to her forehead in a
dramatic fashion
>Her chest sways in a dramatic fashion too

>Crisis averted for the time being i guess
>Well maybe not
>"Are we having a topless party now?"
>It's glasses mentioning the fact that more than half of the
people in here aren't wearing clothes at all up top.

>Homely makes some complaint about them hurting and being sore
now because they were squeezed
>Eyebrows raised from around the kitchen
>Blondie and Raven glaring daggers at me now

>Blondie
>All eyes set on her
>Fair is fair after all
>She realizes what we're all looking at her for
>"Absolutely NOT!"
>That's really more of an embarrassed no, rather than a strict no
>Homely seems to get the same impression and shouts "I'LL HOLD
HER DOWN"
>Oh whoah hold on
>This is a little too fast gu-
>The other girls are encroaching on blondie in the corner of the
kitchen now
>She's flashing her blue eyes back and forth between faces like a
trapped animal
>No we are not doing this to blondie
>again...
>"STOP"
>i'm loud, surprise myself actually
>The gates hold, the barbarians halting their assault.
>I squeeze into the circle and turn around to face everyone
>I'm calm, authoritative
>"Relax, she'll let me."

>I don't even turn around to confirm this, i just figure it's
happening so i might as well make it less traumatic.
>She was working all morning in the kitchen
>When a man she had recently killed
>Called her up from near where she was working
>So she looked out the window at him
>He had the same obsequious manner
>That was the reason she had him killed.
>But he couldn't calm her nerves
>So he sang her this song
>To her, across the home.
>Turn around, Turn around
>There's a thing there that can be found.
>Turn around, Turn around
>It's a human Skull on the ground.
>Human Skull, On the ground
>"Turn around"

>So she did
>I wrapped my arms around her as if to give her a backwards hug
>I asked her one question
>"Do you trust me?"
>I get one response
>"No"
>hahahahaha
>I start laughing into her shoulder
>I find this amazingly funny
>She doesn't seem to though
>She's stiff as a board

>I try to be the gentleman
>I whisper softly in her ear a way out
>"If you don't want to do this, just squeeze my wrist and i'll
stop and make up an excuse"
>I don't think any of the other girls heard me
>I'm not even looking at them though
>I slip my hands under the apron

>I decide i'll start at the bottom button of her pajamas
>With my hands it's like a bajillion million trillion times
easier to unbutton each one
>Bottom button undone
>I slide my hands up further
>Second button undone
>The bottom of her shirt is loose now, flapping open.
>I take my left hand and place it on her bare stomach flat
palmed, as i use the other to continue up the buttons.
>Third button
>I move my left hand upwards slightly
>She jumps
>Her hand is on my wrist

>But it's soft, no squeeze
>I wait a moment for her to make a decision
>Nothing
>I whisper to her again "Squeeze and i'll stop"
>Her hand hasn't moved
>Fourth button
>Fifth button
>Sixth button
>No squeezes
>Her shirt is completely open now, just loosely hanging on her
shoulders.
>I can look over her shoulder down her apron and see her bra
>Oh right she has one of those
>I slide my right hand around and up her back
>I meet my Arch Nemesis on the field of battle.
>Velcro
>fuck i need two hands for this

>Nope not gonna do it
>Not gonna take my hand off her stomach, it would mean she
couldn't squeeze and stop me.
>Plus her stomach is warm and feels nice
>The band is too stretchy for me to just pull one end and have it
come undone, the strap is on the bottom and folded over anyway.
>[spoiler]It's like that so it doesn't rub against your skin and
irritate you ; YW non-bra wearing anons[/spoiler]
>Wait a second
>Clever plan initiated
>I pull my head away from blondie's shoulder
>I crouch down, both hands still in the same place
>I softly grasp the other half of the strap in my teeth through
her shirt, and keep a firm grip while i pull the other side
>The satisfying sound of velcro can be heard throughout the room
>I let go with my teeth
>Still no squeeze on my wrist, but she did give a gasp when she
felt my teeth against her back.
>I turn my head to look at the other girls
>They're all frozen staring
>I try to explain
>"Velcro"
>As if that explained anything

>I return to blondie,
>she's fully undressed now
>Well not really, apron, shirt and bra are still on
>They just aren't all tied on anymore
>Sides the apron
>But i have my hand in a great place on her stomach
>It comes to mind i can move it lower
>She'll stop me if she wants me to stop
>So i bring it lower
>My pinkie is touching the waistband of her brown shorts
>Her hand is on mine
>No squeezes
>I bet i'm home free
>I slide it into the waistband
>She squeezes
>Damn

>Oh well
>That's the limit i guess
>I don't take it personal, i've made great strides for humanity
today
>I just bring my hand off her stomach and around to the sides of
her shirt
>It takes a bit of wiggling but eventually i get it off without
taking off the apron
>Really isn't that bad, just bring her arms back and slide it
off.
>Next up is the bra
>I know how i want to take this off
>I put both my hands on her stomach
>Then i slide them up and under each cup
>Delicious breast in each hand
>I don't really squeeze them, i give her a full backwards pull
with them
>Pressing her back against me
>Her breathing isn't shallow, it's smooth, but fast
>She's rather sensitive i remember
>i don't keep contact for too long
>I move my hands away until the bra is forward, then i move it
upwards and force her arms outstretched in front of her to slide
it off that way.
>[spoiler]It comes to mind i didn't really have to explain that,
i could have just told you i took it off[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]But i guess your imaginations might miss out on the
glorious amount of side and topboob shots i was sneaking the
entire time[/spoiler]
