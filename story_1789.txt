<b><font size=+2>26</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>It was finally time for the two girls to go back home.
Apart from a visit to the Presidential Palace to receive the country's
highest decoration for bravery, which the genial and delighted old gentleman
was unable to pin to their still unadorned chests,&nbsp; and a few phone
calls to the British High Commission, they had spent the entire time in
their hotel suite, recuperating from their ordeal and getting to know each
other again after such a long time apart.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>A doctor had come to the hotel to examine Harriet and
pronounced her in absolurely splendid health except for hair and body lice
which soon yielded to treatment.&nbsp; Gwendoline, he also declared to
be none the worse for her ordeal.&nbsp; Calls to the High Comission had
not succeeded in finding Mr.&nbsp; Bernard James, of whom the official
spoken to denied all knowledge.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>They had refused to appear at a press conference.&nbsp;
Harriet and Gwen both agreed to a request from Katie to let her newspaper
have an exclusive story and interview after their return to London.&nbsp;
A large cheque had been promised.&nbsp; Gwen wanted Harriet to have all
the money, but Harry had insisted they share it equally.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>They had a couple of hours to wait before the official
limousine collected them to take them to the airport, and were lying naked
together on the bed, engaging in one final act of love before getting dressed
and going down to the foyer.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+2></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You serious when you say my father really wants me
to go and see him, Gwen?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Oh, Yes! After we got the news that you were dead,
and I was well enough to get up again, I went straight to see him and your
mother.&nbsp; He was heartbroken.&nbsp; Your mother, alas, is too confused
nowadays to know much, Harry, but maybe that was a blessing in disguise
for her."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Poor old Mummy!&nbsp; She always was a scatter-brain,
even before Alzheimers struck,&nbsp; but at least she used to know what
planet she was on - some of the time!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>They continued to fondle each other for a few minutes.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I suppose you'll off to Oxford in a few weeks, my
love" said Gwen, drawing back from a lingering kiss.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"What, Gwen!&nbsp; I'm not to be your slave after all?&nbsp;
What a disappointment!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"That was just a silly fantasy of mine!&nbsp; As if
that kind of thing could go on nowadays!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harriet replaced her tongue in Gwen's mouth and kept
it there a long time, moving it about and hungrily massaging Gwen's.&nbsp;
Finally she withdrew.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I can't spend three years running around with a bunch
of sillly little kids, Gwen!&nbsp; It's too late for that.&nbsp; I'm a
very experienced young woman by now!&nbsp; Please let me come and work
for you!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"But, Harry" said Gwendoline, "You'll be a heroine
to all the other undergraduates.&nbsp; A big fish in a small pond!&nbsp;
And you always were the one who wanted to do well and show the world what
women are capable of.&nbsp; Be sensible, darling!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I have already shown the world that a woman can do,
only in my own way!&nbsp; I have the dubious distinction of having developed
a physique many guys would die for, and all I want now is the chance to
keep it in shape and even better it.&nbsp; And you have a splendid library
at your place, so my mind won't lose out altogether!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Well, Harriet.&nbsp; I cannot deny that I would love
to have you around, but only as a friend and lover - not a slave!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harriet returned to her frenzied kissing for a while.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"If you love me, Gwendoline, then you will let me be
your slave.&nbsp; I&nbsp; want to be yours for ever.&nbsp; I mean to say,
Gwen - I went out to Africa because I was upset that you had married and
I would be 'de trop'.&nbsp; I knew it was a cruel mistake when I kissed
you goodbye at the airport.&nbsp; You were so brave, but I knew how much
pain you were feeling.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"And then I went and got myself kidnapped and you came
out and got me free.&nbsp; I can't possibly survive without you to look
after me!&nbsp;&nbsp; So please be my mistress - it's all I want!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"What about Bernard?&nbsp; What if he asked you to
marry him?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"He won't.&nbsp; I knew that somehow when we said godbye
at the rebel base.&nbsp; I daresay he'll come around to screw me from time&nbsp;
to time, always with your permission, of course,&nbsp; but marriage for
him would be too confining."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>.....................................................................................................................................................................</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Get undressed, Harry!&nbsp; I've something incredibly
important to tell you!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The two were walking to board the aircraft.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"What?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I own fifty per cent of the shares in this airline!&nbsp;
I got a message yesterday from&nbsp; my London office, confirming the deal!
Isn't that a lovely last-minute surprise!&nbsp;&nbsp; We go home nude -
how lovely.&nbsp; A perfect ending to our African Odyssey!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>To Gwendoline's delight, the steward was the self-same
young man who had looked after her and Jessica on the outward journey.&nbsp;
This young gentleman could scarcely believe his good fortune as he attended
to the needs of two naked ladies.&nbsp; He was particularly amazed by Harriet.&nbsp;
Never in his life had he seen a woman who was so lovely and incredibly
strong at the same time.&nbsp; He fussed around the pair, who were the
only occupants of the first class accommodation - the other first class
passengers had been imperiously downgraded by Gwen, who had sweetly promised
them a handsome recompense.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"When do you want me to start work, Mistress Gwendoline?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Whenever you like, darling.&nbsp; And don't ever call
me mistress again.&nbsp; Get it out of that empty head of yours that you
are my slave!&nbsp; You are my darling friend - the most beloved person
in my life - bar none!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Yes, Mistress!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You fucking idiot!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
