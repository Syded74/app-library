Kelly's Request
by TheBlushingPrincess 

Part 1

Kelly and Brent had dated for about six months. They had an amicable breakup about a year ago. They are still very good friends. For the past couple of months, Kelly has been dating Brent’s roommate and best friend, Mike.

Brent gets a text from Kelly to meet him at the coffee shop. They are sitting at a secluded table. The coffee shop is not busy. Mid-morning.

BRENT: Hey. So what’s up? What did you want to see me about?

KELLY: It’s about Mike.

BRENT: Oh no. What’s wrong? Is everything okay? You guys aren’t breaking up, are you?

KELLY: No, no. Nothing like that.

BRENT: Okay. So what is it?

Kelly gets shy and stalls.

BRENT: I know that look. What’s going on?

KELLY: (very shy) I was fantasizing about you.

BRENT: (horrified) What??? Kelly! You can’t do that! And don’t tell me that! Why would you tell me that?

KELLY: Okay, well wait. It’s not like you think. I wasn’t really fantasizing about you. I was fantasizing about what you would do to me.

BRENT: What I would do to you?

KELLY: Yeah. You know...

BRENT: I’m afraid I don’t.

KELLY: (super shy and quiet.) You know. In the bedroom?

BRENT: Look, yeah, we had fun in the bedroom. But you’re going to have to help me out. What do you mean?

KELLY: Like… when you would… you know… tie me up and tickle me?

BRENT: (a deep sigh; more than a bit uncomfortable talking about this) Yeah, what about it?

KELLY: (shy, quiet, and leaning in) I was fantasizing about that.

BRENT: Shit, Kelly. We’re not dating anymore. You’re dating Mike. My best friend!

KELLY: I know. But wait. And also about when you would… you know… make me be naked for you?

BRENT: (shocked at what he is hearing; he speaks in a firm but comforting tone) Listen, Kelly. You can’t think of me like that anymore. Okay? It's not... it's not appropriate.

KELLY: But you’re not getting it. I’m not fantasizing about you. I’m fantasizing about those things you did to me. And how it made me feel.

BRENT: But you hated those things. I mean, that’s why I just did them a couple of times. You really seemed to hate them. So I didn’t do them anymore.

KELLY: What do you mean? You just did them a couple of times? I don't think so.

BRENT: (leaning in and whispering so nobody will hear): Okay. Like that first time I tied you up and tickled you. I thought you would like it. But you absolutely hated it. I tried it again one more time, and you just screamed and begged me to stop. So I did. And that was that.

KELLY: Well, I remember it differently.

BRENT: (confused) Are you saying you liked it?

Kelly just stares back at him.

BRENT: Well shit, Kelly. If you liked it, you should have said so. I would have tied you up and tickled you every single day.

Kelly likes the sound of that. She blushes and gets tingly down below.

KELLY: You would have?

BRENT: Sure. I mean, I loved doing that to you. You were so cute and squirmy. Naked and screaming. I could have done it forever. But you really didn’t seem to like it.

KELLY: Maybe I didn’t at the time. I don’t know. But looking back on it, I think about it and it totally turns me on. I wish you had just kept going.

BRENT: Well, if I had known you liked it, you have no idea the kinds of things I could have done to you.

Kelly is suddenly very excited. She leaps forward in her seat.

KELLY: Tell me! What else would you have done to me?

BRENT: Kelly! No! We can’t talk about that stuff anymore. First of all, we’re not dating. And second of all, you are dating MIKE!!! My best friend!!!

Kelly is disappointed, but not willing to give up.

KELLY: Just give me a little clue. A little taste of what you would have done with me... to me.

BRENT: Come on, Kelly. Really?

She just stares back at him.

BRENT: Okay. Well, I totally would have had you naked all the time. Me dressed and you naked. Making dinner, watching television, whatever. When we were in the apartment, you would have been naked. No questions asked.

Kelly likes what she hears. She squirms in her seat. Brent is very uncomfortable with the situation.

KELLY: What else?

BRENT: Oh, I mean all kinds of bondage. All kinds. I would have tied you up every which way. Standing, sitting, on your knees, on the bed, to a chair, in the shower. Ankles behind your head. Face up, face down. You name it. Sex toys in the front. Sex toys in the back. I mean, the works.

Kelly’s heart is racing.

KELLY: And what else?

Brent can’t believe what he is seeing and hearing. Kelly was just this sweet, prudish girl. Never wanting anything but the most romantic and purest of physical contact. Did she really have this crazy submissive side that he didn’t know about?

BRENT: Well, I mean, the tickling.

Kelly is on fire at the mere mention of the word “tickling.”

KELLY: What about it! What about the tickling! Tell me!!!

BRENT: Well, remember when I found that spot on your inner thigh? (Kelly smiles a kinky, squirmy smile.) I thought you were going to blow a gasket. I could have stayed there forever. But you screamed and used your safe word.

KELLY: (Disappointed) I know. (She leans in and whispers.) I was fantasizing about it this morning before I got out of bed... but there was no safe word. (She leans back, smugly puts her hands behind her head, and smiles a guilty smile.)

BRENT: Okay. I think that’s enough of this conversation. I just can’t believe you liked that stuff and never told me. That’s something else. But look, Kelly. I don’t want you thinking about me like that.

KELLY: But I told you. I’m not thinking about you. I’m just thinking about those things being done to me.

BRENT: Well, have you talked to Mike about it? Maybe he could do that to you.

KELLY: I tried. I asked him to tie me up and tickle me.

BRENT: And?

KELLY: He didn’t know what he was doing. He was just kind of poking at my body. I giggled to put up a good show, but honestly, it just kind of pinched and hurt a little.

BRENT: What about having him make you get naked?

KELLY: No way. He wouldn’t even know where to start.

BRENT: What about the nipple thing?

KELLY: Okay, yeah. I did. I told him to play with my nipples.

BRENT: Okay. Well there you go!

KELLY: He did it for like a minute and then started to go down on me.

BRENT: Most women would not complain about that.

KELLY: I know. And I’m not complaining. I love it. And he’s sweet. And good at it too. Very giving and generous. But you know me and my nipples.

BRENT: Yes. I do, Kelly. I do know you and your nipples.

Kelly perks up again, excited about reliving the memory.

KELLY: (excited) Tell me about them!

BRENT: What?

KELLY: Tell me about my nipples! Tell me everything!

BRENT: (He is not going to tell her about her nipples.) Kelly.

KELLY: I mean, remember that time when you tied me to the couch in front of you, and you played with my nipples through that whole movie?!? I mean, shit. You tormented me for like an hour and a half, just caressing my nipples the whole damn time. I was begging for you to touch me. I was going insane. But you were relentless. You just kept watching that movie and killing me with nipple torture.

BRENT: Yeah. That was fun. Watching you writhe and beg? I did enjoy that. (Catching himself get caught up in the memory. He snaps out of it.) So tell him! Tell him to do that to you.

KELLY: He wouldn’t know what to do. After three minutes, he’d see me squirming and he’d feel bad for me. He would untie me and snuggle.

BRENT: But that’s sweet.

KELLY: I know. And I like that. I do. But I also like the other stuff. (A pause while she thinks of the right words.) He doesn’t know how to be mean.

BRENT: Hey! Are you saying I was mean?

KELLY: Oh, come on. You know what I’m talking about.

BRENT: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Of course.

Silence for a bit.

Kelly gets a wild look in her eyes.

BRENT: Oh, shit. There’s that other look I know.

KELLY: I have an idea.

BRENT: I’m nervous.

KELLY: Fair enough. But hear me out.

BRENT: For you, my friend, I will hear you out. But I make no promises.

Kelly gets a little shy, but she is determined to power through it and say what she is thinking.

KELLY: What if…

BRENT: (nervously) What if what?

KELLY: What if you tell Mike you’re planning to be out all night, and he and I have the apartment to ourselves.

BRENT: You got it. Easy. Done.

KELLY: But wait. You tell Mike you’re out all night. Maybe even sleeping somewhere else. Visiting a friend for the weekend. Whatever. And at some point in the evening, I convince Mike to tie me up.

BRENT: Will he do that?

KELLY: He will. He has no idea what to do with me once I’m tied up, but yeah. He’ll tie me up and go down on me or something. It’s not wild, but it’s nice.

BRENT: Okay. You got it. You can count on me.

KELLY: Hold on! There’s more.

BRENT: I was afraid of that.

KELLY: But in reality, you’re not out for the evening. Turns out that your plans were cancelled. So you get home earlier than expected. And you walk in and see that Mike has me tied naked to the couch.

BRENT: I’m not sure I’m comfortable with this.

KELLY: Okay. Just hold on. Here’s the good part.

BRENT: That's not the good part?

KELLY: No. Not yet. So you walk over to Mike and stand there and look at me all naked…

BRENT: Totally not comfortable with this…

KELLY: (ignoring him) …and you say something like, “Hey, Mike. Need any ideas for what to do to Kelly?”

BRENT: (Flatly) There is no way I’m doing that.

KELLY: (pleading) PLEEEEEASE? You’ve got to help me. I NEEEEEEEEEEEEED to be dominated.

BRENT: (truly in shock) Kelly! I cannot believe the words that I’m hearing coming out of your mouth! Dominated???

KELLY: Yes! Like you would do to me!

BRENT: But you hated it! That’s why I stopped doing it!

KELLY: Okay. First, I guess I didn’t really hate it. I just didn’t realize it at the time. And second, you stopped doing it? My recollection is that you did it plenty.

BRENT: Well, I guess if I had known that you craved it, I would have done it a lot more.

KELLY: Brent, please. Please help me. I love Mike so much. He’s so wonderful. But I need that part of my sexuality. I neeeeeeeeeed it!

BRENT: Where did all of this come from?

KELLY: I was talking to Sophia and Felicity the other day...

BRENT: Oh, shit. Well, that’ll do it. Felicity is nuts. And Sophia? She’s like a walking sexual time bomb.

KELLY: So please. Will you help me? Pleeease???

Brent looks down and rubs his forehead. Is it a headache coming on or just the full weight of Kelly’s insanity?

BRENT: (resigned to his fate) Okay, Kelly. You win. I’ll do it.

KELLY: Oh, hooray!!!

BRENT: But listen. If there’s the slightest sign of objection from Mike, or if I get the sense he is uncomfortable with any aspect of it, I’m walking. Agreed?

KELLY: Hmmmmmm…

BRENT: (Insistent) Agreed???

KELLY: (reluctantly, but this is the best deal she will get) Okay. Agreed.

They shake hands.

KELLY: (just wanting to make sure): And you’re going to teach Mike to give me the full treatment, right?

BRENT: The full treatment?

KELLY: (squirming as she speaks; it's all she can do to not touch herself right there at the coffee shop) The stripping and the tying up and the tickling and the feet and the nipples and the edging…

BRENT: Shit, Kelly. You are fucking insane. You have got to stay clear of Felicity and Sophia. They are a bad influence on my sweet Kelly. But yes. I will do my best.

Kelly smiles the purest and sweetest of smiles. She is so happy.

Brent sighs. What has he agreed to?
