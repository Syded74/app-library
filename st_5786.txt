Cilla, Sonia and I had got together at a cast party 
following my school's annual theatrical production.  We 
had arranged to go to a movie following an amorous three-
way encounter at Sonia's house and they had told me of 
their further adventures as we travelled by train into 
the city.

*********************************************

From the station we passed a block of offices to reach 
the shopping precinct.  Although we hadn't discussed 
which movie to see yet, I had looked through the paper 
that morning and saw that there were a range of session 
times throughout the afternoon for each of the several 
movies which looked likely choices.  Thus there was no 
hurry for us to get to a cinema.

I generously acquiesced when the girls asked to look in a 
few clothes shops along the way; I didn't mind and it was 
an opportunity to learn about their preferences.

The breezed through the first store - a couple of items 
had caught their eyes but the price tags stopped them 
even thinking about trying them on.

At the second they did pop into the change rooms while I 
stood by a watchful assistant.  It was years before 
Wynona but times were not really any different; a small 
shop keeper had to keep a close eye on the stock in order 
to make a profit.

I was not offended but it also meant that I couldn't get 
into the change room either.

Cilla had picked a bright yellow bikini and was modelling 
it for me.  She stood in some apprehension as I made my 
appraisal.

My eyes ran from top to bottom and back up again and I 
swear I saw her nipples crinkle with delight when I 
smiled.

Her breasts were gathered together which emphasised the 
valley between; her belly button, an "innie", then led to 
a slight mound covered by a yellow triangle that showed a 
slight camel toe as she stood with her legs slightly 
apart.

I had never really thought about the odd way we draw 
people until then.  Once you graduated from stick figures 
to putting some more realistic flesh on the arms and 
legs, a woman still seemed to be drawn with the top of 
one leg meeting the top of the other.  Looking at Cilla 
it was obvious that the drawings should include a small 
horizontal area there instead and I started hardening as 
I thought of what that area contained.

I twirled my fingers in a circular motion and she obliged 
by turning around to show her curvaceous ass.  With a 
brief smile back over her shoulder she returned to the 
cubicle.

Sonia had come out in the meantime in a red bikini.  It 
too looked fabulous.

On a larger woman, an A cup was nearly invisible; on a 
medium one it became noticeable but on Sonia's slight 
frame her breasts were a delight to behold and only 
needed the narrow strip of fabric provided rather than 
the cups in Cilla's suit.  The narrow design meant the 
curves of her breasts were visible above and below the 
suit.

She span for me as well and I gave her a quiet clap of 
approval.  The bottoms were cut high on her thighs with 
little covering her tight cheeks.  Although her frame was 
slight she had an obvious butt and this was now on 
display.

Noticing that the shop keeper was busy elsewhere, she 
winked and showed me an extra feature of the swim suit.

She raised her hand and pointed to the clasp separating 
her breasts.  When she had my attention (had she ever 
lost it?) she pressed the centre and the two sides of the 
bra fell apart, the slight cups hanging down from the 
straps.

Sonia dropped her hands with a "Ta-Da" motion and poked 
her tongue out cheekily before disappearing behind a 
curtain.

A minute or so later, Cilla was back.  She had on a plain 
red-brown skirt that fell to the middle of her shins.  It 
had a row of buttons to one side up the front.  Leaving 
her midriff bare, she wore a light cotton halter top 
which tied off across under her breasts.  With no bra, 
her breasts were free to move and move they did as she 
swished the skirt from side to side.

Have you ever watched a metronome or a long rally at the 
tennis?

Cilla moved her leg through the opening in the skirt 
which had been left unbuttoned for most of its length.  
Her milky thigh was visible almost to her underwear.

She straightened and untied the knot in her top.  The 
edge hung free from the curve of her breasts showing the 
ease of access to those delightful playthings.

Cilla again returned to change and I waited to see 
Sonia's next outfit.  She took a bit longer but it was 
worth the wait.

She had on a pair of dark red slacks that were anything 
but.  As she turned and leaned over to display her butt I 
could tell immediately that she had no panties on.  There 
was no way that the panty-line could have been missed 
considering how tight the material was wrapped around her 
buns.  I mean, each cheek was separately wrapped and the 
material was tucked up into the crack of her ass.  If 
there had been the slightest dimple present it would have 
been clearly visible.

She turned back and unzipped the matching jacket to show 
a fine white blouse.  Although I could make out the 
colour of her skin through it I didn't realise exactly 
how sheer it was until she removed the jacket and clearly 
displayed her firm breasts and rigid nipples.  (She 
confided later she had stroked them through the light 
fabric before coming out.)

I blew her a kiss and she disappeared again.  What a 
wonderful pair (of girls, of course.  Although ...)

Cilla came out first and asked me what I thought.  I gave 
her a passionate kiss and said "Simply superb."

She took the items over to the counter and waited for 
Sonia.

I gave Sonia a kiss too when she appeared which made the 
assistant stare back and forth between the three of us.

"You looked smashing", I told Sonia.

Sonia turned to put the clothes back onto the rack when 
we called her back.

"What's up?  Don't you want them?"

"Yeah.  It was fun to show off and I'd like to keep them 
but I can't afford them now."

"Don't worry", said Cilla.  "Let this one be my treat."

She gave Sonia a hug and taking the clothes from her, 
gave them to the lady at the counter.

The assistant took her payment and made up two parcels 
which were duly handed to me as their "bearer".

We left the store and walked on for a while before 
entering a department store where Cilla whispered in 
Sonia's ear.  Sonia nodded and they joined arms and set 
off together for the escalators, assuming their "loyal 
companion" would follow.  As if I would fail to follow 
two such cute little asses whereever they may lead.

We got off in Women's Fashions - big surprise - but they 
then led me to the lingerie area.  While they had ridden 
the escalator Sonia had apparently confided to Cilla that 
she needed something special to wear under her new slacks 
and they led me through a range of interesting garments 
to the panties section where they proceeded to sort 
through the wide range of G-strings.

They examined and discarded several styles until they 
found one with the flattest straps.  Having made their 
decision as to style they had to choose an appropriate 
colour but decided to get rid of me first before I got to 
see what purchases they actually made.  I might have 
known what was in their "packages" but they weren't going 
to let me see the "wrapping paper" until they decided it 
was time for me to unwrap them!

"Scoot off somewhere else for a while.  We'll see you at 
the bottom of the escalators in about 30 minutes."

Cilla gave me a quick kiss to soothe the dismissal and I 
gave Sonia a similar peck goodbye as I left them to their 
secrets.

As I wandered around looking for the book section I 
passed a jewellery counter and noticed various selections 
of rings and pendants.  The green emeralds would look 
nice against Cilla's red hair while the blood red rubies 
would suit Sonia.  How much were they?

I had been working part time for my father's firm for the 
past couple of years (he believed in my learning the 
business from the ground up and I had enough interest to 
see it as a worthwhile career) and had a reasonable 
balance in my bank account.

I had been saving to buy a car (another big surprise for 
a teenage boy) but fortunately my mother's only aunt had 
decided she was getting too old to stay alone on her farm 
and had come to live in a "granny flat" that had 
originally been a games room and change room for the 
swimming pool.

Her husband had driven a '54 Dodge Plymouth before he 
died and since then it had only been driven by my father 
during our frequent visits.

She had had no children and so it turned out that, with 
less than 10,000 miles on the clock, it was given to me 
as an early 17th birthday present.  This gift meant that 
I had ample funds to spare so I thought a nice piece of 
jewellery for each of my new girlfriends may help to show 
my feelings towards them.

I was comparing items and checking the prices when I 
noticed a curious ring.  It was multicoloured and the 
metals twisted through each other and back again.

"Excuse me.  Could I have a closer look at that ring 
please?"  I pointed out the pad to the assistant and she 
removed it from the display case.

"Which one are you interested in, sir?"

I pointed to the ring in question.

"Ah, yes.  18 caret gold combined with red gold and 
platinum.  It gives a lovely effect, doesn't it?"

I examined the ring.  The metals had been plaited 
together and then joined seamlessly back on themselves.  
I thought that the Fates must indeed be looking 
favourably upon us.

This was perfect.  I looked at the price tag.  Yes, I 
could afford it.

"It's what I am looking for but how do I know what size 
to buy?"

The lady gave me a piece of cardboard with a number of 
large circular holes punched in it.

"Find the smallest hole that comfortably slips over the 
persons knuckle; the letter below that hole indicates the 
ring size.  If you want this ring in a size we don't have 
we will have to order it from the supplier since it isn't 
possible to adjust the size of this ring easily."

"How long would that take", I asked.

"No more than three working days - maybe same day 
delivery if your order was in first thing."

I thanked her and, slipping the ring gauge into my back 
pocket, wandered back to the meeting place.  I had about 
seven minutes to wait and decided I had time for a little 
necessary shopping of my own.  I left the store and 
walked past a couple of others to a pharmacy where I 
eventually found a selection of condoms.

I had made the effort over the last year or so to make 
sure I had the technical knowledge of both sexual 
technique and contraceptive practice.  Until now I had 
not had an opportunity to apply or develop that knowledge 
in a practical sense.  I had not had a chance to discuss 
contraception with the girls yet but felt that I had a 
responsibility to ensure we had at least this much 
protection.

Book learning can be useful in some fields, and good old 
common sense and, to some degree I suppose, instinct can 
help in unexpected situations but nothing beats having a 
chance to try things over until you get them right.

I at least was somewhat knowledgeable about the quality 
and brands of condom currently on the market.  Additional 
features such as ribbing, colour or flavour were not as 
important as contraception.  However I still had to front 
up to the lady at the counter in a far from empty store 
to buy prophylactics for the first time.

I had a nightmarish vision of her calling out to the 
pharmacist "How much for the extra large pack of 
condoms?"  Instead she simply took the box (ONLY a 
dozen), checked the price and put it into a small paper 
bag which she sealed with tape.  She took my money and 
gave me my change with a sweet smile.

Still a little embarrassed, I thanked her quietly and 
almost fled from the store.  It did get easier over time 
but it's always the first time you remember best.

I slipped my parcel into one of the fashion bags and 
returned to the specified meeting place.  I was five 
minutes late but no-one was waiting for me so I put the 
parcels down and leaned back to wait.

It was another twenty minutes before they turned up; 
fortunately the warmer weather meant plenty of nice 
things passed by with each minute.

A friendly punch in the arm accompanied by the command, 
"You keep your lustful glances for us in future, buster" 
indicated their arrival with further packages.

The girls took charge of the bags I had and put the 
smaller into the larger before returning them to me to 
carry with an admonition not to peek inside.  They set 
off arm in arm again beckoning me to follow.
