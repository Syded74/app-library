*********************************************************
When I assumed my role as Roger Torrent in order to get 
close to some nasty people who didn't deserve to live I 
knew I would have a foster-sister.

I just didn't appreciate that she would be the 
resourceful, stubborn type who would complicate matters 
when she noticed me creeping across the roof late one 
night as I returned to my room.

It was a discovery that brought us both considerable 
pleasure - and me some grief.

*********************************************************

Breakfast involved us trading a couple of wide-mouthed 
grins as we both remembered (in the non-masturbatory 
sense) the previous evening.

Fortunately there were too many people around in the 
house, in the car, and at school for Anna to kiss me as I 
know she desired.  I know she desired it because I wished 
I could have held her, acknowledged her.  Though the 
situation I was in may cause doubt that it was the case, 
I *WAS* too professional to do something as foolish as 
that - yet.  Once things were well underway it may be 
useful as part of a perfect exit strategy.

Anna and I went our separate ways and those I had seen 
Friday night greeted me warmly.  I was fitting in, even 
with the not-so-heavenly twins Kyra and Mark who, if not 
specifically my targets, were my principal contacts.

I made sure that I made at least eye contact with Kyra 
during the classes I shared with her and subtly built a 
closer relationship with Mark during the day until we 
shared a gym session at the end of the day.

We were playing basketball at an enthusiastic though very 
amateur level and my attempts to intercept the ball when 
Mark had it brought us into close contact in friendly 
conflict.  Once again, I made repeated eye contact and 
kept it longer than normally polite.  Mark had to be 
aware of me and, indeed, his eyes lingered longer on mine 
as the game proceeded.

There was a mutual yet unspoken delay in out leaving the 
courts for the showers.  My team, as losers, had the job 
of putting away the equipment - which today was half a 
dozen balls and a couple of rows of seats.  Mark spoke to 
the coach about some matter and I, of course, had to have 
a look around the storage area.  This meant we ended up 
in the showers as the last of the others were leaving.

I left a showerhead between us in deference to social 
propriety but in violation of the same "rules" I turned 
to face Mark whenever I spoke to him or while he spoke to 
me.  He saw me checking his equipment and I made a 
production of soaping then rinsing mine.

Nothing else happened.  I couldn't be too open - *THAT* 
might have been counter-productive.

"You played a good game Friday night Mark."

"Thanks.  I was luckier than usual."

"Do you always meet there or are there other places worth 
going to?"

"It's generally the Pool Hall Fridays; there's a club but 
that is better Saturdays.  You should come."

"Thanks.  Is there any age restriction?"

"Nah, though the younger kids stay away fortunately.  
It's unlicensed so if you're drinking you do it before or 
after or try to smuggle some in - but they are pretty 
strict."

"What's it called?"

"'Sharp Angles'.  No live bands but the DJ is good."

"People turn up about the same time as the Pool Hall?"

"Yeah - it's a bit more flexible since some people grab a 
bite somewhere first and then join in so it depends on 
how late they order and how fast they eat."

"Sounds good."

"See you then?"

"I'd expect so."

"Okay.  Catch you later then."

Was he looking at my buns of steel?  I certainly hoped so 
since our investigations had indicated Kyra was going to 
be a far harder nut to crack than Mark - probably in both 
cases due to his homosexuality.

Mark was gay in a town where his peer group would not 
accept a homosexual.  He had, as far as was known, a 
single gay experience with one of the staff who looked 
after the house and grounds of his father's holiday 
property.  The staff member's body was found, or rather 
was presumed to have been found since it was identified 
from dental records and that was only possible because 
his lower jaw turned up almost whole.

It is possible, though unlikely, that he is alive 
somewhere but, if so, he certainly won't be giving 
blowjobs again.

Don't let anyone tell you my job isn't dangerous - if 
anyone could do it I wouldn't be paid so well.

So Mark doesn't want a girlfriend or to try to get one 
which I will show him is foolish.  He is lonely and 
should consider a closer friendship with someone who he 
feels to be a kindred spirit.

Kyra has always been close to Mark, though there has 
never been any suggestion her love for him is other than 
sisterly.  She too doesn't date individually though she 
is sociable with both boys and girls when the two of them 
go out with their friends.  There is also no evidence 
that Kyra has any lesbian tendencies which in some ways 
is a pity as I feel I might have been able to convince 
Anna to be useful.

Our psychologists evaluated the twins and decided Kyra is 
aware of Mark's preferences and believes bringing a 
boyfriend of her own into the house is only going to see 
Mark outed - hence her equally frustrated state.

Which is where I come in.  Charming, friendly, found sexy 
by both parties and now exhibiting an interest in Mark 
that both will have noticed.

I was pleased with my progress.

Anna was waiting and we could talk openly on the walk 
home.

"Your hair is still wet.  Wouldn't you have liked to have 
me in the locker rooms to dry it for you?"

"You know very well if you were there, hair drying would 
be one of the last things on my mind.  Would you be 
planning on being there when there was only us or perhaps 
you would greet the whole class as they came off the 
court?  Think of it - fourteen heavy pricks swinging from 
side to side then they catch sight of a beautiful teenage 
girl and *SHWANG*!"

I extended my arm and raised it like a fascist salute.

"Am I?  Beautiful?"

"I think so and I'm sure they would, especially if you 
were suitably undressed."

"I don't think I could take care of fourteen pricks."

"Hmm, but you'd probably have fun trying."

"I think I need more practise with one; plus you're 
discrete.  You *ARE* discrete?"

"Oh sure.  I only told one person and he's probably only 
told three or four and they don't talk to anyone."

Anna punched my arm.  "Be serious!"

I had been, perfectly.  The people in question just 
hadn't been to high school for years and years.

"Yeah I guess if you were to look after fourteen of us 
the rest of the school would be sure to hear and then 
they'd feel left out.  How many guys do you reckon go to 
our school?  Oh, and the teachers.  There might be a few 
girls who would be interested in getting a hand from you 
as well, but if not, they are probably going to be the 
ones out for blood when they see their boyfriends lined 
up in front of you.  Yep, you'd better think carefully 
before you take on fourteen - I've heard girls can get 
rather violent; they've even been known to swing a punch 
at someone who upsets them."

I dodged said punch.

"I don't want fourteen; I'm happy with the one I've got."

"Ah well, can I interrupt that bliss with a question?"

"What?"

"Did you happen to get Rosalee's phone number today?"

Anna cooled noticeably.  We walked a block in silence and 
I was smart enough not to try to change that.

""Yes!" she said abruptly, "And Hailey's!"

"Thank you."

"You'd better make it up to me tonight though."

"Anna, I would do my best for you even if you tear them 
up and refuse to let me have the pieces.  Being with you 
isn't a bargaining chip.  Going out with the others is 
the price I have to pay to keep our secret safe.  I'm 
looking at dating a couple of girls at least so they 
don't look on me as being at their beck and call.  I'll 
be polite and interested but still looking around and not 
planning on going steady."

"And I sit home!"

"And what happens in a couple of weeks when I suggest you 
go out with me rather than one of them?  Will your 
parents raise any objections?"

"I don't think so."

"Would that happen if I told them I was taking you out on 
Friday and Saturday nights?"

"They'd probably find we were spending the weekend at 
Grandma's and hadn't let me know; then they'd make a 
hasty call when we weren't around."

"And if we have to go to the mall on Saturday or maybe a 
jog on Sunday?"

"That would probably be okay."

"So are my plans that bad?"

"Yes - but I guess you need to do it.  I still want 
something special tonight though."

I had to think.

---

Homework was a little rushed.

"I was going to have a little run before dinner if that's 
okay; before it gets dark."

Ma was agreeable, Anna upset - she still had some work to 
do and couldn't run with me.  Still she only pouted a 
little in my direction and I was pretty sure she would 
accept my apology when I saw her later.

I changed the chip in my phone and made a call when I was 
two houses away.  Then I turned my phone back off again.  
It would have registered on the network for maybe thirty 
seconds and would not appear again unless I had a similar 
need.  My run would have to take me about an hour and I 
did need the exercise so...

There was only one person approaching the bushy area 
around the cycle track that served for all non-automotive 
purposes such as jogging or, as the middle-aged woman was 
doing, walking a pair of dogs.  In her hand she had a 
plastic bag that appear to have been used to collect an 
odd dropping or two.  I hoped if she wasn't my contact 
she wouldn't object to being mugged for a couple of dog 
turds.

She released the bag with no sign she had ever had it and 
I slipped it inside my top and zipped it back up.  I was 
sure somewhere behind me she would have taken a second 
bag out of her pocket and would appear no different to an 
observer.

I really did hope I didn't have the dog crap though.

Home again, I dropped the bag in the bushes at the side 
of the house before letting myself in the back.

"Sorry I was so long.  I'll know my way better in 
future."

"Freshen up and join us.  Your plate is still hot."

The family had waited a while but Ma wasn't about to let 
a meal spoil.  Anyone who couldn't be there got their 
meal put aside and if it dried out that was their concern 
- they had better eat it regardless though if they knew 
what was good for them.

I quickly showered and took my place with another 
apology.  The meal was good and it *WOULD* have been a 
shame to let it go to waste.

"Where did you run?"

I explained and as they followed the route mentally I 
could see them realising that I wouldn't know the return 
leg would have taken me out of my way instead of bringing 
me home on time.

"There's a smaller path before you cross that first 
bridge that would have been better."

"I saw that but thought it was a private path.  I could 
see people crossing the second bridge and thought I'd 
just have to get down there and I'd be almost home."

"Try the other path next time - it will save you at least 
fifteen minutes."

---

I dropped off my side of the roof and walked around the 
darkened house to where I had left my parcel.  Inside 
there was dog crap but it was only the plastic joke kind 
together with a receipt from a joke shop and a personal 
fan in a long cardboard box.  I checked it out and found 
it was suitably muted.  Just what I wanted.

It was a simple matter to reach the roof from Anna's side 
and once again her window was open for me.  I just knew 
one day Doug and/or Ma would be in there waiting for me.  
I was familiar with the story of Rapunzel and, though the 
versions I had heard didn't suggest she and her prince 
got up to any of the hijinks that Anna and I found so 
pleasant, there must have been something to keep the 
Prince coming back.

Anna was reading through her homework when I poked my 
head through the window - the homework I had left her 
with when I went on my run.

"Finally!"  It was surprising how much frustration could 
be expressed in a whisper.

"Sorry.  What?"  Was it silly to apologise without 
knowing what for.  No!  *THAT* was the silly question.  I 
was male, Anna female.  If there was *ANYTHING* wrong it 
was my fault and hence an apology was required to 
acknowledge I recognised I was in the wrong.  It was up 
to Anna to explain exactly how this had come about.

"I've read this thing through three times."

So?  She couldn't have found something else to do while 
she waited?

"It really makes no sense."

Ah!  "Let me see."

I sat down on the bed.  Anna shifted to give me room and 
I slid a leg behind her so girl and book were both in my 
arms.

"Here."

I read the offending passage and re-read it a second time 
myself.  It really *WAS* impossible to make sense of.  I 
turned back a couple of pages and re-read the topic.  
Anna held the book while I turned the pages with one hand 
and held her breast with the other.  She leaned back 
against me and almost purred.

"Can we do our homework like this all the time?"

I continued reading without answering.

Okay.  Section A built the ground work but then we jumped 
to Section C with no indication there should even be a 
Section B.  No wonder it didn't make sense.  Anna was 
trying to mix a little A and a lot of C.

I tried to remember what I had crammed into my head.  
Normally I was a little more prepared for an orderly data 
retrieval.

My problem was that I had been taught in two different 
ways.  One, reinforced with practise, had been how to do 
things.  They became automatic reactions and important 
skills.  The second way had imparted often encyclopaedic 
quantities of raw knowledge in certain subjects.  While 
it was *THERE* I didn't always understand it until I 
could review it in context.  I was more idiot savant than 
genius but without the idiot - at least I hoped so.

Eventually I was able to fit the necessary missing 
information into place and could finally explain the 
economic theory that Anna had been set as a study piece.  
She grabbed her worksheet and this time I held her book 
while she filled in the few paragraphs to complete her 
task.

"There!"  She carelessly dropped her paper on the floor 
and covered it with the text book.

"I was going to tell you off for leaving me to go on your 
silly run but this was a much cosier way to finish my 
homework."

"But it was only for you that I went out."

"Me?  Why?"

"To get you a present.  You asked for something special 
so I got something."

"I meant you had to do something special!  You didn't 
have to buy me anything."

"So you don't want it?"

"W-e-l-l, it wouldn't be polite to refuse a gift and I 
wouldn't want you to have wasted your money."

"Oh, I could always give it to someone else."

"Like Rosalee I suppose.  Did you call her?"

"Yes, we're going out Friday night."

"In that case you can give it to me.  See I'm being 
perfectly reasonable about her."

"More than reasonable Sweetheart."

"Don't call her that.  Please, don't call any of them 
'Sweetheart'."

"Okay - you'll be my only sweetheart then."

Anna, pleased, snuggled into me as I sat behind her.  I 
let her lay against me for a little while, caressing her 
as we appreciated the quiet noises of a sleeping 
household.  Our whispered conversation would possibly 
have been heard by someone with an ear pressed to the 
door but that would have been all.  Now there was nothing 
but an occasional sigh or murmur of satisfaction.

I interrupted our peace by tapping Anna twice.  Three 
times was more significant but she seemed to understand 
this meant "excuse me" rather than "here I come".  Anna 
leaned forward to allow me to get out from behind her but 
I merely leaned over to grab the black plastic bag I had 
dropped by the bed.  I ignored the dog crap and pulled 
out the small box.  The rubbish went back to be removed 
later.

I settled Anna back against me and showed her the box.

"Huh?"  I guess a fan seemed an odd "special present".

"Open it."

Anna carefully prised the end open and shook the contents 
out.

"Where are the fan blades?"

At least she hadn't said, "Is this it!?"

"That's just what's on the box."

"Oh.  Oh!"  Things had fallen into place.

"Is it loud?"

"Rather depends on where you plan using it.  Here, you 
should be okay.  At the dinner table or in school, 
well..."

"I wouldn't use it at the dinner table."

"Oh but you would in school?"

A mischievous face turned and grinned at me and I kissed 
her temple.

"Well there are a couple of boring classes."

"Economics?"

"Some parts of the 'Business Principles' course but 
that..."

"It would be too easy for your teacher to track down the 
source of the buzzing."

Anna was playing with it now to see how much noise it did 
make.

"Of course if you could get all the other girls in your 
class to use theirs at the same time...  No then it might 
sound like a jack-hammer."

"You think they have them too?"

"I couldn't really say but I will find out, if you like."

"I don't like actually."

"Then you'll have to ask them yourself."

"I wouldn't know where to start; what to say."

"Make some joke about Mr. Buzzy and see how they react.  
It's likely to be the quietest ones who have their own 
little friend."

"Why the quietest?"

"Well the ignorant are going to look puzzled and say 'I 
don't get it' or maybe ask for an explanation.  Those who 
know but don't do are going to explain it and those who 
have a private secret aren't going to want to share it.  
Would you?"

Anna thought about having her pleasures curtailed through 
a careless word.  When everyone else *WAS* doing it, no-
one cared any more; it was when you were ahead of the 
pack you worried the others were chasing you to bring you 
down rather than to follow your lead.

It was for that reason that not a hint of our other 
exploits had escaped her lips, not even to her closest 
friends.  Now she was thinking what she could say that 
would be taken as boastful lies to be treated as "I'm not 
really expecting you to believe me" so others wouldn't 
apply my logic to what *SHE* wasn't saying.

"How do you use it?"

I suppose the obvious thing to do with a phallic object 
is to stick it where the phallus goes but sometimes the 
obvious thing is the wrong thing - or at least perhaps 
not the best right thing.  I certainly wasn't about to 
chide Anna for making sure.

"Are you nice and wet?"

"I think so."

"Well reach down and make sure."

I could see some of Anna's movements in the mirror on her 
wardrobe but I was better off imagining her fingers 
exploring down where I couldn't quite see them.  I made 
sure Anna's breasts didn't stretch under the effect of 
gravity instead.

"Yes"

"Well, spread that all around your clit, okay?"

"Ah-huh."

"Feel good?"

"*AH-HUH*!  I should have done this more often."

"Well it might get even better."

"Impossible!"

"So my tongue is no longer needed?"

"It's needed, I just won't feel so abandoned when I have 
to study alone."

"Slipping your hand inside your panties at the table 
while you work?"

"Maybe scratching the outside.  I don't know how much Ma 
can smell of me."  Anna paused, uncertain whether I might 
make fun of what she was about to say.  "When I take my 
knickers off sometimes it is so strong."

"Why?  You been thinking of me all day at school?"

"Some of it.  Especially towards the end of the day."

"Scratching at school too?"

Anna's ears turned red.

"Now I've got something to remember later."

"I want to wear you out so you'll need to go straight to 
sleep."

"Wearing me out before Friday, huh?"

"Don't talk about it.  Tell me what to do now!"

"Okay them.  Before you turn it on, see how it feels 
against your pussy.  Slide it around where your fingers 
are.  Let it get a little wet perhaps."  I was flying a 
little blind myself; perhaps *I* should have asked for 
instructions too, or perhaps a demonstration.  My dinner 
would have been cold or burnt or both in that case.

"Now turn it on and repeat what you've been doing."

"Ooo.  Nice tingles."

"Find out what you like but don't do only that.  You 
might like eating strawberries but they can taste all the 
nicer after a steak."

"Is that a hint?"

"Not just now.  Concentrate on what you can feel."

My thumbs were keeping her nipples busy - and hard - 
while positioning my mouth close to her ears so I could 
whisper meant I could also nibble on a lobe or her neck.

"Ready for something else?"

"Does it feel as good?"

"You'll have to tell me."

"Oh I don't want to stop."

"You won't have to for long.  Keep the tip where it is 
and lift the body away from your clit.  Let it find the 
entrance to your pussy."  (I wasn't about to call it a 
cunt or a vagina - one might put Anna off and the other 
sounded clinical when we were so cosy.)

"Don't push it in, just let it hum against the opening."

"That's as nice as when it was on my clit."

"It's sensitive right around there.  Enjoy that for a 
while then put it back near your button and so on."

Anna explored herself in ways I shouldn't have had to 
explain.  It seemed she had been neglecting herself.  Oh 
well, that was likely to change and, when I went, I 
wouldn't be leaving her without some source of solace.

"Now put it back at the entrance and very slowly slip it 
inside you.  You need to find out how deep you can push 
it in but you don't want to hurt yourself."

"Oh my god.  It's all inside me.  What if I can't get it 
out?"  She seemed to be trying to catch hold of the end 
with her nails.

"Ease up a second.  It's not going to be a problem - the 
batteries will be flat by morning."

"That doesn't worry me," Anna replied after she realised 
I was joking.  "How am I going to change the batteries?"

"Do you want me to get it out now?"

"If you are sure you can, I quite like it there.  Does 
your prick buzz too?"

"No, but it has some other qualities you might enjoy."

"I don't want to risk getting pregnant though."

"There's always a little risk but I have condoms if we 
decide we want to have sex.  There's no hurry is there?  
This seems enough fun for now."

"But you're not getting any attention."

"I've got a nearly naked girl in my arms who's been 
remembering for me in all sorts of ways that I've never 
seen before.  Tell you what; use your fingers to play 
where the vibrator isn't reaching and let me have a 
taste.  That should tide me over until you've finished 
coming."

"Finished coming?  What do you mean?"

"Well, once, twice, three, twenty-three times.  
Whatever."

"Twenty three!  You're joking."

"Well I don't know what's possible.  You might be sore 
and definitely would be tired but from what I've heard 
you could reach double figures without too much trouble 
and maybe twenty-three is low for the record."

"Now you've got me curious as well as worried.  I'll have 
to do a web search to see what the record is."

"I'd just enjoy them while they come.  How about you 
imagine you're on the end of one of the locker room 
benches with me instead of here.  I'm holding you and the 
other guys stop as they come out of the showers.  They 
are all dripping wet but they can't believe you're wetter 
and you haven't been in the showers!  You're poking 
yourself with the vibrator and rubbing your fingers 
around.

"With your legs spread wide like this they can see 
everything and one or two start to rub themselves.  They 
aren't the only ones who are hard though and soon 
everyone is beating themselves while they watch in a 
circle that starts and ends either side of us."

I had to pause.  Anna had changed hands and her fingers 
temporarily filled my mouth.  Wider than any dentist's 
tongue depressor they pulled my jaw down even as I swept 
the coating off of the block of digits.

"Mmm, sweet."

I could feel Anna's arm moving.  She hadn't commented on 
my little story but all the signs indicated it was not 
without effect.

"Where was I?  Oh that's right.  You are looking from one 
to the next, imagining their hard pricks in place of the 
vibrator.  Would they push themselves into you at the 
pace their hands are moving?  What would that one feel 
like?  He's longer than the others.  And that one?  It 
must be twice as wide!  You imagine being spread around 
it; feeling every movement in and out again.  That boy 
moves his hands ever so slowly.  Would he caress you the 
same way?  Massaging your tits as he fucks you.

"And that one looks terribly strong.  He should be able 
to hold you in his arms while you sit on his prick, or 
perhaps he could hold you upside down while you eat each 
other.  Can you feel his tongue tickling you while your 
own weight holds your mouth on his prick?"

Anna nodded and whimpered at the same time.  I knew 
better than to stop and hoped my imagination would last.

"Then what of the next boy?  He has some length but it 
appears at the expense of its width.  Ah but you've been 
thinking of using your mouth and this one might slide 
right down your throat.  Do you try?  Of course.  You sit 
up and readjust yourself so that you are astride my legs 
instead of between them.  You lower your pussy onto my 
prick after discarding the vibrator and I fill you.

"Your new friend comes closer and you smile to yourself 
as you anticipate feeling your nose being tickled by the 
curls at the base of that thin shaft.  You lick your lips 
and he presents himself for a kiss.  You give it to him, 
right on the tip where you can see a pearly droplet.  
It's sweet, almost as sweet as your own and you let the 
head pass your lips.

"You can feel me twitch inside you though we both remain 
still.  I have my hands on your shoulders, pulling you 
further onto me, and at the same time I can see his belly 
coming closer to your nose.  You have your hands on his 
hips now, controlling what he does.  There is to be none 
of the forceful fucking you've imagined from the other 
studs.

"You take him deep, to the back of your throat, then 
slowly make him ease out.  Back in again, it's a mouthful 
that you haven't chewed properly, you savour the taste 
and can see and hear his appreciation.  Once more and 
this time you're successful.  It fits your throat and you 
wonder whether to try now or to let this just be a 
practise - oops, too late!  He's eased forward and you 
feel him going deeper.  You grab his butt and pull him 
towards you.  Your eyes cross as you try to look at his 
belly and you feel your nose pressing against his skin.

"Then, over the top of your tongue the surges start.  
He's filling your stomach directly and you can't even 
taste him.  It's over too soon and now, as he pulls back, 
you finally taste the cum.  You suck and the last drops 
vanish down your throat as well.

"He steps back and you swing your leg over my shoulder so 
you spin around while still embedded on me.  You lean 
forward and stand just a little so you can bounce your 
butt cheeks on my lap while your finger finds your clit 
again.  We're fucking and you swing your hips so my prick 
makes big lazy circles while it's buried inside you.  You 
come and squeeze hard around me.  I can't stop and 
fountain up inside you and you know you've been filled 
from both ends.

"The others who have been watching fill the air with 
streamers of cum.  Most lands on the ground, some on the 
other guys and spots here and there on you.  It's been 
the best gym shower ever."

I finally came to an end.

"Oh my god!  I asked for something special but I 
never..."

Anna lifted up the vibrator and switched it off.

"How did you get it out?"

"Somewhere after the second time it got pushed out by 
itself."

"The second time?"

"I think there were five but I'm not sure.  I was paying 
too much interest to the story and might have missed one 
- or rather missed counting one.  There were a couple of 
times which I might have been supposed to count - I don't 
know."

"Ready for twenty-three then?"

"I don't think I want five like that again in a hurry.  
Five over a couple of hours sounds manageable.  Now I 
feel like I need to sleep."

"That's okay.  Why don't you suggest a nice safe place to 
put your toy and I'll tuck you in for the night?"

"Stay there for a while, please."

The vibrator landed on top of the text book and Anna 
rearranged herself so she was still between my legs but 
lying down with my thigh as her pillow.

I ran my fingers through her hair and brushed the back of 
my knuckles over her cheek.  Anna responded by bending my 
prick to her lips and suckling on it like a baby at her 
mother's teat.

Her lips moved back and forth across the rim around my 
knob as she made short, quick sucking motions while 
holding my foreskin back.  It was a rapid mini-fuck that 
felt good and I continued to caress her face.

If Anna had been affected by the story I hadn't been 
immune myself and it only took a couple of minutes before 
I had to give Anna three warning taps.  She didn't ignore 
me but I didn't expect her to roll over onto her stomach 
to get even more depth!

Oh well.  She knew what to expect though this time there 
were no tissues handy.

I had spoken of fountaining into her vagina; now I did it 
into her mouth and though I felt the extreme pleasure of 
her swallowing while I came, I also noticed a puddle 
growing around my member - held back only by the tight 
seal of her lips around my shaft.

Anna sucked me dry as if I was the young man in the 
story.  Unlike him, Anna had tasted every drop of my cum.  
Since she had kept her place throughout when I knew she 
didn't really enjoy it I had to feel privileged.

Anna put her head back on my thigh.  "Thank you," she 
said.

"Thank *YOU* Sweetheart," I answered in turn.

I let Anna drift off before carefully escaping and put 
the vibrator into a pair of knee high socks folded into a 
bundle about twice the length of the slim plastic tube.  
Anna could find a more permanent place in the morning.  I 
retrieved the box and the rest of my items and headed 
back for a *VERY* well earned rest.
