The day of the disaster you're trudging to school, kicking up clouds of dun-colored dust as you shuffle your feet, when the sky goes blindingly white. You close your eyes. You open your eyes. You don't see the cragged turf, the haphazard tatter of buildings, the flinty, scudding sky of Troy. You see a bronzeish and shadowy arc, its surface scored by a tangle of wiring, which, after a moment, you identify as a ceiling. You turn your head. A bank of indecipherable electronics squats nearby, with two people (strangers) attending to its readouts. Standing next to them, all stillness and indifference to the machines, is you. Evidently you're lying here, horizontally, on what feels like a bed or table, and also standing over there next to them. You blink.

"She's awake," you say. That is, the other you. The adults turn -- a man and a woman.

"Hello Sharon," the woman says. "Don't be afraid. You are a child of God."

When you move, your muscles feel jellied and creaky, as if (like the girl in the fable) you'd slept for one hundred years. You look down at yourself; mirroring the others, you're wearing only a shapeless grey shift. Your feet, your hands, the legs, stomach, face that you can touch with them, all these are familiar -- your body. Your mind, your memories. Are they memories? The dinner table laid for an occasion, with real meat to eat and candles that make the faces ranged around them flicker; the spires of Aerelon City, its greenery and bustling market squares, and you holding tight to someone (father's?) hand; a history lesson, in the cinderblock schoolroom: a servant class of robots called Cylon Centurions, rebellion/untold slaughter/armistice, the value of humility before the Gods and respect for the limitations of technology -- all these seem to float and ripple, as if submerged.

"Who are you?" Yes, that's your voice, if froggier than usual.

One hour later, these are the things you know:
• your serial number is 08-0022P
• the "P" stands for "prototype"
• you'll now be addressed as "Twenty-Two"
• your double is named "Sixteen" (which, incidentally, is how old you are)
• this is a facility for production, research and training
• what it produces is you -- you're one of a new breed of cylon, which the Centurions were called by God (only one God?) to create
• your mission is to eradicate the human race
• your parents, your friends, your teachers are dead -- Troy mining colony has been completely annihilated

One hour later, you're locked in a bare metal room, after you screamed and kicked and bit and cursed these vile interlopers until the Centurions subdued you by force. Sixteen comes to visit you every day (you might as well call these indeterminate periods days) until you're raving and broken enough to talk to her.

You sleep in a featureless dormitory with 24 beds. When you're awake, you file along to classes and tests: engineering, tactics, protocol, athletics, of course the unrelenting monotheism, and more injections and electrodes and examinations than you can count.

When you're supposed to be sleeping, though, is when you get your real education. Flocks of you huddle on mattresses, whispering. Each of you is minutely distinct, and among only Model Eights these variations are magnified -- there's the romantic and the scientist, the gossip and the goody-two-shoes, the melancholic and the zealot. Nine, for example, is a scamp, and likes to hack into classified systems when the staff isn't looking. "I think," she reports, "that the main component they're trying to perfect is memory. For an infiltrator, you know, the fullness of human experience is an invaluable asset. Far more efficient to retain it through the cloning process than to attempt to manufacture and teach it." Sometimes the older ones know the most. "Four told me," Sixteen recounts gravely, "that they're going to select one of us to be a sleeper agent -- to go back to Sharon's life, without remembering any of this." Sixteen is still your inseparable companion, and often stretches out in bed with you after the rest have gone to sleep. Her iteration didn't take well, and she has only dreamlike shreds of life on Troy. She tends toward the sentimental, though, and always asks for your stories (which you enjoy chronicling because it's a way for you to keep them). "I took exams last season," you tell her, "six hours of writing in what they call the gymnasium -- it's really just a bigger room with lines painted on the concrete floor -- in high summer heat. Ugh, it was hell, and plus I studied nonstop for months beforehand. Right before all this," you wave your hand to indicate the identical girls, the ominously functional architecture, your new and ill-fitting identity, "I got the letter awarding me a scholarship to the military college in Aerelon City. Mom and Dad were so proud that they took me out to the pub and let me drink..." You pretend you're not crying (you're a cylon now), but Sixteen twines her arms around your neck anyway, and holds you close. She kisses your neck, your cheek, the corner of your lips, and before you know it you're smooching open-mouthed. "Did you ever do this with a boy?" she asks.

There's kissing every night after that, and tentative explorations of hands underneath the baggy shifts (which offer little in the way of barriers). "Sixteen, that sleeper agent?" You're on top of her, the pressure of her thigh between yours making you buzz maddeningly, her face framed by the black curtain of your hair. "I'm going to be her. I mean, I'd give anything to be Sharon again and go to school in Aerelon City and have all these memories wiped. I can do the best on all the evaluations, I know I can. But listen, if I am picked, and I go off to live as human while you're still a cylon, you have to come and find me. When I'm activated, and everything comes crashing down around me, I want you to be there when I wake up. Like you were the first time."

Sixteen traces your cheekbones with her fingertips and says, "OK, I will be -- I promise."
