<b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>Gwendoline
was inconsolable for days after hearing Harriet's news and nothing anyone
could say or do could help lift her spirits.&nbsp; Jim reflected rather
bitterly that if he were going abroad for a year, his newly - wedded wife
would bear the thought of his absence with a great deal more fortitude,
indeed, he thought that she would scarcely notice he was gone!</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>It was not until mid-July when
the day of Harry's leaving was only a week or two away that Gwen realised
that she must come to terms with the temporary loss of her dear friend
and pay more attention to her husband whose hurt she came to realise and
reproach herself for.&nbsp; From then on she threw herself energetically
into helping Harriet complete all her travel arrangements and bravely hid
her grief from view.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>Two days before Harry was due
to leave, Gwen was told by her doctor that her suspicion she was pregnant
was correct and this gave her more to think about than her impending loss.&nbsp;
An heir was what this very tradition conscious lady wanted more than anything
else in the world - someone to keep the family's ancient line alive for
another generation.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>She told Harry her good news
at the airport.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>"You must be the Godmother,
my darling Harriet.&nbsp; We won't have the baptism until you are safely
home in dear old England.&nbsp; Look after yourself, darling and don't
forget to let me have your address - I'll write every day - maybe ten times
a day.&nbsp; God bless you my dear!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>The two friends embraced and
kissed passionately for the last time for a year. Harriet went into the
Departure Lounge and once she was out of sight&nbsp; Gwen abandoned herself
helplessly to her grief.&nbsp; Jim tenderly wrapped his arm round her shaking
shoulders and helped his distraught and weeping young wife to their car
and the journey back to Hampshire.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>................................................................................................................................</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>Harriet sank into her comfortable
seat in the first class cabin and felt the plane leave the tarmac, headed
for Africa and a life of service to others and hard physical work - she
could never decide which of the two was the more important to her, most
likely the latter.&nbsp; As the realization of what and whom she had left
behind come home to her, her elation faded and a sense of desolaton seized
hold of her and she realised that she was crying and feeling every bit
as unhappy as her weeping friend, all those thousands of feet below, becoming
more and more distant from her with every second.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>"Oh Gwen, my darling.&nbsp;
What have I done to us both!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>......................................................................................................................................</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>On arrival at the capital city,
she was met by Simon Westhouse, the local representative of the voluntary
organisation she was working for and he drove her to her hotel.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>"I daresay you'd like a few
days seeing the sights before you get started on the project" he said in
a friendly tone.&nbsp; There's no desperate need to chuck yourself in at
the deep end!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>"I came here to work,&nbsp;
Simon.&nbsp; I'd like to start tomorrow - in fact you can drive me straight
there to the site if you like.&nbsp; I'm not here as a tourist"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>He explained that one or two
formalities needed to be completed first and she must contain her impatience
at least until the next day.&nbsp; For whatever reason, the said preliminaries
were quickly sorted out and on the evening of her first full day, she was
being shown her very primitve quarters in the rural settelement that was
to be her home for the next twelve months.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>Her first act was to write to
her friend in England.&nbsp; She gave the letter to Simon to post when
he returned to the capital.&nbsp; She was to write every day for the whole
of her time here and receive reams of correspondence in return, but the
missives tended to arrive for both girls in batches of five or more, owing
to the irregularity of the postal services in that part of the world.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>She had spoken&nbsp; to Gwendoline
on the phone after her arrival and the sound of that beloved voice coming
from thousands of miles away but sounding as if her darling were in the
next room had almost broken her heart.&nbsp; Both girls had tried to sound
cheerful and positive, but neither was fooled.&nbsp; Each could sense the
pain in the other's voice.&nbsp; Once again Harry asked herself what, in
Heaven's name , she had been thinking of in coming out to this distant
place so far from all she held dear.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>At the end of the day she went
to bed and in seconds, the pillow was soaking as she shed tears for those
happy times in the winter, which were now gone for ever.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>She awoke in the morning, and
went out into the bright sun, already hot&nbsp; as an English summer at
noon.&nbsp; She recalled her early childhood, spent in a different part
of this same vast continent and began to feel better.&nbsp; It was like
a kind of homecoming as she experienced all the old familiar sounds and
smells .&nbsp; True, as a child she had enjoyed a life of privilege and
comfort and now she would be working hard all day and every day, having
to put up with primitive and insanitary conditions, but this was what she
had wanted and the feeling of loss&nbsp; began to die away - after all,
a year is nothing and would be over before she knew it!</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>The only other English person
here was a young, studious looking fellow called Bernard Holmes.&nbsp;
He looked at the well-built newcomer with approval and took her out on
an early morning tour of inspection to familiarise herself with her duties.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>"I know you want to work at
physical labour, Lady Harriet, but there are plenty of locals with muscle
- what we have to remember is that we have the expertise and know-how and
that is what is lacking here.&nbsp; You will need to take some kind of
managerial role and be responsible for supeervising others as well as working
hard yourself."</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>How fucking patronising, thought
Harry - I'm sure these villagers know more about local conditions and needs
than we ever will.&nbsp; She contented herself with nodding and asking
Bernard - how unlike the other Bernard - to call her simply Harriet.&nbsp;
"You'll soon learn I'm not much of a lady", she joked.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>The first project she was employed
on was the laying of water and sewerage&nbsp; pipes to link up with the
main system some miles away.&nbsp; This would entail&nbsp; digging, laying
pipes and then&nbsp; replacing the soil..&nbsp; There was no machinery
and all the work would have to be done by hand.&nbsp; Her spirits lifted
as she heard&nbsp; all this.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>The pipes were delivered by
truck and the first task was to carry them to be stationed at intervals
along the line of the projected main.&nbsp; Harriet surprised everyone
by&nbsp; hoisting two large sections of the drain onto her shoulders and
carrying them&nbsp; as if they weighed no more than a feather.&nbsp; The
men of the village, who had been inclined to undervalue the woman that
had been sent out, began to look on her with respect&nbsp; as the day went
on and her tireless energy showed no sign of wanimg&nbsp; They even started
to wish she would show some sign of weakness and give them a chance to
relax.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial TUR"><font size=+2>When she went to bed at the
end of her first real day, she felt much happier, in fact she felt very
happy indeed.&nbsp; Only one thing was missing, though.&nbsp; It had been
so much more enjoyable working naked.</font></font></b>
