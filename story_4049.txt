I hope everyone has read and enjoyed "Summer Holidays" 
(published on mcstories.com) by Downing Street, a sequel 
to his fabulous "Lovebright Academy." (ibid.) In that 
earlier story, Downing Street left out some critical 
elements, which I felt compelled to revise in my 
"Lovebright Academy: the Real Story."

Unfortunately, it's happened again, although this time I 
think it must be from ignorance of what went on AFTER the 
conclusion of "Summer Holidays." You should, of course 
read that story first because it was complete as far as 
it went but afterwards ... With Downing Street's

SUMMER HOLIDAYS: Epilogue (MC, Mf, Ff, preg, humor)
By Homer Vargas (Vargas111@yahoo.com)

***

Jimmy lay with closed eyes soaking up the sun of the long 
July days that were marching slowly toward August. Here 
by the pool at the sumptuous home of the parents of 
Cloeme, his current girlfriend, it would be hard not to 
feel some self-satisfaction with his accomplishments. 
Certainly the De Winter family was more laid back, 
libidinous and, therefore, happier than before.

Philip De Winter's import-export business, where Jimmy 
helped out occasionally advising Philip, had been 
transformed from a stodgy, post-imperial holdover into a 
vibrant, up-to-date emporium. New staff, mainly hot young 
women, had introduced new life and a trendy, almost racy 
dress code to the old firm. Profits had soared and 
generous bonuses made the new employees more than pleased 
to be working for such an enlightened entrepreneur as 
Philip De Winter. Nor were the young women shy about 
showing their appreciation to Mr. De Winter and 
occasionally to Jimmy himself. Mr. De Winter usually had 
to set aside a whole afternoon with each grateful 
employee.

Felicia De Winter had changed even more. No longer the 
rigid, uptight matron, she had become an affectionate, 
fun-loving wife. Her new wardrobe of short, clingy skirts 
and high heels in brilliant colors was emblematic of her 
new happiness. She had a lot to be happy about. Every 
night she was getting screwed silly by a surprisingly 
rejuvenated Mr. De Winter. Then, too, she had discovered 
that, far from being a vile and degrading practice, 
allowing Philip to eat her to orgasm after orgasm was 
altogether delightful; she even found herself moved to 
reciprocate. A nice 69 before breakfast had become her, 
and of course Philip's, favorite way to start the day. Of 
course she had Jimmy to top her up most days at siesta 
time.

And Amber. Jimmy was most pleased about the improvement 
in Amber's status. From being a frightened and underpaid 
house slave she had become a valued and well-remunerated 
domestic employee. She, too, knew how to show gratitude 
to Mr. De Winter, usually in the den when he arrived each 
evening and occasionally to Jimmy, whose "good vibes" she 
knew were somehow responsible for her change of fortune.

Yes, everything was going well and Jimmy might well have 
allowed things to drift, pushed along as by the gentle 
summer breezes, giving no thought that this idyllic 
holiday would ever come to an end. But Jimmy was a 
conscientious young man. He was concerned that all this 
carefully crafted happiness might crumble once he and 
Cleome returned to school. People had a way of falling 
back into their dysfunctional habits if they had nothing 
to anchor them to their new lifestyle. Jimmy was 
particularly worried about Amber. Would Mr. De Winter 
continue to be as generous with the girl after Jimmy was 
gone? Especially if Mrs. De Winter reverted to HER old 
ways? Quite probably, no. Amber needed something to 
cement the bond with Mr. De Winter, something she could 
share with Felicia De Winter, something to make her a 
more integral member of the family.

And Felicia De Winter. Jimmy knew that at bottom she was 
not a bad woman. Her former hauteur and self-centerdness 
resulted mainly from boredom. Felicia lacked a purpose in 
life and it made her flighty and shallow. Mrs. De Winter 
needed a goal, something to absorb her energies and take 
her outside herself.

But that would be difficult so long as she was exposed to 
the influence of the ladies of the Art Auxiliary. Oh, 
they were OK right now, meeting weekly at the De Winter 
home for drinks of Amber's special punch and exchanging 
hilarious bedroom stories about how their new wardrobes, 
hairstyles and, in some cases, surgical enhancement, had 
prompted their husbands to nightly paroxysms of sex. Yet 
Jimmy feared trouble when the summer was over. Like Mrs. 
De Winter, these women needed something to occupy their 
attention and distract them from petty gossip and 
competition over their possessions and their husbands' 
careers.

Jimmy was aware that he had his work cut out for him. He 
was of half a mind to take matters into his own hands, 
but he realized that in these cases it was better to work 
indirectly. He would have to begin a series of talks with 
Amber, with Mr. and Mrs. De Winter, and with the ladies 
of the Art Auxiliary. Summer was more than half gone and 
time was of the essence. He would begin ...

Jimmy's reverie was interrupted by a small, soft hand 
insinuating its way under the waistband of his swim 
trunks. Cleome had awakened and had scoonched even closer 
to him, pressing her pert breasts tightly against his 
side. Somehow her top had come off and Jimmy could feel 
the urgency of her hard nipples. He would have to hurry; 
Felicia would be expecting him in her bed shortly. 
"Jimmy, honey, you haven't done me since breakfast. I'm 
so horny." Jimmy wondered if perhaps Cleome had drunk too 
much of Amber's orange juice this morning, but there was 
no remedying that now. Her hands were tugging insistently 
at his trunks and he was only barely able to pull a sheet 
over them to prevent the obvious from becoming explicit. 
"Oh Jimmy, baby, fuck me. I need it so bad," she pleaded 
as she impaled herself on his erection.

He would begin ... tomorrow.

*****

How time had flown! Felicia could hardly believe that 
more than three months had slipped by since the last 
gathering of the Art Auxiliary. Events had conspired to 
keep the group apart since back in the middle of the 
school holiday. First, almost everyone had suddenly 
decided to go on long August vacations. Felicia herself 
nearly had to drag Philip away from his beloved business. 
She had made sure he didn't regret the three weeks in 
Barbados, although for modesty's sake they didn't get 
much of a tan. The lovebirds hadn't fucked that much 
since their honeymoon. By the time they had returned it 
was the end of summer and many members, like Felicia, 
were busy packing their children off to boarding school 
or university. Finally there was shopping. Lord, it was 
difficult to keep up the same level of sexy allure in 
fall fashions as it had with skimpy summer clothes. And 
then Felicia found she had to go out and buy still 
another set.

So here it was almost Halloween, but at last everyone 
could be assembled. Amber had prepared the punch that 
everyone remembered so fondly. Felicia was so much 
looking forward to the party. Especially with her 
surprise.

Nicole Loring was the first to arrive, several minutes 
early. Felicia hardly recognized the woman. Nicole had 
never been as prudish about dressing as Felicia used to 
be, but this outfit was practically obscene. The red 
leather miniskirt barely covered the essentials. She 
still wore matching four-inch red spike summer sandals 
that exposed her brightly painted toes, notwithstanding 
the nip in the air. The sheerest of black stockings 
caressed her shapely legs. Her blouse conspired more to 
display than to conceal her breasts, which seemed to be 
larger than Felecia remembered them. And she was glowing. 
Felicia led her friend to the living room and soon the 
two women were seated facing each other, each grinning 
like the cat that had swallowed the canary.

"I've just got to tell you first," both women blurted 
simultaneously. They paused in surprise and giggled.

"What is it?" both asked.

"You'll never guess!" they replied in unison.

"You don't mean ..." the two women gasped.

"Yes, it's true!" they squealed together.

"I'm PREGNANT!"

*****

Several hours, numerous pitchers of punch, and uncounted 
platters of canaps later, a roomful of tipsy women were 
giggling and exchanging stories like teen-age girls at a 
sleepover.

"Fred was so funny about it," Cindy Van Dorn confessed. 
"As soon as I mentioned that I might even be WILLING to 
have another baby, he raced upstairs, cut my diaphragm to 
slivers, and flushed my pills down the toilet. The silly 
boy doesn't know a woman's fertility does not return for 
weeks, and of course I didn't tell him," she giggled. "He 
didn't let me out of bed the whole weekend. I was sore on 
Monday, but it was worth it."

"You TOLD him?" Alice Court chucked. I just dumped my 
pills and booked a cruse for Paul and me around my 
estimated time of fertility. I didn't ask permission; I 
just came back with his baby right here," she announced 
triumphantly, patting her tummy.

"I don't know what happened," Constance Mason admitted. 
"I had always told Arthur very firmly that I would NOT 
have another child, but some time in August I kind of 
started to forget to take my pills. And I was so horny 
all the time, I was practically raping him morning and 
night, hardly in a good bargaining position to insist he 
wear a condom. I was as shocked as Arthur was overjoyed 
when I missed my period."

"'Horny' is the word," agreed Agatha Carrolton. "I 
thought I was eager BEFORE Ralph knocked me up, but now 
I'm insatiable."

"Me, too," agreed Grace Bradock, "But I've got two happy 
school boys who take turns tiding me over in the 
afternoons until Peter gets home each night."

"Oh, you witches!" exclaimed Felicia. "All this sexy talk 
has given me a wonderful idea ..."

*****

When Philip arrived Amber quickly escorted him to the 
living room. The scene unfolding before their eyes was an 
astounding one. It had begun when Felicia suggested they 
compare incipiently bulging tummies and swelling tits. By 
now all eight women were stripped down to noting but 
their stockings and heels. It was a draw between the 
couples that favored the pussy-to-pussy scissors grind 
versus those who felt a 69 was the surest way to 
continuous orgasm.

"See. I told you we wouldn't have to worry," Amber 
whispered to Philip who was goggle-eyed watching his wife 
alternately scream, mew, and gurgle ecstatically in the 
arms of Nicole Loring. He almost jerked Amber's arm off 
as he hauled her toward the den.

Sometime later Amber, having been munched to a series of 
satisfying orgasms, was astride Phillip De Winter who was 
panting on the brink of his own orgasm. Smiling slyly, 
Amber dropped into the character she knew would send the 
poor man into orbit. "You love Mommy Felicia, don't you 
Daddy?"

"Huh?" the distracted man groaned. "Yes. <gasp> Of course 
I do, Amber."

"I mean you must REALLY love her?"

"Yes ... yes ... ,<pant> ... 'love her."

"You loved Mommy enough to make a baby in her, didn't you 
Daddy?" Amber felt her employer's engorged cock swell 
even more inside her.

"Huuu?" was the most insightful response his sex-addled 
brain could come up with.

"You wanted give Mommy a round pregnant belly and big 
milky boobies for you to love, didn't you, Daddy?"

"Ohmygod! ... Amber!" he shuddered.

"Do you love your little Amber, Daddy?"

"Love? ... Amber? <gasp> Yes, ... yes," he croaked as 
Amber picked up the pace just slightly.

"Wouldn't you like to give your little Amber a big belly, 
too, Daddy?"

"Oh, Amber, honey! What are you doing to me?"

"You don't have to do it if you don't want to, Daddy. But 
I stopped taking those old pills you have been buying for 
me. I though that now Mommy is having a baby for you, 
maybe you'd want to give your little Amber a baby, too."

"Amberrrr!"

If you do, Daddy, I promise I'll let you drink the milk 
from my boobies. Would you like that, Daddy?"

"Amber, please! Honey!" Phillip squawked, panic and 
desire in his voice.

"Would you like to get your little Amber pregnant? You 
didn't put on a condom today, Daddy. Does that mean you 
want your big bare cock to pump little Amber full of your 
baby juice?"

"No, Amber. ... Yes Amber. ... Ohhhhhhhh!" came his 
tormented cry,

"You DO, don't you Daddy? I can feel it! You want to 
knock up your little Amber. You want to put your baby in 
me and make my little tummy real big!"

"Amberrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!" Philip screeched and started 
bucking uncontrollably.

"Yes, Daddy! Yes! You're doing it. You're going to make 
me so preggie! I can feel you shoot, Daddy right into my 
fertile little pussy. Oh thank you, Daddy. Thank 
youuuuuuuuu!" she cooed as the flood of hot semen 
triggered her own orgasm.

*****

Wreathes of spruce, holly, and twinkling lights adorned 
the large De Winter living room. The thoughtful hostess 
had thrown soft warm mats onto the floor for the comfort 
of her guests. Uncounted quarts of non-alcoholic eggnog 
had been consumed that afternoon. These gatherings had 
become more frequent as the eight weeping pussies needed 
more and more attention as their pregnancies progressed. 
Much as their husbands loved to try keeping their horny 
wives satisfied, they were, after all, only men.

The women were relaxing with a few final lazy orgasms 
before heading off into the frosty air when Felicia got 
to her feet. "Girls, before you go, girls, I have a some 
happy news," the hostess announced. "Nicole, pay 
attention, please" she hissed under her breath, shoving 
the too-avid woman's face from between her legs. Around 
the room seven pairs of heavy-lidded, climax-sated eyes 
looked up at her.

"I'd like us to welcome a belated member to our Joy Luck 
club," she paused. "Amber, come in here, sweetie."

At first there was stunned silence, then "Uuuu's" and 
"Ahhh's" and "Isn't she ADORABLE!" broke out as the young 
maid stepped into the center of the room. Proudly she 
lifted her short skirt and apron, showing her bare belly 
and pretty puss. Felicia smiled and held out her hand. 
Amber tripped over to the older woman who drew her down 
and gaily patted the girl's just-visible bulge. "Since 
*I* didn't go straight from birth control to fertility 
pills like SOME people," she smiled at Emma McPherson and 
Jane Farragut who were contemplating their hugely 
stretched bellies, "I'm only having one this time. So 
Phillip decided Amber could have one of his babies, too. 
I know you'll all do your part to make Amber feel a part 
of the group."

While the little group applauded, Nicole's eyes lit up. 
Crawling rapidly to the youngster she thrust her head 
between the girl's thighs.

Just like Jimmy told her, everything was working just 
fine.
