Summary: Married couple have a plan to keep their sex life interesting (swinging)
*****************************************************************
My husband and I have an arrangement that seems to be different than any we have read about.  It started about a year ago when we were talking about getting more excitement in our sex life. We are in our early thirties and have been married about 10 years with no children. Both of us are fairly average looking and had a few lovers before we met. 

After trying the usual fantasies during sex and doing it in different places, we were running out of ideas. I was sort of complaining to my mother, who is widowed and in her early 50s. She gave me a long look and asked if I'd like to know how she and my father solved the problem. We are pretty close so I took the chance and told her that I was interested. 

She explained that once a month they scheduled a 12 hour period when they took their wedding rings off and were temporarily "single". Each could do what they wanted during that time with no recriminations afterwards.  When the time was up they would get back together in bed, put their wedding rings back on, and share their adventures with some very hot sex.  The excitement carried over until the special night so they always semed like newlyweds. 

Needless to say I was surprised!  I knew that my folks were pretty cool about sex but never imagined HOW cool. I had a million questions which mom tried to answer.  The arrangement had gone on for many years until dad got sick. At first they just screwed each other on "dates" but then each met other partners who usually became long term lovers. They didn't do threesomes or swapping but Mom said that sometimes she would even have more than one lover on a given day. Answering my concern, she ststed emphatically that the extra sex with others only increased her desire for and enjoyment of sex with her husband.  

I told mom how much I appreciated her sharing that with me and that she was a very special woman.  On my way home I was very aroused and trying to figure out how to explain this idea to my husband.  We had fantasized a bit about "sharing" or "swinging" and it got him aroused so I brought it up during sex right after dinner without telling him where the idea came from. Both of us got off really hard. We talked about it almost every night for a month with plenty of sex for punctuation. Since I get extra horny just before my period so we set our first time for then. Our first outing consisted of us going separately to a lounge and my husband picking me up and taking me to a hotel room with us each using made up names. Not too wild but a good start  I really wasn't too comfortable going off to who knows where with a stranger so I started looking for a long term partner among the men I met or knew in some way. 

We set up our 12 hours from 9am to 9pm on a Saturday and would decide ahead of time who would go out and who could be at our apartment. It was my turn to be home and I invited over a 20 year old guy who had done some computer work for us. He was reasonably attractive but a bit of a geek and I had found out he didn't date much. It was easy to seduce him and we fucked a lot before my husband came back. He had a substantial and continuously hard cock but little experience. His big pecker kept me filled most of the day as I showed him delights he had only read about. I was bursting with pride, excitement, and cum as I waited in an obviously well used bed for my husband to get undressed and join me. There was no foreplay needed so he slid right into my dripping pussy and shot his load quickly. As we lay together I told him about my day and he got hard again without even leaving my cunt. We both commented about the slippery erotic feeling of cum from two different men and had another great climax. We agreed that this was great fun and fucked like crazy every day. 

The next month I fucked my 20 year old and then my husband who hadn't yet found a female partner. I was feeling a bit selfish because I had met a nice 30 year old guy at a service club I belong to. I wanted him between my legs too but wanted to get my huband laid first.  All of a sudden it dawned on me. I could repay my mom for the wonderful idea she had given me. I called her and told her that on our next special day I would send my husband over to "help her out" and she should take full advantage of him.  That's exactly what she did and they both loved it. It was wild feeling my husband's dick in me soon after it had been inside my own mother and I climaxed repeatedly even after all the screwing with my young man. 

I realized that a month was along time for my 20 year old and my mom to wait for sex so arranged to have him teach her how to use a computer. She loved teaching him a lot about women and they would get together several times a week. Since a lot of single women avoid married men I played matchmaker and got my husband fixed up with a shy and horny divorcee from the club I belonged to. With my help he also gets to bang a married friend whose husband liked to share.

With that taken care of I could really let loose. One morning my husband give me a quick fuck so I would be nice and wet for the next cock. I arranged for my 20 year old to come over for a piece right after my husband left, then I went over to my 30 year old lover's place for before and after lunch sex. Dinner and "dessert" were at the 20 year old's apartment. My pussy was wet and tingly all day. My husband knew my plan so he arranged to couple with all three women that day as well. At 9pm the rings went back on and my husband and I had some nice gentle lovemaking as we shared our fun of the day. We were both pretty fucked out so only our minds were "hot". After a good night's sleep we made up for that though! 

This arrangement is working well for us (and several other satisfied people). Our marriage is strong and exciting in all the other important ways as well. It is difficult to describe the feelings that I have when I get back together with my husband though I have tried to explain them to him.  When he slides his familiar hard cock into my juicy and sometimes tender pussy I am thinking of several things at once: the other cocks that were in there earlier; the other mens' cum that is now coating his cock; that his cock was in other cunts today.  Each of those thoughts is erotic in its own right but together they really get me off.

Our partners are wanting to be with us more often and we are getting a bit addicted to the excitement and pleasures of the extramarital sex and the sharing of it with our spouse. Since the twelve hour sessions are difficult to schedule more than monthly, we are considering three hour "ringless evenings" once or twice a week. Sounds like fun to me!
