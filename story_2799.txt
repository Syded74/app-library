*******************Unforgettable Times: Part-4*******************************

It was again a lovely spring morning. A mild touch of cold was back with a feeble northerly breeze. There 
is always a hide-and-seek play between feeble northerly cool breeze in the morning and not so feeble 
lukewarm southerly breeze in the afternoon of Spring. To tell more correctly, that is how Spring used to 
be, during my childhood and early youth.

I had taken my bath early in the morning and put on a fresh set of kurta-pajama. We were expecting the 
girls' group to arrive anytime. In fact, Dida had  invited them for breakfast too. Chandan was expected  
later in the day, as he was quite busy with his family and friends.

We were on the terrace, enjoying the soft northerly breeze, which was getting milder and warmer with time.
 We saw the girls coming. Keka-di was wearing a lovely saree on an off-white base. We were seeing each 
other on the fourth day and it was the fourth saree that I was seeing. Today, she was looking amazingly 
beautiful and was having a look of freshness after the bath. I managed to whisper into her ears - "You 
are looking more beautiful than ever before." She blushed- "Chup karo !"

The presence of five of us made the breakfast table really noisy. Just three days back, we had a boy-girl 
barrier between us and today, all of us were so close friends. Surely, each of us was consciously trying 
to forget the sad fact that it was our last day together and making more fun between us was the only way 
to ensure that.

Dadu took us to his room. He was a famous personality, who came in close contact with Rabindranath Tagore.
 All of us could understand his eagerness to share his nostalgia with the younger generation. All five of 
us were sitting in his room. There weren't enough chairs, so we were managing our places between his cot 
and the floor. He was talking about  paintings and explaining the different styles and methodologies that 
he had seen. Abhirup and Sonali, that means his grandchildren had lots of interests and knowledge about 
art and painting. Papiya and Keka-di too were  good listeners and I guess both of them had a level of 
knowledge and abilities  way ahead of mine. About me, less said the better. Nripen babu, our art teacher 
in the school used to tell me every time after the "Drawing" exams - "Swagato, its so difficult for me to 
make you pass this subject." Thank God, the marks of Drawing exams didn't form a part of the aggregate. 
Otherwise, I am sure, Abhirup would have taken an unbeatable lead over me everytime.
 
I was getting bored, because I couldn't understand anything out of the topic. I knew it would look bad and
 would be disrespectful to the old man if I had left the room, but at one stage, I made some pretext of 
going out of the room.

I was walking around the garden of "Nirala". The name of this house was "Nirala", meaning solitude. Every 
house in Shantiniketan has a name, a tradition initiated by Tagore. The garden in Spring was looking 
beautiful - the colours, the fragrance and the wandering of bees around. I went to the upper floor of the 
studio house, where we were staying. I kept the windows open, allowing fresh air to fill the room. I 
wanted to spend some time with myself. There was a transistor radio set in the room. In those days, we 
were too fond of radios and gramophone records. The "idiot box" was yet to damage our cultural and social 
life. 

The radio was on. Closing my eyes, I was listening to Sagar Sen  softly singing a touchy Tagore song:

"Prem esechhilo, nihshabda charane....." 

In my life too, love came so silently ! The contradiction between my dreams and realities was making me 
sad.

****

"Ki korchhile, ekaa ?" I didn't notice when Keka-di had walked in. Perhaps her steps were too silent.

"If I say, I was thinking of you."

"No, no Swagato. Didn't I tell you to forget me ? " I sensed Keka-di was unable to keep her voice steady.

"How do I Keka ? How do I ?" For the first time, I dropped the suffix "-di". 

Both of us were silent for a few moments.

"Why did you come here ?" I asked.

"I was unmindful. Couldn't concentrate on Dadu's topics. With Abhirup , Sonali and Papiya  deeply 
engrossed into it, I thought I needed a break." She paused and continued, "No, no, I didn't tell you the 
truth. I just wanted to be with you. Only that !"

"Keka !" I cried out, throwing my arms to her for a deep deep embrace.

"Would you just sit down beside me for a while ?" I asked. She sat down next to me on the bed. We were 
looking at each other's eyes.

"Ki chaao ?" was her shortest possible question. It sent triggers to me. My body was roasting with a heat 
that was coming from within. I knew what my body wanted, but do I ask for it ?


"If I say, I want everything, would you .. would you ?" Perhaps, that's the question I wanted to ask. But 
no, I couldn't put forward that question. I had to understand the realities. Despite my own urge and 
fantasies for lovemaking, I wanted her to remain perfectly "pure". Readers may start endless debate with 
me about associating the word "purity"  with virginity. Its definition may change from time to time, 
place to place, but that is what we were tuned to believe in our Indian society and culture. 

"Ektuku chhnoa..." my reply too was as short as her question. Just the first two words of the song which I
 was still singing within. 

I brought my lips to hers. Close, closer and then came the final moment of touch. I can't describe what 
was going on within my body, within my mind - a kind of feeling that is difficult  to narrate. She opened 
her mouth, so did I, breathing deeply through each other. Our wet tongues started exploring each other's 
mouth, as much deep within as possible. 

"Ohhhh, naaa Swagato,... eiiiii.... ki korchho... lokkhi  aamaar...." she said with a voice that was 
softer and huskier than her usual one. It was more like a mumble, but there was such a deep feeling of 
liking within her, within me.

"Keka-di, bhishon......bhishon bhaalo lagchhe, ....aami chharbona....Keka-di, aami chharbona..." I said, 
moving deeper and deeper into my hitherto unknown territories of love, where I wanted to remain for ever. 
When breathing was getting more  difficult with the tightness of our embrace, we moved our lips apart and 
started caressing each other with our fingers. When my fingers rested upon the softness of her breasts, it
 caused an electrifying sensation in me, as if I reached the point of explosion.

"Keka-di, did you sense my accidental touch here during colour play ?" I asked. Now, my nervousness wasn't
 there any more.

"I did. You know one thing Swagato ? God has gifted us with more senses than what you would ever imagine. 
And a girl rarely makes a mistake to understand what is intentional and what is not, what is decent and 
what is not. The touch signals her everything to the brain."
I pressed her breasts. Everything was so soft inside that I didn't feel like hurting her with anything 
more than that degree of gentleness.

"Can't I rest my face here Keka-di ?" 

Before I could complete my plea, she dragged me close within her valley between the breasts. The buttons 
of her blouse was interfering with my nose. She herself realized it and unbuttoned the top two buttons, 
exposing her bras.

I now kissed her valley. One, two,...more, more and more......My passion was driving me to move my mouth 
uphill, but she reminded me to apply  the brakes.

"Aar naa.. lokkhi....lokkhi amaar...kathaa shono....er por .....er por aamio aar samlaate paarbonaa je..." 

"Keep the remaining for later. I won't be there in your life then, but someone, surely someone very very 
nice," she continued. I realized that my hardness was resting on her thighs and still throbbing. But I 
listened to her warnings and got up, but not before yet another deep passionate kiss.


"Oh no ! Look at yourself ! You   have lipstick marks on your lips...ishhhhh" Keka-di smiled, as she 
buttoned her blouse and re-adjusted her saree into position. Before I could look at myself on the mirror,
 she came to me with her handkerchief and wiped those marks off.

I quickly grabbed the handkerchief from her hands and said, "This will remain with me for ever as a 
souvenir of today."

"Rumaal chor !" she scolded me. ( Rumaal chor is a kind of game which kids play in Bengal, using the 
handkerchief).

"I couldn't steal you. Just managed to steal this handky." I said. Perhaps my words brought in an 
atmosphere of sombre and I had to soften it out.


"Won't you sing, Keka-di ? You had promised." I reminded.

"I will. Only for you." she said.

"Then do"

The words of the song which she sang were touchier than any other song that she could sing at that moment.
 It tells the lover to remember her for ever. The lyrics and melody is unforgettable, perhaps one of the 
best creations of Tagore. From my own ideas about Tagore songs, all that I can say is that singing this 
song is not all that easy. The song belongs to the "tappa" category. It requires a special skill and 
devotion. Only top class  singers dare to sing it:

"Tobu mone rekho,
Jadi doore jaai chole...."

How could she sing so perfectly ?  As I was realizing each and every words of it, I had to turn my eyes 
away from hers. Just to hide my emotions.

I was stunned after listening to her song. One doesn't find this level of singing talent too often.

"Eto sundar !" That was the only praise I could utter.

"Ke kaar kotha bolchhe ?" she asked with modesty.

"Keka-r kotha bolchhi". Both of us laughed together, having used our rich language in an ornamental way.

"Now you sing a song." she requested.

"Keka-di, since last two days, I have been singing only one song within me. The song of touch, the song of
 love in Spring -

"....Jetuku jaay re doore
Bhaabnaa knaapaay sure
Taai niye jaay belaa
Noopur-ero taal guni
Rochi mamo phaalguni
Ektuku chhnoaa laage
Ektuku kathaa shuni..."

"Would you let me learn the tunes from you ?" she asked.

"Okay, sing with me .." I said. We sang together.

It was almost twelve o'clock at noon. Abhirup, Sonali and Papiya were still with Dadu. Chandan was yet to 
come. Dida was preparing our lunch.

"I think I should leave now and try to help Dida. You be here...." Keka-di left my room. The fragrance of 
her perfume and the fragrance of hers remained. I was left alone with the intense heat of love still 
boiling within me. 

*********

Chandan was perfectly on time for lunch. Dida had prepared "khichuri" (a delicious mouthwatering blend of 
rice, lentil and Indian spices) and it was ready, just piping hot. Khichuri is generally served with some 
fries and in our case, it was small cut pieces of brinjal (aubergine) fried in a batter. Keka-di had 
taken charge of the frying process and most of the fries were stolen by us before it could reach the 
dining table. It was a great fun, when myself and Abhirup together carried the largest sized casserole, 
filled with steaming hot khichuri.

"Oh, that's great ! You know, we are going to enjoy today's lunch with one more item. That's Dida's 
limericks." Chandan made an announcement in the dining table.

"Wow ! Never knew that Dida composes limericks. " All of us expressed our joy simultaneously. 

There was so much of fun at the table. Dida was reciting some limericks from her memory and a few were 
composed instantly. A few of those referred to our group of six. I was just amazed by her talents.

After the lunch, Dida requested us for songs. Dida also joined our group for the afternoon, making it a 
group of seven. This time, I didn't sing the love or spring songs of Tagore, rather picked up a few from 
his devotional (Puja) songs. Keka-di sang only one song, with the best of her talents :

"Nibhrito Pranero Devataa, 
Jekhaane thaaken ekaa-----"

All of us were speechless and felt that no amount of praise would do justice to her talents. Dida said, "I
 wish you had stayed back in Gurudev Rabindranath's place for ever. How could you pick up this Rabindrik 
style ?"

Her versatility is unimaginable. When Dida left our gathering, the same "Rabindrik" singer started singing
 the modern Bengali songs recorded by Lata Mangeshkar.The one which is still ringing in my ears is : "Aaj 
ei mon cheye cheye aami haariye jabo ---". Papiya was equally talented. She sang a few Hindi songs from 
its golden era, recorded by Asha. All of us were enjoying our own Lata-Asha combination as much as the 
records of real ones. 

Dusk was setting in. We were still on the terrace and were in no mood to depart. All of us were trying to 
prolong our stay as much as we could. 

"Tea is ready. Who is going to carry the tray up stairs ?" Dida called us from the garden.
A cup of tea always prolongs the chat session. So it did.

It was time to keep the tray with used cups back to Dida's kitchen. I started carrying it, but Keka-di 
came running.

"Come on, be careful ! Don't spoil Dida's lovely bone china tea set. Let me help you." So, we came 
together.

While coming back to the terrace, Keka-di wanted to use the bathroom attached to our room. When she came 
back, I couldn't help embracing her once more. As my hands travelled through her shoulders, her back and 
upto her buttocks, my tool again stiffened, like a rock.

"Keka-di, once more, please, once more" I begged.

"Be careful of the lipstick this time....Ummmmm.....ummmm...eiii...eiii....ki korchho....lokkhi amaar.....
 byaas....eibaar chharo ..." The smell of hers had become so familiar to me by now.  

"I'm not afraid of your lipstick any more. Your handky remains with me." I said, waving her handky.

"Rumaal chor !!! Give it to me for a minute, then it will be yours." She took the handkerchief and wiped 
her face.

"Swagato, would you just sing the sanchaari of the song once more ? I have a small doubt, you know..." she
 asked me. I was still singing within me and now I sang aloud,

"...Jetuku kachhete ashe kshaniker phnaake phnaake,
Chakita maner kone swapaner chhobi aake ....."

When we went back to the terrace, Papiya asked, "Didi ! You took so long a time ?"

I was nervous. Are we under suspicion  ? My heart was throbbing with a nervousness.

But I admired the boldness of Keka-di. The question was asked to her and she didn't fabricate any lie. 
Just said, "Learning a song from Swagato..." 


*************

Our final evening was over. Abhirup and I were alone in the room of "Nirala." We had decided to get into 
the early morning passenger train, so we had to wake up well before dawn. Can call it a "wake up", because
 I didn't sleep for the night. All the time, I was thinking of Keka-di. I felt, she was still present in 
my room. 

I was fondly thinking of my moment within her breasts. If it had happened this way ? I imagined -

I opened the next button of her blouse, ..then the next one.. then the last...then taking the  blouse  off
 her hand. I imagined, and I could, because it was my  own world with no restrictions in it. Then....just 
an unhook to remove her bra...I slowly took it off her body. Slowly, because I want to prolong that 
moment...the greatest moment when I would get my first glimpse of her lovely assets. I continue to move my
 mouth up the hill, up all the way through her softness, slowly, then reach the stiffness of her peak,
 which  so prominently indicates its presence. I lick there,...and lick...and lick while I softly massage 
the other member of her pair of treasures. I keep her saree away, untie her petticoat.. slowly...slow 
enough so that I can enjoy the moment of her ultimate nudity. Now she unfastens my pajama, takes it off my
 feet. We embrace again, closely, in our nudity and then again put our lips together, travelling to a new 
world which I explored only today. She touches my hardness, helping it to get harder and harder. It was 
resting between her legs, a wetness, a softness ...no no, it was getting difficult for me to imagine. I 
didn't know  anything about its soft and slippery feelings, only whatever my imaginations could permit, 
but something I wanted in the ultimate, with a rhythm. 

I was still singing within me-

"....Jetuku jaay re doore
Bhaabnaa knaapaay sure
Taai niye jaay belaa
Noopur-ero taal guni
Rochi mamo phaalguni
Ektuku chhnoaa laage
Ektuku kathaa shuni..."

Now a wetness was filling my eyes. Abhirup was sleeping. So, none could see it.

**************

I never knew that a dawn in spring was so beautiful, our planet is so lively with the birds' harmonious 
songs. I had my last look at Nirala. The green turf was moist with fresh dew. The rickshaw was taking me 
and Abhirup to Bolpur station. The same rickshaw puller Jhontu, who had brought us from Bolpur station 
four days back.

"You know dadababu, Gurudev-babu knew my father very well." he said, as he carried us through the roads of
 red gravels. I could then realize that every dust particles of these red gravels carried the fond memory 
of our greatest poet Rabindranath Tagore.

We were back again to Bolpur station. Keka-di and Papiya were already there. Sonali had come to see them 
off.

It was time for the passenger train to steam in. The passenger train was destined to go till Sealdah 
station and it was convenient for Keka-di and Papiya to get down in their town on the way. We could have 
gone all the way upto Sealdah to reach Calcutta, but the passenger train was notorious for its delays and 
excessively long scheduled arrival time. So, the plans were that we would get down at Burdwan station and 
then get into Dhanbad-Howrah Coalfilled Express to reach Calcutta faster. I had a hectic day in store. I 
was supposed to have lunch with my parents in Calcutta and then proceed to my hostel by the evening train.

As the passenger train steamed in, I had the first feel of missing those four unforgettable days. Sonali 
was in embrace with Papiya nad Keka-di, with tears rolling through Sonali's eyes. In the meantime, Chandan
 also arrived with his cycle to see us off.

"Swagato, promise me - when you come next time, stay with me." he said.

But then, what about "Nirala" ? Our affectionate Dida ? Which one am I going to forget ? 

We said goodbye to :

"Moder Shantiniketan ....moder sob hote aapan amaader Shantiniketan...."

**********

Four of us were in the train - Keka-di, Papiya, Abhirup and me. We were singing. Just to prevent the 
sombre mood of the final moments of our togetherness, we were singing songs of joy - songs from Satyajit 
Ray's classic comedy film "Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne".

"O re Bagha re...Goopi re....ebaar bhege pori chupi chupi re....."

Everytime, we were singing this song, the train was coming to a halt with a jerk - ghyaachhhh....

After a brief pause, again the engine was sounding its whistle "koooohhh" and we could hear the noise of 
steam puff release. 

"Dekhe bichitro ei kando karkhanaa,
Eder rakam sakam giyechhe janaa....Bagha re...Bagha re...."

"I wish the train reaches Burdwan very very late, so that you miss Coalfilled..",Papiya was telling. So 
let's sing again,

"O re Bagha re...Goopi re....ebaar bhege pori chupi chupi re....." 

Unbelievable ! Again ghyaachhh.....! The train halted.

Again it started. No, finally, we couldn't prolong our journey, despite our wish. The train was entering 
the platform of Burdwan station.

We got down. Coalfilled Express was running 15 minutes behind schedule.  We still had some time  on the 
platform. We were standing beside the window of the passenger train, where Keka-di and Papiya were 
sitting. Before the passenger train blew its whistle, I touched Papiya's hands. In those four days, I had 
developed a sisterly feeling towards her. And then I touched Keka-di's hands - for the last time.

The guard waved the green flag and the train slowly steamed off with a puff. I was waving at them, they 
were waving at us. But why was my vision getting blurred ? Was it because of the steam puff or something 
else ?

I was feeling weak. I grabbed Abhirup's hands for a support. The band-aid was still there on my toe. But 
the blister had disappeared with a loving touch - a loving touch which every man  needs.



Coalfilled express was running in its own rhythm. With that I mixed the rhythms of :

"....Jetuku jaay re doore
Bhaabnaa knaapaay sure
Taai niye jaay belaa
Noopur-ero taal guni
Rochi mamo phaalguni
Ektuku chhnoaa laage
Ektuku kathaa shuni..."

**********

After many, many years, I was travelling by the same route. This time, I was alone , enjoying the 
comforts of air-conditioned chair car in Shantiniketan Express. I was reading a magazine, using my bifocal
 lenses. The earphones of my walkman were plugged into my ears. I was listening to Antonio Vivaldi's 
"Four Seasons", specifically the melodies of Spring. No wonder, romantic Spring is always so beautiful in 
every composer's imaginations.
