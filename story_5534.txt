Three


I spent most of the weekend taking pictures downtown and trying
to put Nicole out of my mind. I didn't exactly regret what had
happened, but screwing around with another guy's fianc wasn't
something to be proud of. Besides, I had more important things to
worry about. The quarter was nearly over and finals would begin
next week. All of the serious students were living on caffeine
and starting to twitch nervously. I didn't quite fall into that
category, but I still had a lot of work to do.

Historical buildings were my final project. I made my way past
city hall, the misty backdrop of rain subduing everything into a
thousand shades of gray. Then a narrow swath of golden light
spilled down from a break in the clouds and fell onto the capitol
dome. Two women sat talking on the steps, the colors of their
hair and clothes suddenly blazing to life in the sun. I stopped
and focused my lens, managing to get in a half-dozen shots before
the sky closed up again. Sometimes it seemed that the world was
only a collection of images; beautiful moments that ended all too
quickly and would never happen the same way twice.

Sunday evening I was putting the last touches on my photography
project when my cellphone rang. I checked the number and was a
little surprised to see it was Nicole. For some reason I'd
started to feel that I wouldn't be hearing from her again.

"Hi," she said when I picked up. "Am I interrupting anything?"
Her voice was quiet and seemed to have a tired edge.

"Nope, not at all. You okay?"

"Yeah," she answered softly. "Just burnt out from studying." She
paused for a moment, then sighed. "Actually, I think I'm gonna go
nuts if I don't get out of here for a while. Would it be okay if
I came over?"

"Sure, stop by whenever. I'll be here."

We said goodbye and I went back to work, wondering what she had
in mind. She probably just wanted to take a break and decompress
for a bit, though I still felt a slight rush of anticipation.

Ten minutes later, Nicole was at my door. Her lips were chapped
and several strands of her chestnut hair had escaped from her
ponytail to dangle beside her face. She definitely looked
stressed. I let her in and sat with her on the couch as she began
talking about her classes and exams and her fianc who wasn't
calling as much as he used to. A lot of it was more than I really
wanted to know, but it was probably good for her to vent and get
it all out. I imagined she was probably tense, and after a short
while I moved close beside her and started rubbing her shoulders.
Her voice trailed off and she lowered her head as I firmly
massaged the junction of her neck and shoulders through the
material of her sweater. After a few minutes I pulled my hands
away and stood up.

"If you stop now I'll strangle you," she groaned.

I could tell by the look on her face that she was only
half-joking. Luckily for me I hadn't intended to quit just yet.
Guiding her down onto her stomach, I started working on her neck
and shoulders again as she lay stretched out on the couch. I
kneaded her muscles with a little more force, hearing her moan
softly into the cushion as I moved my hands over her athletic
body. I wasn't a skilled masseuse by any means, but when you have
relatives with chronic back problems you tend to learn a few
things.

Her sweater was starting to get in the way, so I pushed it and
her shirt up as far as I could to give myself better access. I
used the handful of freckles on her tan skin as landmarks as I
slowly rubbed my way down along her spine and to her lower back.
Just as I reached her ass, she raised up a little and undid her
jeans. I eased her pants down over her legs and off completely,
leaving her in a pair of white cotton panties and cute little
ankle socks. Nicole gave another soft little moan as I slid my
hands up along her thighs and began half-massaging and
half-fondling her tight little butt.

It was great to be able to take my time and explore her body
without feeling rushed, though rubbing the firm cheeks of her ass
was turning me on quite a bit. After a little while I stopped and
tugged on her shoulder, wondering if she'd let me work on her
front. I didn't need to wonder long. She quickly rolled over and
pulled her shirt and sweater off, then a moment later her bra
joined them. Her heavy tits bounced with her movements, and when
she settled back I caught them in my hands and kneaded, rolling
them around in slow circles on her chest. She laid there quietly
with her eyes closed, an expression of soft tranquility on her
face.

Gradually moving lower, I let my fingers glide down over her
stomach, enjoying the silky smoothness of her skin. I covered her
hips and thighs with stroking caresses, my hands often sliding
close to the crotch of her panties. Her breathing seemed to
quicken every time I touched her inner thigh.

I couldn't resist any longer. My hand trembled slightly as I
reached up and caressed the soft cloth-covered bulge of her vulva
before sliding my hand inside her panties. Nicole opened her
thighs slightly as I cupped her shaven pussy and started to
stroke it with slow circular motions, the warm, moist lips almost
sticking to my hand. I pulled my fingers away to get them slick
with saliva, and as they drew close to my face I could smell her
on them. It was a sharp, intoxicating scent that reminded me
almost of maple syrup.

Intrigued, I lifted her lower body and pulled her panties off. As
soon as I let go she moved her legs up and aside to present me
with a perfect view of her shaven pussy. The lips were a deep
pink color and curled outward like the petals of a flower. Her
naked curves and serene face made a rather beautiful scene, and
for a moment I considered asking if she'd mind me snapping a
picture. I quickly pushed the thought away, reminding myself just
how lucky I was to have a naked girl laying here in the first
place.

Forgetting everything else, I leaned in and gently tasted her. A
little more tangy than maple syrup, but still good. I began
flicking and swirling my tongue over her labia, my hand running
softly over her flat stomach. There was something especially
intimate about going down on a woman, much more so than with
fucking. I was drinking her in; inhaling her; enjoying the taste
and scent of her sex while her soft moans urged me on.

Nicole shuddered as I locked my mouth on the top half of her
pussy and sucked, sliding my tongue over her clit and upper lips
with slow, fluttering licks. I experimented with a few different
rhythms and had just settled on one when she suddenly gasped
sharply and twisted aside, trapping my head between her thighs to
keep me away from her twat. It took me a second to realize that
she'd come already. Apparently she'd really needed that. I was
actually a bit disappointed. I would've liked to have enjoyed it
for a while longer.

She released me and relaxed again, breathing heavily with her
eyes closed and her arms folded across her chest. I sat back and
let my hands stroke gently over her legs while she rested. After
a little while I noticed that her breathing had become very soft
and slow.

"Nicole?" I called quietly. Nothing. She'd fallen asleep. I shook
my head and smiled to myself as I went to get a blanket. It took
an effort to keep my hands off her after getting so worked up,
but somehow I managed despite the stiffness in my jeans. My cock
was literally aching with a combination of heat and pressure that
felt like it could only be relieved by a quick plunge into her
soft little pussy. I wondered if women ever got so aroused that
it hurt.

I forced myself to calm down and reluctantly went back to my
project, sneaking an occasional look over at Nicole as she slept
peacefully on the couch. It felt strangely good to have her
there. Her presence made the place a lot less lonely.

She was out for almost two hours. When she got up she checked the
time and quickly pulled her clothes on.

"Shit," she sighed. "I still have a lot of studying to do." She
finished putting her shoes on and gave me a hug, seeming tired
but a lot more relaxed.

"Thank you," she said quietly, resting her head against my chest.

"Anytime." I supposed that I meant it. After all, that's what
friends were for.

She smiled and left. I went back into my room and tried to
concentrate. I had exams of my own to deal with.

***

Finals came and went in a hectic blur. Then it was spring break,
and I ended up being stuck at home while most people went off to
have fun. Money was getting tight and it looked like I was going
to have to find a roommate to help with the rent. Maybe it
wouldn't be so bad. I was getting tired of living alone anyway.

The new quarter started, and to my surprise I discovered a
familiar face in my Spanish class. It was Angela. Almost two
months had passed since I'd seen her last, but just a sidelong
glimpse of her face was enough to make my pulse start racing. I'd
been telling myself that I was over her, but it was pretty
obvious that I was wrong.

I took my seat a few rows behind her. Angela's hair looked a bit
longer that it had been, but she still kept it wild like she'd
just woken up or had sex. She was wearing her black-rimmed
glasses and the piercings in her ears and nose glinted prettily.
For a moment I hoped that she wouldn't see me, then kicked myself
for being such a coward. So what if she had a boyfriend? That
didn't make it illegal to be friendly. A few minutes into the
class she glanced back and saw me. Her face brightened into a
smile and she gave me a little wave. I smiled back and returned
it, feeling my mouth suddenly go dry.

After class I went over to talk to her.

"Hey there," I said.

"Hey," she replied, grinning. "Long time no see, Mr. Cameraman."

"Yeah." I suddenly felt like a blushing schoolboy. "I, um, never
got a chance to ask how you liked those pictures."

"They were really great. Thanks." She started walking slowly and
I moved into step with her. We headed outside.

"I meant to call you," she added, "but I kinda thought you'd
never want to talk to me again after I stood you up like that. I
didn't mean to. I just had a lot of stuff happening at once."

"Sometimes things come up. It's all right." I tried not to stare
at her as we walked. She was just as beautiful as I remembered,
and talking to her again was reminding me of just how much I'd
enjoyed being with her. "I was kinda looking forward to seeing
you use chopsticks, though."

Angela gave a quick little smile. "No, it isn't alright. I'm just
glad you don't hate me." She paused for a second and looked me in
the eyes, the silver stud in her nose gleaming. "Do you?"

"Nope," I answered, holding her gaze as steadily as I could. "In
fact, I think you're thoroughly awesome." I winced inwardly as
soon as I said it, hoping that it didn't sound as lame as I
thought.

Her grin reappeared. "Well, you're pretty cool too." A moment
later she looked quickly away as if she was getting embarrassed.
We came to a halt outside the computer center.

"Rick," she began, suddenly looking serious. "I got back with my
old boyfriend. That's part of the reason why I couldn't go out
with you."

"I know," I said, managing to smile a little. "I've seen you two
around. You look good together."

"Thanks." She immediately seemed more cheerful. "So, can we be
friends?"

"Yeah," I answered, feeling a sinking sensation in my gut. "I'd
like that." Even though I'd known this was how things would be, I
hadn't needed it thrown in my face.

"I'd like that too."

"Okay. See you in class?" I asked, suddenly eager to be a million
miles away.

"Yeah. Catch ya later."

Angela turned and left. I walked off feeling like a fool. Somehow
it made perfect sense that I'd fallen in love with someone I
couldn't have.

On Wednesday Angela and I exchanged a quick hello in class, but
that was all. When the class ended I saw her boyfriend waiting
for her outside. He grabbed her and kissed her deeply while she
ran her fingers over the back of his neck. It made my stomach
twist into knots. I walked away, wishing there was some kind of
switch I could throw to shut my feelings off. Maybe it would rain
again.

Two weeks passed. Angela and I talked fairly often in class. We
always paired up during speaking exercises, though we couldn't
seem to go very long without cracking jokes or doing something
silly that left both of us giggling like a pair of
kindergarteners. We got along really well. It was great during
the three hours a week I had with her, but the rest of the time
it just made things harder.

I daydreamed about her like I was some lovestruck teenager. I
wanted to spend a day getting to know each part of her body. Or a
month. Or a year. I wanted to be able to know exactly what she
was thinking just by the way looked at me, or the way she moved.
I wanted to be the one she came home to, the one she laid down
next to at night, the one she woke up with in the morning. I
wanted too much.

My search for a roommate hadn't gone well. I'd had a few people
call, but they'd seemed kinda flaky. I told Angela about it as we
were waiting for our class to start one day. She mentioned that
Nicole might know someone who was looking for a place. The sudden
reminder that the two of them were roommates made me feel rather
uncomfortable. I wondered how Angela would react if she knew
Nicole and I had screwed around.

I talked to Nicole, though I felt almost guilty about doing it.
Her friend was a girl named Renee who wanted to get out of the
dorms and into a real apartment. The idea of having a female
roommate seemed a little weird, but I didn't see any major
drawbacks to it. Apparently neither did Renee. I cleared my stuff
out of the spare room that had served as my studio. A part of me
was sorry to see it go.

Renee moved in a few days later. She seemed pleasant enough, a
lively redheaded sophomore with a large build and striking green
eyes. She was tall and a little on the heavy side, but she was
definitely more curved than flabby. Nicole helped bring her stuff
over. Renee didn't have much in the way of furniture yet, not
even a bed. She seemed fine with the idea of sleeping on the
couch in the living room until she could get one.

After she was settled in, she and Nicole opened a bottle of wine
and talked for a while. I retreated to finish a paper for my
philosophy class. Nicole left a while later and my new roommate
resumed her unpacking. I could hear Renee moving around in her
room, humming softly along with her radio. It was something I
could easily get used to.

I finally finished my paper and came out to find Renee curled up
on the couch, her bare shoulder sticking out from under the
blanket. Her eyes were closed and her face was very peaceful. I'd
read someplace that the only time a person's true, natural face
appeared was when they were asleep and all their
self-consciousness fell away. As with most women I'd seen, Renee
was at her most beautiful when she wasn't trying to be.

Nicole dropped by again a few days later to hang out and watch a
movie. Afterward I went to my room to catch up on some reading
while she and Renee chatted, leaving my door open so I could hear
their voices. I didn't want to listen in or anything, I just
liked having them in the background. The sounds made the place
seem more alive. Renee seemed tired though, and before long I
began to hear more yawning than talking.

"Sorry," I heard Renee say. "These early classes are killing me."

"That's okay." Nicole responded. "Its getting late. I should be
heading back anyway. I'm just going to say goodbye to Rick
first."

"'Kay." I heard the door to Renee's room close.

A moment later Nicole came in, smiling wryly at me as I looked up
from where I'd been sitting on the bed. She didn't say goodbye,
or anything else for that matter. She shut the door and
immediately slid onto the bed, pushing my book aside so she could
sit almost in my lap. I caught the faint apple-ish scent of her
perfume as she leaned in and started kissing me with an eagerness
that made my head spin. It was hard for me to believe that she
could really want me so badly, but my doubts vanished as she
reached down and squeezed my swelling cock through my pants. The
touch of her hand combined with the sudden heat and hunger of her
kisses was making me incredibly aroused.

A little moan escaped Nicole's lips as I lifted her up by the
waist and tossed her back onto on the bed. She lay there watching
me as I undressed, her face seeming to flush with an expression
of breathless desire. I crawled over her and kissed her roughly
as I went about stripping off her clothes. Pulling off her shirt
and bra, I sucked one of her hardening nipples into my mouth
while working her jeans down at the same time.

When she was fully naked I paused for a moment to look at her in
the soft glow from the reading lamp. Her large tits sagged
slightly under their own weight, the nipples already erect. Her
labia were still partially hidden within the folds of her pussy.
The bare skin of her shaved twat was incredibly inviting, almost
asking to be touched and tongued. Happy to oblige, I moved in and
licked it slowly from bottom to top, her salty-sweet lips parting
as my tongue slid over and between them. I lingered with my mouth
on her cunt for as long as I could before the urge to fuck her
finally overwhelmed me.

I stopped just long enough to tug a condom on before I moved in
and pinned her to the bed. Stretching her legs out wide, I
positioned my dick against the mouth of her vulva and pushed in,
watching as my cock speared her lips apart and vanished inch by
inch into her pussy. My dick seemed almost huge in comparison to
her petite little body. Nicole groaned and dug her fingers into
my back as I penetrated her, then clutched at my arms as I began
pumping. She gasped as I fucked her harder, her eyes staying
locked on mine.

She felt even tighter than I remembered. Despite this she still
came first, surprising me by twisting around violently on the bed
and crying out my name. The wild ride was more than enough to
bring me over the edge, but just as I was about to come she
suddenly squirmed away from my cock, causing it to slip out of
her. I froze and tried to hold back, but it was already too late.
My dick throbbed in the open air as I had a frustrating
half-orgasm while still holding her tightly by the legs.

Nicole lay there panting, her arms crossed over her head. I eased
off and lay beside her, and after a minute she sighed and rolled
over to snuggle up against me. I ran my fingers gently through
her hair, feeling rather unsatisfied but glad that she'd seemed
to enjoy it.

After a little while she rose up and gave me a quick kiss like
she was about to leave. Then she paused, her eyes seeming to
wander over my face for a moment before she leaned in again for a
much longer and deeper one. I put my arms around her and pulled
her tighter against me, her tits pressing firmly against my
chest. Her hand wandered down over my stomach and came to rest
around my still-hard cock. Without breaking our kiss she peeled
the condom off and slid fully on top of me, squeezing my shaft
tightly between her muscular thighs.

She inched lower, kissing my chest as she let my cock nestle up
lengthwise against her pussy. I could feel the teasing warmth of
her soft labia as she slowly began rotating her hips. I'd been
using condoms for so long that I'd forgotten just how great naked
flesh could feel, even just rubbing like this. I supposed that
Nicole might have been thinking the same thing. She changed her
motions from circular to almost straight up and down, sliding her
pussy along the length of my cock with slow little fucking
motions. I palmed her ass and moved against her, feeling her
quick breathing warm my chest as she lay with her head turned to
one side.

Seeming to have teased herself enough, she suddenly rose and
climbed up to straddle my head. I grabbed her around the thighs
and pulled her to my mouth, sucking at her swollen lips and
flicking my tongue over the firm nub of her clit. She gasped and
lowered her weight down until she was sitting fully on my face
with her pussy nearly smothering me. I gripped her ass and licked
harder until she came with a sudden rigid lurching of her pelvis.
I eased off as her shivers stopped, remembering how sensitive she
got. Still enjoing the sexy smell and taste of her soft skin, I
held her by the hips and lightly kissed her shaven mound as she
fell onto her elbows to rest for a moment. I felt a bit proud of
myself for making her come so much, though I doubted it was
really anything special. Sex wasn't something I'd had a lot of
practice with. I just did what came naturally and hoped for the
best.

Nicole sat up slowly and slid back down over me, planting a
series of warm kisses along my chest until she reached my lower
stomach. Then, pulling me up into a sitting position on the edge
of the bed, she knelt down between my thighs and took my dick in
her hand.

"I want you to cum on my chest," she said in a low voice, looking
me steadily in the eyes. Her face was slightly flushed and very
serious. I felt a rush of heat spread through my body as she
leaned in and put her mouth on the end of my cock. She sucked it
slowly and deliberately, her lips gliding wetly up and down over
the head while she tugged on the shaft with both hands. I reached
down and fondled her heavy boobs, squeezing and hefting them as
she moaned softly around my dick. I knew it wouldn't take long.
Nicole was sucking me harder, taking me deeper into her mouth.

"I'm close," I told her, feeling myself hovering on the edge. She
gave a few more quick sucks and then moved forward to trap my
straining cock between her tits. They were incredibly soft. I
groaned as she squeezed them firmly together with her hands, my
dick almost completely engulfed between them. Then she started
moving her boobs up and down, jacking me off with her tits. I
came almost immediately. The first spurt splashed weakly up
underneath her chin, but the second was much more powerful and
caught her squarely on the mouth as she looked down. She flinched
and raised up a bit, allowing the rest to shoot out onto her
chest and boobs. I hunched upward, shuddering as the pressure
faded and an intense feeling of release washed over me.

When I was finished, Nicole let go of my cock and sat back,
looking somewhat stunned by the force of my ejaculation. I
reached over and ran my thumb gently over her lips, wiping most
of the cum away before leaning down to kiss her deeply. She
moaned against my mouth and firmly returned it. At that moment my
feelings for her were the strongest they'd ever been. Not quite
love maybe, but something close to it. After a few moments I
pulled away and helped her to her feet.

"How about a shower?" I asked, unable to keep from grinning.

"Yeah," she said, an embarrassed smile appearing on her face. "I
think I need one after that."

After getting half-dressed we snuck out to the bathroom as
quietly as we could. We showered for a while together, neither of
us seeming to be in any hurry.

"Did you enjoy that?" She asked suddenly as she was soaping up my
back.

"Yes," I answered, not sure if she meant cumming on her tits or
the whole thing in general. "A lot."

"So did I." She didn't say anything else.

After we'd finished cleaning up, Nicole dressed and left. I saw
her out and was heading back to my room when Renee's door opened.
She shot me a sidelong glance as we walked past each other, a
smirk appearing on her face.

"That sure was a long goodbye," she commented, disappearing into
the bathroom.

I dropped down into my bed, trying to ignore the nagging
uncertainty which grew as my afterglow faded. Things with Nicole
were getting serious. The first time could have been a mistake.
The second time might have been an accident. But the third time
hadn't been either. The strange truth of it was that I'd
basically become fuck buddies with an engaged girl, and it was
one of the last situations I'd ever imagined myself being in. I
wasn't sure how to deal with it. The rational side of me wanted
to break it off before somebody got hurt. The lonely side wanted
to enjoy it for as long as possible. Somewhere in between was a
sense of resignation at the thought that a normal, guilt-free
romance seemed forever out of my reach.
