+-----------------------------------------------------+

Since we had proven we could be induced to take their 
younger sisters out, our older daughters felt that they 
need not be dateless.  There was some collusion between 
them and Nick sat down with me one evening not long after 
the Prom.

"Dad I need you to do me two favours please."

"Is it going to cost me?"

"One will be free and should be painless, the other might 
cost a little - how much is up to you - but it should be 
worth it."

"For whom?"

"For you, silly!"

"You want a favour that I have to spend money on yet it 
is to my benefit.  This should be interesting.  
Continue."

"Well first of all I need you to have a word to Richie."

"About what?"

"About asking me out.  He's nice; I sit home here, he 
sits home there.  I think he likes me enough to enjoy 
himself if we went somewhere, together, but I suspect he 
thinks he's too old.  From what I heard from Fiona, Ange 
didn't find him too old so I don't know why he'd think I 
was."

Ange?  Was I not alone in getting some special treatment 
that night?  And what of Prue and Howard?

"I think I can do that for you.  Is there anywhere in 
particular you'd like to go?"

She smiled.  Her mother used the same smile to make me 
compliant.  "I think I should make him work a little bit 
for my company, don't you?  Dinner somewhere nicer than 
Roscoe's would be okay."

"And your second request?"

"I want you to ask Fiona out on a date.  She thinks 
you're cute and funny - though I don't know why.  Only, 
when you do, could you please arrange a different venue 
from where Richie ends up taking me, or at least a 
different night?"

"When, not if?"

"You like her don't you?"

"Yes."

"A sexy young woman wants you and you think twice!  I 
know it's been a while Dad but you do still remember how 
to pedal, don't you?"

"Sweetheart, I didn't fall off my bike; it was taken away 
from me."

"Sorry Dad.  I wasn't thinking."

"It's alright Nick.  I still miss your mother but I 
remember the fun times we had together and with you and 
Prue.  I guess I have gotten a little lonely at times but 
I'm not sure Fiona is a replacement for her."

"I don't think Fiona sees herself as a replacement for 
anyone, nor would she want you to.  She could be 
appreciated for herself, don't you think?  Why not at 
least take her out and try an evening together and see 
how you get on?  You'll know soon enough if your ages are 
a problem and if they aren't and you enjoy each other's 
company you can do it again."

I didn't think how it might affect our Saturday nights if 
we didn't enjoy each other's company.

"And I suppose Fiona is talking to Howard about asking 
Cass out?"

"I never said you were a dummy, Dad."

---

We three men got together - though I had a quiet word to 
Prue first.

"Gentlemen, I think we need to lay our cards on the table 
so none of us feel guilty or, at least, guilty in 
isolation."

They looked at me.

"Okay, I kissed Prue goodnight after the dance."

"And I've no doubt Richie gave Ange just as much lip 
service as I gave and got from Shelley.  I think those 
three knew exactly what they wanted from us on the night 
and weren't about to take no for an answer.  I suggest we 
simply accept the fact, behave like gentlemen and refuse 
to kiss and tell and each hope our daughters behaved as 
responsibly as I'm sure we did ourselves."

Oh Howard!  A blush?

"And on to the second item of our agenda.  I'm sure you 
have both been encouraged to take someone out soon.  
Richie, Nick would appreciate it and I think I approve.  
I don't know how the town will react to us going out with 
much younger women but I suspect the other younger women 
won't see it as a problem though their parents might 
worry we are coming after their girls next.  Do either of 
you have an objection to me asking Fiona out or, as I'm 
sure has been mooted, Howard asking Cass?"

"How old is Cass, Rich?  20, 21?"

"Twenty-one."

"Hell, I'm twenty-seven years older than her.  That can't 
be right in anyone's book."

I grinned.  "Howard, I'm twenty seven years older than 
Shelley.  At least Cass is legally an adult."

"I don't have to get my shotgun out do I, Jerry?"

"I wouldn't get mine out if my adventures were all that 
happened to Prue."  I enjoyed Howard's squirming.

"Jerry,..."

I raised my hand.  "Howard, I'm just teasing you.  I've 
spoken to Prue - don't worry, she doesn't kiss and tell 
either, at least to me.  She had a night to remember and 
I suspect you were traumatised more than she was by 
anything that happened.  She's happy and has no regrets.  
I don't think I'd have been as comfortable if some young 
buck had taken her."

He nodded.  "Thanks."

Richie looked at us.  "You spoke to Prue, Jerry!?"

"Well we spoke at the dance when we were all getting the 
bump and grind out on the dance floor.  Talking 
reasonably to her got reasonable responses.  I wasn't 
prying as such nor was I critical of her activities once 
I got over my surprise that so many of their friends 
would rub up against us.  She admitted later that we had 
all been thanked for taking them.  I'm satisfied with 
that."

Richie might have been wondering if Shelley's delayed 
arrival home had been due to a thank you I was eager to 
keep hidden, hence my willingness to forgive and forget.  
If so, he didn't show it.

"I've been informed that Fiona enjoys mountain views so I 
thought I'd knock off early on Friday and take her to the 
Chalet for dinner while we watch the sun set over the 
forest and the town light up.  I've been told in no 
uncertain terms that my daughter would prefer I not sit 
down at a table next to her and I think Fiona might feel 
the same, Howard."

"When are you asking her?"

"I thought at dinner this Saturday.  Do you think six 
days notice is enough?"

"It should be.  If you were asking one of us it's about 
five too many; for the girls though?"

"Yeah.  I've booked already - I can cancel but Friday's 
and Saturday's are popular.  Oh, and Roscoe's apparently 
doesn't make the grade for a romantic date."

"Romantic?"

"Okay, I added that to stir you both up."

"I guess we'd better be ready to ask by the weekend as 
well then.  I don't see much point in saying I don't want 
to go out when I'd enjoy a quiet dinner with attractive 
company - romantic or not.  I know Fiona is going to make 
her own mind up about who she is going to date and I'd 
trust you to respect her and her feelings more than the 
morons around town."

"I'm glad you didn't say 'other morons' Howard, though I 
wonder if we're all old fools."

"Nah, Jerry.  Don't you remember?  We are all eligible 
bachelors!"

Howard and I had to laugh with Richie.

---

We didn't let on to any of the girls that we'd be 
inviting each other's older daughter out when we met at 
Howard's on Saturday night.

I noticed Fiona looking my way soon after we got there; 
she blushed when I smiled at her but before I could 
approach her individually, Shelley got me to one side and 
rewarded me again for taking her to the Prom.

"I see you have a bra on tonight at least."

"I can lose it if you want," she offered.

"No, I think that you'd best stay as you are."

"I couldn't believe that I'd sat there like that with 
you.  You're the first guy who's seen them.  I just lay 
in bed thinking of you when I got home.  Well, not just."

Too much information, young lady.  Next you'll be asking 
me whether I "just" thought of you and your milky white 
breasts.  If she did, I'd give myself away even with a 
"No comment."  A dishonest "No" would be just as poor at 
convincing her.

"One more kiss please and then I'll behave until it's 
time to go."

I sighed.  I wasn't being blackmailed and could have 
refused but really, no-one else was kissing me and I 
liked it.

Shelley followed the letter of the law as she had drafted 
it.  She behaved after the kiss but while she held me in 
place with her hand on the back of my neck her free hand 
groped me gently through my pants.  Of course, I reacted 
and not only underneath her fingers.

Shelley was suddenly kissing lips that were stretched 
tightly over teeth pressed firmly shut.  Out of the 
corner of my mouth came a garbled "Shelley! No!" which 
she understood and probably expected.

She released me before I could pull her away and wrapped 
that arm around me so she could rest her head against my 
chest.

"Think of me doing that and more when you look at me 
across the table tonight."

Definitely a minx!

If I hadn't been kissed by anyone else in a while, being 
fondled went back before my wife's death.

Shelley made it very hard to go back to where the others 
were roaming in and out to Howard's barbecue.  She 
deserted me for Prue and Ange so I downed a beer with 
Howard and resumed some semblance of calm before deciding 
to front my fears and speak to Fiona.

"May I have a minute please, Fiona."

Smirking, Cass and Nick left us alone.  I barely noticed 
Nick moving beside Richie while Cass stood between her 
and Howard effectively ensuring they would have to talk 
through, or else to, the girls.

"I won't try to pretend I don't know what you want to 
talk about if it's easier."

"Good.  It is always more reassuring if you're asking 
someone out to know that they won't shoot you down in 
flames for asking.  Now I've just got to convince you 
that dinner with an old fart won't be as bad as it 
sounds."

"I thought I was going with you!"

I bowed.

"If it is convenient and meets your approval, I've made 
reservations for 6:30 next Friday at the Chalet with a 
table overlooking the sunset and the City Lights."

"Both of them?"

"I thought I'd leave the porch light burning so there 
were three.  Perhaps we will get lucky and someone will 
drive through town so we can have a couple more white 
lights and then some red ones."

"Sounds nice but what time would we have to leave?"

"5:45 I'm afraid if you actually want to be seated for 
the sunset.  If that's not possible I can move dinner 
back and we can stop off at the lookout first."

"No.  That's okay.  I accept and thank you, Jerry.  You 
didn't have to you know."

"I know.  You ladies just made us get up off our butts.  
I suppose it's been too easy to just enjoy your company 
each week.  We should have to put some extra effort in 
from time to time.  God knows the three of you are worth 
it."

Fiona's eyes seemed to sparkle at my appreciation of them 
- and in particular, her.

---

We were finished the meat and salads and just leaning 
back - digesting, drinking and chatting until we felt 
there was room to fit some dessert in.  Nick asked the 
question that started a guerrilla war we were barely 
aware of initially.

"So Fiona, I understand you've been asked out - where are 
you going?"

"Up to the Chalet for dinner on Friday."

Ange was surprised her sister had found someone worthy of 
her attentions in town.  She knew Fiona's view on the 
local men; they coincided for the most part with her own.

"Who on Earth is taking you?"

"Oh a rather nice guy, sexy in an understated way, good 
sense of humour most of the time, polite and caring."

Ange laughed.  "Must be either married or passing through 
town."

Shelley, sitting roughly opposite me, noticed my reaction 
to Fiona's description.  I'm sure I didn't go as far as 
blushing but perhaps I looked down at my glass and played 
with it while a stupid grin spread from ear to ear.

Her "Erk!" went unnoticed by most of the table except for 
Prue. She turned to Shelley and then looked across at me.  
The penny dropped.

"Dad!"

Her voice wasn't loud; her enunciation though was clear 
and the disbelief was evident to all.

Ange turned, expressing disbelief and perhaps horror in 
her eyes.  "You're going out with Mr Stevens!?"

"Jerry has asked me nicely so, yes."

Cass looked at Ange.  "And your dad has asked me out 
Saturday since it's our off week and Nick is going out 
with my dad on Sunday."

The youngest three were quiet for much of the rest of the 
evening, picking at their dessert and leaving to talk in 
Ange's room while the remaining six continued to discuss 
the advantages of our particular dates.

The one question that Shelley asked before the youngest 
three departed from the table was, "But what about us?"

The comment that they were surely "old enough to take 
care of themselves" was ironic since their youth was the 
biggest problem they faced in trying to get us to take 
their advances seriously.  It also didn't address her 
intended meaning.

---

"Those bitches!"

"You want to go into Fiona's room and trash all her 
clothes so she has nothing to wear?  We'll help."

Shelley brightened.  "Thanks Ange but she'd probably just 
go naked."

"I think we need to get in first," Prue decided.  "We 
need to show them that it was more than just a kiss after 
taking us to the prom."

"Well that's true anyway - isn't it *MICHELLE*?"

"So?  You'd have done the same *ANGELA*, if you'd gotten 
the opportunity, and had the courage."

"And had the tits."

"Yeah, well these puppies are nice."  Shelley hefted them 
at Prue's comment.

"So how do we go about this?"

---

I was barely aware of the body beside me at first.  I was 
tired and had had enough to drink that I didn't have any 
trouble getting off to sleep.  Having someone next to me 
wasn't something recent but I'd shared a bed for so many 
years that I naturally spooned in behind Shelley's naked 
form without conscious effort.  My dreams were of my wife 
- loved and lost.  I guess my senses filled in the gaps 
between reality and memory and I held her to me.

There was no overt sexual contact.  Having placed herself 
at my mercy, Shelley behaved.  That might not have been 
her original intention but laying in my arms was nicer 
than she'd expected and doing anything more might wake 
me.  Waiting for more courage, or for me to start 
something, instead she joined me in sleep.

---

There was something wrong.  Your mind - and mine - cycles 
through deep and light sleep and is periodically alert 
without actually waking.  I remembered the erotic fantasy 
for only seconds.  It had been ages since a wet dream had 
actually ended in wetness.  That was an embarrassment 
more for pubescent boys and perhaps girls.

Being aware of something wrong doesn't make it obvious.  
My bedroom was a sanctuary of sorts.  I listened for 
external sounds.  The streets were quiet.  No distant 
sirens and certainly no squealing tyres - not in this 
town.

My next thought was my daughters.  They weren't screaming 
and there were no muffled thuds or hints of smoke.  Wendy 
was asleep beside me so she was okay.  I was about to 
grab my robe and check the house anyway when I realised 
Wendy was five years dead.

So, if not my wife...?

She was Prue's size but why would Prue come into my room.  
If something had troubled her she would have woken me and 
talked it through.  I turned the light on and saw 
Shelley's hair.  Lifting the covers I had my next fear 
realised.  I dropped them back down to conceal a 
delicious spine leading to a spankable butt.

I reached under my sheets and was relieved to find no 
traces of dried sperm or matted hair.  I doubted that I'd 
had enough to drink that I wouldn't have woken during sex 
but there was always that doubt.

I turned the light off and crept from the room.  My 
obvious concern was - if Shelley was here, was she the 
only one?  The doors were secured at night so someone had 
to have let her in and given the proximity of the houses 
I knew before I opened Prue's door that her bed would be 
empty.

The girls had placed us in an extremely difficult 
position.  Going to the Prom had been unusual but 
socially acceptable.  Having a young girlfriend - as in 
taking Fiona out - would have been cause for gossip.  
Having sex with a seventeen year old if we were over 
twenty one would in this state be cause for incarceration 
and a sex offender tag.  Just having her naked in my bed 
would be prima facie evidence for the gossips in town 
even if the authorities felt no need to proceed.

I decided a heads up was needed in the other households 
before I woke Shelley.  I rang Howard's house and hung up 
after three rings.  Enough to wake him without causing 
the rest of the house to stir out of bed.  I repeated the 
same trick at Richie's.  I could imagine both of them 
going "Oh shit!" right now.

It might seem that I had a lot of faith in the two of 
them doing the right thing - especially when my own 
daughter was involved.  I had been friends with them both 
for years and knew we were on the same wavelength about 
most things.  I didn't doubt they could take advantage of 
the situation but knew they wouldn't be taking advantage 
of the girls.  The age of consent laws were there to 
protect the innocent from unscrupulous adults, 
opportunistic teens, and themselves.  I suspected we men 
were the ones in need of protection.

I sat down next to Shelley after pulling my pants on 
beneath my robe.  I shook her shoulder.

"Mmm?  Oh! Hi."

"Shelley are you awake enough to tell me what your 
feelings are for me?"

I guess she expected anything but that.

"I like you.  I like you a lot.  I'd like to be with you, 
like this, like last night - in your arms.

An awful lot of "like"!

"Have I done anything you'd like to see me go to prison 
for?"

"What?  No.  Never!"  She went to sit up but I put my 
hand on her shoulder and kept her down, and covered.

"Would you please tell me then why you are in my bed?  
You realise I would get into serious trouble if you were 
found here?"

"But I'm almost 18!  Others are doing all sorts of things 
and they're okay."

"Nearly, not actually.  As for the others, I bet the boys 
are 17 or 18 too.  For them you only have to be 16.  For 
me it is a different matter.  I get sent to jail for 
anything from 5 to 20 years and if I survive that I then 
face being driven from one town to the next as a sex 
offender."

"I'm sorry.  I didn't mean any of that to happen.  I 
thought I only had to be sixteen.  Please believe me."

"I do.  Don't worry."

"I'll tell them nothing happened."

"If you do as I say that won't be necessary.  It's too 
soon to get you home so I want you to go to Prue's room 
and finish the night there.  I'll get some of her clothes 
and I want you to put them on ready for first light."

"Won't people see us when it's light?"

"They'll take less notice then than if they see us 
roaming between houses at three in the morning."

"Okay."

Again I had to stop her getting out of bed.  "I'll get 
Prue's tracksuit.  Wait there and get your underwear on."

I was sure Prue was going to have a fit that I had been 
searching through her drawers for something for Shelley 
but she was to blame for the necessity.  Anyone watching 
had to see Prue leaving, not Shelley.

I found what I wanted and returned to my own room.

"Come in," quietly greeted my knock.

I guess I should have told Shelley to get back under the 
covers once she had bra and knickers on.  Too late now 
and she wore much the same when swimming.

"Here, put these on please and I'll see you about six."

"I am sorry."

I held her, kissing the top of her head.  "It is a pity 
you aren't 18.  I would have enjoyed waking up with you 
beside me."

Shelly looked up at me, her face full of delight now.  I 
got a brief kiss.

"See you in the morning, Jerry."

She gathered her own clothing and tiptoed out.  I sat 
down only minutes before I got an SMS from Howard.

"U2?"

I SMSed Richie "WAIT4CALL" and rang Howard back.

"Put her in Ange's room and I'll be over around dawn to 
set things right."

"Okay - we'll have to talk though."

"Agreed."

I did the same with Richie and settled back into my now 
regrettably empty bed.  There was a touch of lingering 
scent on the pillow Shelley had used and I swapped it 
with mine.  By six I was exhausted.

I waited until it was light and then knocked quietly on 
Prue's door.  Shelly opened it and looked at me in my 
tracksuit.  She seemed to have had as little sleep as me.

"Leave your clothes here - Prue can return them later.  
And pull your hood up."

"Can I say I'm sorry again?"

"I think there will be ample opportunity for all three of 
you to consider how sorry you are.  Here's Prue's 
runners, will they fit?"

"Probably a little loose."  Shelley hadn't worn footwear 
on her trip over here.

"They'll do.  Okay then, come on."

We left without any attempt to hide.  Prue and I were 
simply going over to Richie's house.  I'd messaged him to 
warn we were on the way and I didn't need to knock.  He 
glared at Shelley.

"Go and give Prue's clothes to Ange and send her out," I 
instructed.  "You can take her clothes back later."

"If you're not grounded for life!"

Shelley slid past her annoyed father.

While we had a second alone we shared a grin.  "Pity 
things are how they are.  I liked having a warm body next 
to me."

I couldn't have said that to Richie but I could 
acknowledge his sentiment.

"Prue" and I continued to Howard's place where he too was 
waiting.

"Swap clothes and send her out please."

Howard shook his head.  "Do we meet first and then talk 
to them?"

"Do you think there is much to discuss that can't include 
them?  It might help if they understand what we went 
through to decide on a punishment."

"Hmm.  True if we agree.  What if we have different 
ideas?"

"We can get their opinions."

"I meant if we don't favour punishment."

"That is as valid an option as any others."

"Okay.  I'll go along with that.  Where?"

"The Sports Ground.  It should be empty until the church 
services are over about ten.  How about we meet at 8:30?"

"I won't be going back to bed and I'm sure Ange will only 
stew until then so it's half a punishment by itself."

We heard Prue coming.

"Sorry Daddy."

"We'll talk but for now we're going for a jog.  Come on."

---

Prue's wasn't the only long face as we met at one of the 
picnic tables by the local Sports Ground.  There were a 
couple of dog owners and some legitimate joggers but 
people turned up here for lunch, not breakfast.

"Morning everyone.  I guess I can't exactly say 'good' 
can I?  I know Shelley and Prue are aware of the possible 
consequences of their actions.  Do we need to cover them 
for Ange?"  I looked between Richie, Howard and Ange.

"Angela understands."

Ange cringed at the use of her full name - and all that 
implied.

"Have you two heard why your daughters decided to go 
sleepwalking?"

There were some smiles at my euphemism but not everyone 
felt humour was appropriate.

"It seems they got jealous because their big sisters got 
dates and they didn't."

"Dates with you three," protested Shelley.

"Why is that so important?" asked her father.

"Because.  We like you.  We know how you behave towards 
us.  We respect you."

"We love you," added Prue.

To say we were stunned would have been an understatement.
