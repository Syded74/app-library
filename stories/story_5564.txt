This story is set in the fictional "Reatcher World" http://www.asstr.org/files/Authors/doppelganger/reatcher_world.txt. Read it to understand why the described events would be possible.

There has been an increasing amount of peaceful demonstrations, mainly by young people that demand a change. For the last demonstration, the government decides it has to crush the feeling some people begin to have that they can freely protest, and sends the order to the police to use unrestrained violence against the “unlawful demonstrators”.
 
---------------------------

One police agent drives the riot control armoured vehicle, while another one in the rear side. From there, by means of a joystick and a high definition screen which allows zooming and precise aiming, a front turret on top of the vehicle can be controlled. This joystick-controlled turret has two cannons:

- High pressure water cannon. 1 cm diameter high-pressure stream of water. Could cause severe injuries at short distance.
- Cannon of gas adherent grenades. This is a novel weapon. It consists of balls of 4cm diameter, made of hard plastic with holes, from which an gas that irritates eyes and throat is expelled after the firing. In addition, the plastic surface of the balls have very small, short and twisted metal hooks, like sturdy metal velcro. When the projectile impacts on any type of cloth, it becomes attached. The metal velcro is so sturdy that the projectile can only be removed by ripping off the cloth, and if the cloth is strong, a target subject with average strength will have no other option than taking it off. In any of both cases, the target subject will probably be affected by the gas. The projectile is launched at a lower speed than others, as the main objective is not the trauma, but that it becomes attached to any cloth where makes impact. However, can produce bruises under thick clothes, and when impacting on thin clothes or bare skin, the metal hooks produce additional skin damage.

There is also another rear turret to which one of the agents can climb and from which he can fire manual weapons towards the sides and to the rear of the vehicle. The manual weapons that the anti-riot agents have are: 
- Gun with .45 (11mm diameter) plastic bullets. Designed to cause non-permanent damage in extremities when fired at 40 metres.
- Bean bag shotgun. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_bag_round). A shotgun-like weapon that fires a cloth pouch with about 40 grams of lead shot that at 20 metres delivers the equivalent to a punch by a professional boxer.

In addition, if the agents have to leave the vehicle, they can take voltage-adjustable taser guns, and 50cm nightsticks, made of thick steel with 2mm hard rubber coating. The agents wear a dark uniform made of thin cotton, so it is comfortable in summer, but it is equipped with high-technology polymer protection plates in ankles, chest and back. They wear steel-reinforced boots and a lightweight helmet.
