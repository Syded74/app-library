There will be a strong sex slave/domination theme. I will keep this from violating any cannon established in the world and I developed the mythology that drives this story.

Azuliana  Uth Jungle

Fury beat in my heart as my son's blood dripped over my breasts. The arrow to his throat... He was dying. He couldn't survive that. The rage I had feared all my life, I embrace. I was Azuliana, the last living dragon.

I transformed.

The golden collar around my neck and the chastity belt around my waist did nothing to stop me now. I didn't care about the pain of the material squeezing around me. My body expanded into my true form. I tore through the metal restraints like they were nothing and roared as my neck grew longer. My head changed. My skin became azure scales. Wings sprouted from my shoulders.

The jungle shook with my fury as I grew to my full size. My tail swished behind me. Steam burst from my nostrils and around my sharp teeth. I whipped my head around in the direction that the damned arrow came from.

I breathed.

Clouds of scalding steam erupted from my mouth and struck the jungle with violent force. I ripped plants apart while everything living in there was parboiled. Plants ruptured as the liquids in them boiled in an instant. Animals fell dead from where they clung to the trees. Birds. Monkeys. Insects. 

My head swiveled from side to side, killing everything I could. That bitch would not escape my wrath. That cunt of an amazon would howl as she broiled from the inside. I would feast on her flesh. Devour her soft organs. Rip the flesh from her bones and suck the marrow from their innards. 
 MY SON WAS DEAD! 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Antagony

Pain burst across my arm as I fled the steam. A blast of it struck me, scalding my flesh. I reddened and blistered as I ran as fast as I could. Wood burst behind me. A mighty tree groaned and crashed to the jungle, destroyed by the fierceness of her breath.

I rolled into a depression, panting. I clutched my bow to me, forcing myself to slow my breathing. To be still and blend into the ground. I knew she was a dragon, but... I had never seen one in the flesh. She always seemed so gentle. A mother not a monster.

Stories of Azuliana's cousin, Dominari flashed through my mind. The creature who had burned a whole swath of the Princedom, creating the desolation. She had burned entire cities in her rage. I believed it now. If Azuliana wasn't unique, her fire element mixed with water, she would have created a forest fire that would have consumed all of the Uth Jungle.

WHERE ARE YOU! she roared. 

A mighty wind swept through the jungle. The tree I hid behind swayed. The sound of the mighty flap of leathery wings filled the air. A shadow passed over me. Azuliana soared above. Steam burst from her mouth and engulfed the jungle a dozen feet away. She bathed a tall tree. 

A colony of monkeys dropped dead from the trees along with dozens of birds, lizards, and even a small, spotted jungle cat. She flapped on, bathing more of the forest with her breath. A trunk burst in the middle and fell over with a burst of branches. Shriveled leaves and blossoms rained through the air.

Henta's piercing arrow, I breathed, my heart racing.

But this was what I needed. Chaos. The chaos to steal Diane. My prize was so close. It was time to redeem my bloodline for my mother's weakness. I rolled over onto my hands and knees and peered out at the chaos of Kurtis's party. 
They rushed to him as he bled out. I spotted Diane, her hands clapped over her mouth. I smiled. 
My moon maiden. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ziryihm

Oh, no, I gasped. I thought the golden collar on Azuliana's throat was to keep her from rampaging.

I had to stop this.

I spread my wings wide, letting my glow erupt from my body. The dragon breathed steam through the jungle, killing indiscriminately. Hisses and shouts rose from the ziggurat. It would be chaos in moments. I had to get her away from here. I had to protect her.

She was precious. The last dragon. The last of her tribe. Matar birthed five races of hermaphrodites. I couldn't let one of them go extinct. I broke out of the trees. Azuliana soared ahead of me, bathing the jungle.

Was Antagony dead? I hoped she was not, but it was her plan to wound Kurtis to create her distraction. Wound him... She must have killed him. No one could survive a wound like that. Not without healing magic.

And Kurtis had recruited a large band, but he had no mage. No priestess.

Azuliana! I cried and soared after my friend. You have to stop! You can't

The dragon banked around and soared straight at me. She had fury in her eyes. Murder in her claws. My heart skipped a beat. This was bad. Really, really bad. Such rage burned in her azure eyes. Her jaws snapped for me.

I dodged to the right. Azuliana!

Her claws slashed at me as she flew past. My wings flapped hard, pulling me clear before they ripped my belly open. She tried to kill me. Fear clenched about my heart. I had never seen Azuliana like this. She was the gentlest of all the dragons, but now...

She turned as she soared out over the Ziggurat. She was turning to kill me. Fear washed through me. What had I done? I told her she had to stay where she was safe. Back on her island. Her refugee. The world would kill her.

To prove my point, arrows hurtled up into the air from the ziggurat. The lizardmen unleashed a volley. Hundreds of them struck her, ripping through the thin membrane of her wings and bouncing off her armored scales.

Azuliana roared in mindless rage. She was berserk. Consumed by the angry fire that cursed her race. She banked down and dove on the ziggurat. More arrows leaped up at her as she breathed, engulfing lizardmen in her boiling steam. 

I glanced down at her dying son. I warned her. Fear clenched in my belly. That was an army of fanatical lizardmen. She wasn't Dominari. Azuliana could not take on an army by herself. She would die. 

I had failed so completely. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Azuliana

The arrows slammed into my body.

I snarled in rage. They thought they could hurt me! Arrows! Those disgusting missiles! Did they kill my son? Did those foul, disgusting, runty little lizards running around that mountain of bones put one of their arrows through my son's throat?

My scalding breath swept over the ziggurat. The hisses of pain rose into the air. I loved the sound they made. The way they died. I glanced back to see their bodies, their scales cooked red. Steam rose from the bones as they fell down it.

More arrows flew at me while at the top of the ziggurat, a rakshasa watched. She sat there, staring at me. I snarled as her disgusting minions shot more arrows at me. They bounced off my scales. They struck my belly and throat. One stuck in my horn.

I dove again and breathed.

My steam swept over them. They would all die for murdering my son. I broiled them alive. I swooped low, feeling the hot mist spilling over my body. I reveled in the moisture spilling over my body. I killed them.

I would feast on them.

I would gorge on their flesh. Then I would come for the rakshasa watching me. I would devour her last. She was the one responsible for hurting Kurtis. I exhaled another blast of steam, scalding a dozen lizardmen and some of those foul lizardwomen.

The scaly harlots died with their males. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pyrriah

No, no, no, I gasped, dropping to my knees beside my brother. Mother's furious roars shook the air. Wind whipped over me as she beat her wings. Please, no!

I reached for the arrow thrusting out of his throat. He gurgled, his body spasming. So much blood poured out of him. A crimson puddle spread from him. Shouts echoed around me. Others were crying out. I gripped the wooden shaft.

No, Mistress! Lilica gasped. The succubus grabbed my wrist. Don't rip it out. He'll bleed out even faster.

Then how can we save him? I asked, so desperate to keep my brother from dying. Please! Tears burned in my eyes. I missed the Phoenix so much. I needed the stoicism she had. She was brave. He wasn't supposed to die young! We saved him from that fate! No, no, this can't be happening.

He's so pale, whispered my sister. Lasla stood on the other side of him, her hands clasped before her. She stared at him. He's as white as the moon.

Mother's roars echoed through the air. The hiss of steam screamed everywhere. I stared at my sister. I didn't know what to do. Nor did she. 

No! snarled Nephi. I glanced at the sphinx as she jumped into the air, propelled by her wings. She crashed into a raptor. One of those disgusting dinosaurs. The pair crashed and fell to the ground in a thrash of claws.

Princess Naryu leaped onto another raptor that raced up the slope at us. She landed on its back and bit into the neck. Pradu came to her aid, grabbing the raptor's right leg and tearing into the thigh. They tore at the scaly hide to bring it down.

What did it matter with my brother down? He was bleeding out right now.

Adazza swung a club, breaking a raptor's neck. Stalker jumped at another raptor. A hold pack of them were attacking us. His tentacles wrapped around the beast, tripping it up. They fell into the brush as I just knelt here. Useless.

A mighty bellow shook the jungle. That wasn't Mother. She was breathing on the Bone Mountain now, murdering the lizardmen firing arrows at her. They rained down into the jungle that shook as a... tyrannosaurs rushed up the slope at us. It had a barbed collar around its throat that dangled part of a rusty chain from it.

Diane screamed in fright.

Tears spilled down my cheeks. What could I do? The cherubic faces of my Kurilia and Verilia, the twin daughters I had with my brother, flashed in my mind. Would I ever see them again? Them and my nieces and half-sisters. 

Don't be useless, Pyrriah, a voice shouted at me. Almost an echo of something else. You're not useless.

But I felt it. I wasn't the Phoenix any longer. I was just... a woman. A Daughter of Las, and lust wasn't going to save us this time. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lasla

Diane's scream made me jump. I wrenched my gaze from my brother wheezing out his final breaths. Diane didn't shout out of fright of the approaching tyrannosaurus but because someone had grabbed her and lifted her up. A kidnapper hauled the kicking moon maiden off into the brush.

Antagony.

I caught sight of that damned amazon who attacked us twice now. Back that night when we found the moon maiden and again with those nixie pirates she recruited. It was her arrow. She killed my brother and caused this chaos so she could kidnap Diane.

That bitch, hissed from me, my hands balling into fists.

Stalker roared in pain. Nephi snarled. The rakshasas growled. Nazak grappled with a raptor that was trying to tear his face off while the tyrannosaurus came closer and closer. Antagony thought she could get away.

I was a Daughter of Las, and she was just a dry cunt. I could do something with that. I might not be able to fight, but I could make a bitch pant for cock or quim. I threw out every ounce of lust I had in me at Antagony.

My desire crashed into a brick wall.

I snarled, remembering how she had that strange... protection around her. She couldn't be penetrated by lust. She was... warded somehow. I had met stubborn women. Women with iron wills or such powerful personalities, their lusts were gripped tightly, but this was different.
She had warded herself against desire.

I would break through it.

Let her go! I shouted and darted after Diane. I couldn't save my brother, but I could save one of his women. I would do that much. I would make the cunt who murdered him into a pleasure-madden slut. A useless pile of gibbering flesh that just craved endless bliss.

And I would deny it to her until every last day of her miserable life.

NOW! I howled as I rushed into the jungle. 

Steam spilled around me. The ground was hot, the air broiling. Burst plants littered the ground. Branches still crashed from above along with the animals Mother Azuliana killed. With Diane kicking and thrashing, Antagony couldn't go fast enough.

I caught up with them. The amazon shifted her grip and held Diane by the throat. With her other hand, she drew a knife. Delight shone in the amazon's eyes as she faced me. Bright red coated one of her arms. She had been hurt.

Not that she showed it.

You think you can force me, Spawn of Las, she spat, such anger in her eyes. It was more than fury with her. There was disgust. Revulsion.

She despised my father.

I didn't care.

I lunged forward, shouting, I'll make you into my pussy-licking bitch! Let her go!

Antagony drew back the knife to slice at me, but Diane acted. The moon maiden slammed her elbow into the amazon's stomach. It didn't do much, but it threw off her slash. I grabbed at Antagony's burned wrist and squeezed.

She hissed in pain and slammed her forehead into mine. 

I gasped at the sharp crack of pain. Lights flashed across my vision. I stumbled back and caught my balance. Antagony grinned at me, holding up the knife as she backed away. I glared at her, my heart breaking.

I won't let you take her! I cried, my vision blurring with tears. I won't let you get away with killing him!

Antagony smiled. Looks like I get to kill another Spawn of Las.

She flicked her wrist. Her dagger flashed at me. I gasped, frozen by surprise as something blurred across my vision. A loud crack echoed. The knife spun off to the side and stabbed into the vegetation. Beliala dropped down before me and flicked her whip now at Antagony.

Make her howl! I snarled, my blood boiling with rage. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Antagony

The whip cracked for my face. I cursed and shoved Diane to the side and threw myself onto my back. The demon's whip snapped above my head. If that hit me, agony would consume me. I knew that much. I kicked back up and flung another knife at the demon.

She twisted out of the way.

As she dodged my attack, I lunged for Diane. I grabbed the moon maiden's arm before she could get away. I would use her as a shield. I pulled her back for me when something darted around from behind the tree.

The lamia bit the back of my calf. Her sharp teeth tore into my flesh. The exhilaration of the hunt muted the pain. I drew my third dagger and slashed at the little bitch. I cut her across the face. The lamia hissed in pain, falling back from the blood spilling from her cut-open cheek.

Master! she yowled as she crashed into the grass. He set me free!

The demon's whip cracked at me. I let go of Diane again to jump away. I rolled and drew my sword now. I had to fight. There was no escaping this bitch. I held my leaf-bladed sword before me and faced the demon.

Her red eyes burned as she slashed her black whip at me. 

I darted to the right, studying her. She cracked at me again. She was fast, but... I dodged left and readied to act, shifting my weight onto my heels. She wound up for her next strike. She committed. I dove forward and rolled beneath the whip. 

CRACK!

The sound echoed over my head as I came up in a crouch and slashed my blade. I cut open her belly. She gasped at me in shock as her entrails spilled out. She caught her ropy innards with one hand as she staggered back in shock.

I'm a demigoddess, too, I hissed in delight. 

My gaze flicked to Diane. She stared in horror at the wounded demon, her eyes so wide as she witnessed the creature about to collapse. I darted to her and seized her by the wrist. I yanked her to me. She gasped and stumbled into me.

What did you do? she asked, tears in her eyes. I'm not worth this. No one is worth such suffering.

You are worth so much, I told her. You're priceless. More than that brute who stole you from me. Now come on! Stop resisting, or I'll kill more of your friends.

Horror crossed her face. Her lower lip quivered before she nodded, the fight leaving her. She cared so much for them. That would make her compliant. She was weak like my mother. I wasn't. I was strong. I would prove it.

Everyone would know my blood wasn't soiled by him.

I yanked hard on her and marched away. The lamia whimpered on the ground, a hand pressed over her bleeding cheek. She hissed at me as I passed. I just smiled, my sword held low. I had her. Nothing could stop me.

Brush crashed behind me. I rolled my eyes and turned to find Lasla charging at me.

Stop! she cried like I would obey her. Lust slammed into me and washed over my protection. She thought the filthy power she inherited from Las would make me weak in the knees?

Foolish child. I raised my sword to cut her down. I would eat to see her lying dead on the ground like her brother. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lasla

She raised the sword to cut me down. I gasped in fright. Murder shone in her eyes. My lust splashed harmlessly on her. Death shone in the edge of the sword. She really meant to murder me, and there was nothing I could do.

At least I would join my brother in the Astral Realm.

Wings hummed. Antagony shot her gaze up. Oberoy flew soared over and threw glittering fairy dust down on the amazon. She gasped, raising her sword to ward it, but that did nothing. It burst into a cloud around her and she swayed.

What? she asked, her sword slipping from her fingers. You... flying... rat... 

I smiled. Oberoy was always lurking on the edges. Watching. Waiting. Now he acted.

Rip off those... wings off... Antagony fought to keep her eyes closed, but it was a losing battle against the fairy's magic. Not... fair... You... cheated...

And shooting my brother in the throat from the bushes isn't cheating? Isn't being a coward, Antagony? I smirked at her.

She glared at me, but...

Henta's... Antagony collapsed to the ground, releasing Diane. The moon maiden stumbled to the right, also hit with the dust. She collapsed into a cute pile on the ground, her hair spilling over her face and breasts as she lay there asleep.

Now, Lilica! Oberoy shouted as he flew for Beliala. The demon snarled in pain as she leaned against the tree, holding in her innards. Oberoy landed by her, reaching out to touch her then pulling back his hand.

Lilica ran up. The succubus became a cloud of pink vapor and flowed over the sleeping amazon. She invaded her dream. Was this my chance? I dropped to my knees and grabbed Antagony's hand. I squeezed and I thrust my lust into her.

She still had her barrier up, but it was weaker. Ephemeral. It was the sort of self-control I felt around my brother. It was like she was a Daughter of... Las. My eyes widened. A smile spread on my lips as I realized I held another half-sister's hand.

My lust penetrated her barrier. Lilica seized it. I felt the succubus pulling me into the amazon's dream. I didn't resist. I would make this slut into my bitch. I fell into the dream, eager to make my brother's killer into my favorite pussy pleaser.

I would destroy my half-sister with lust. She would become my slave, ruined by pleasure. Destroyed by rapture. Just a drooling mess. I thought of my brother and plunged into his murderer's soul to avenge him.

This was how a Daughter of Las inflicted vengeance. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pyrriah

The raptors hissed as they fought with the others. Stalker ripped open the belly of one, tearing out blue, ropy innards. But beyond him came the tyrannosaurus. My brother was dying, and a massive lizard standing as tall as the trees approached.

He bellowed.

Mother didn't care. She was consumed by rage and grief. She killed the lizardmen, lizardwomen, and the rakshasa slaves that clustered around the Bone Mountain. The Skull Tigress just watched from the pinnacle of her cruelty and suffering as the slavering monster climbed the slope to devour my brother and me.

Please, I whispered. I glanced down at him. I didn't want my brother to die. I held his hand. He still lived.

A branch rustled above. I barely heard it over the thudding footsteps. A dark shape appeared. I gasped at the bast landed over him. The black-skinned catwoman glanced at me, her feline eyes full of concern. I gaped at her. Where had she come from?

What are you doing here? I gasped as she planted her pussy on his face. 

She grabbed the arrow and ripped it out of his neck. He groaned and spasmed. His blood spurted against her leg. I had to follow him. This male... I'll save him. Just buy me time.

I glanced back at the tyrannosaurus. He was almost on us. I trembled and turned around, my heart pounding in my chest. What could I do? Its terrible, slitted eyes were aimed right at me. It hungered to tear me apart in a single gulping bite.

Nazak appeared and threw his bloody club. It struck the tyrannosaurus in the jaw. A chip shattered. The beast snarled and fixed its gaze down on the lizardman. Nazak stood tall and resolute, the only barrier between us and the tyrannosaurus.

The beast's jaw snapped down. Nazak tried to dodge out of the way. The teeth snapped down on his left arm. With a savage jerk and horrendous pop, the tyrannosaurus ripped the lizardman's arm off and gulped it down.

Blood spurted from the wound. The lizardman staggered, hissing at the pain. The tyrannosaurus tilted back his head to finish swallowing the limb. My heart pounded in fear. We were so dead. Bast continued grinding on his face, healing him, but what did it matter?

Such hopeless despair fell on me.

No, no, I had to do something. Be strong. The Phoenix wouldn't give up.

I didn't have her any longer, but...

She was just a part of me. She influenced me, but it was still my courage. My boldness. I was still the one that had to go into danger. She gave me the skills to fight, the fire to burn, but I was the one that needed the will to use them.

I had the will, but what could I do?

Nephi leaped at the tyrannosaurus's leg. She grabbed the flesh and tore into the muscle. She ripped free a chunk of bloody flesh. The tyrannosaurus kicked out its leg to the side and flung her off. She struck a tree trunk and bounced off, lying on the ground.

The big dinosaur inhaled, nostrils flaring. It growled and leaned its head down toward... us. It smelled my brother's blood, and it was still hungry. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Azuliana

MURDER MY SON!

I circled the Mountain of Bone, bathing the macabre ziggurat in my steam. I boiled a group of feral rakshasa with hideous scars across their chests from where their breasts had once been. They died chained in place. I didn't care.

They all were responsible.

They all murdered my son.

Arrows struck my belly. A group of lizardmen down by the trees drew back their bows. My steam engulfed them. I savored their hisses as they paid for what they did. The searing mist spilled through the foliage, killing more hiding in the brush. 

Something landed on my back and tried to bite my neck. 

I turned my head to see one of the mutilated rakshasas clinging to me, her chain broken. Others were being set free and leaping from the ziggurat's terraces. Many missed and crashed into the side of the Mountain of Bone, snapping limbs and tumbling dead to the bottom.

I snapped my jaws at the one on my back and tasted her blood. Her bones snapped in my jaws. She roared in pain before going limp. I spat her out into a group of lizardmen drawing bows. She crushed one and knocked the others off-balanced.

I glanced back at the throne. The Skull Tigress had stood. She bent her legs. I roared my challenge. She would never make it. Let her try and die. That would be amusing. She flung herself off the top of her Mountain of Bones in a high arc.

She soared up into the air and came down on my back. I was shocked she made it. Let her. Rakhasas didn't have the strength to bite through my flesh. She could stay there while I killed the rest of her servants.

She would be the last to die. Now I didn't have to hunt her down.

A dragon, she hissed, her voice savage and purring at the same time. How... exhilarating.

I breathed steam on another group of her servants racing up the ziggurat to get better shots on me. They spilled out of the mist in limp heaps, their scales reddened. The warmth of my attacks rose around me, allowing me to soar with ease.

Yes, yes, this is an interesting day, the Skull Tigress purred. It's been so long since I've seen such carnage.

She bit at my wing shoulder. I expected her teeth to slide over my scales, but they tore through me with ease. Pain exploded as she savaged my flight muscles. The ligaments that kept my wing out. She ripped out my flesh as I lurched to the side. My left wing faltered.

I snarled as I lost lift and banked over to the left, hurtling for the jungle trees. I thrust out my front legs and closed my eyes as I crashed into the jungle trees. Branches burst over my body. I struck a trunk, thrown to the side.

The Skull Tigress roared in laughter as I slammed into the jungle floor in a burst of detritus. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pyrriah

The tyrannosaurus opened his jaws to eat us. I was the only one that could protect my brother. I just had to buy a little bit of time for Bast to heal him. Her throaty purrs echoed as she brought she soaked her in her healing pussy juices.

I rose to my feet and thrust out my hands. I had to be strong. I had to be as powerful as possible. I focused on it and swelled with power. I caught the jaws, gripping it in my hands. I slid back a few feet as my body brimmed with...

Strength.

It was like when I thought I threw that rock at the other tyrannosaurus with more power. I had tapped into something in me. Something I didn't know I had. I had changed. Transformed. I now possessed swarthy skin. A brownish-yellow hue. I was taller. Bigger. Stronger. I stared down at my flesh. I had become... an orc. I had changed shape like Mother could. I had made my body strong enough to catch the tyrannosaurus's bite.

The creature snarled, snapping its jaws shut as I strained to keep it back. I was strong as an orc, but I could become stronger. I could become... my true form. Phoenix hadn't suppressed me being a hermaphrodite. 

She had suppressed me from being a dragon.

Las had fucked a dragon. Of course, I would be one, too. Lasla was probably really a sylph like her mother, and my brother was... something special. Not a dragon, but with a dragon's strength of personality. The fire had transformed in his lusts, stronger than mine or my sister's.

I roared as I swelled into a dragon. My neck grew long, my body covered in blue scales that matched my hair color. The world shrank. No, I expanded. I stood face to face with the tyrannosaurus. Eye to eye with a monster.

I was a monster, too. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kurtis

The flavor of spicy pussy juices dragged me out of the darkness.

I had fallen into an abyss. A cold place that I never thought I would escape, but that aroma drew me back. The taste suffused my mouth. I groaned and opened my eyes to see a black ass clenching before me. Bast's ass.

Bast's pussy juices.

The pain in my neck faded as I heard a roar. I blinked to see a dragon looming over us. Her tail swept back and forth. Lasla must have unleashed Mother. She was grappling with a tyrannosaurus. The two snapped at each other.

Only... were those scales a slightly darker shade of blue. And... there was a difference in the horns. I'll admit that I hadn't seen my mother in her dragon form in years, but... That wasn't her. That was someone else. Someone who... I knew.

Pyrriah, I groaned into Bast's cunt.

My sister was a dragon. It all made so much sense. We just thought she was a generic hermaphrodite, but that wasn't what she was at all. Las had made a dragon with Mother. Of course. I licked Bast's pussy. The pain faded.

Help the others, I growled. I knew that there had to be others who were wounded. We must have been ambushed by the Skull Tigress's forest. The air resounded with snarls and hisses. Steam drifted through the jungle. There was such devastation around me. Please, Bast.

Mmm, you are too remarkable of a male to be denied, Bast said, her tail swishing over me. she rose from me. Stay alive.

You, too, I said and rose to my feet, my cock hard.

I ignored that and drew my sword. My entire chest and shoulder were soaked in blood. I ignored it as I watched my sister. She bit savagely into the tyrannosaurus's throat. The massive dinosaur roared in pain only for it to become a wheezing snarl. Her mouth came away, severing the windpipe.

She had the beast under control so I looked around. Nazak leaned against the tree, clutching at the stump of his left arm. Nephi twitched in the bushes. The three rakshasas and Stalker were tousling with raptors, wounds dripping blood across all their bodies.

The tyrannosaurus stumbled to the side and collapsed into a heap. Its leg kicked. I sucked in a deep breath, glad that the monster was dead. I moved up to my sister and stared out at the Bone Mountain, looking for more threats.

It was half-concealed by mist. No, steam. Mother was bathing the lizardmen with her breath. She had gone berserk like she always feared. I swallowed at the devastation she caused with her scalding attack. Then something leaped on her. A rakshasa. Mother suddenly spasmed and banked to the left.

Gods damn! I gasped as Mother crashed into the trees on the far side of the Bone Mountain. She struck one, snapping it in half. It fell with her as she hit the ground. Pyrriah.

I saw it, she growled, her voice distorted but it was still her. What could bring down Mother?

My hand clenched into fists. The Skull Tigress. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Azuliana

The Skull Tigress ripped into my back. Her claws tore through my scales. I snarled in pain as she savaged me. How was she so strong? I twisted my head around and focuses on the bitch ripping out a chunk of my flesh and chewing it.

YOU KILLED HIM! I roared.

My head snapped for her to crush her between my jaws. She grabbed me, stopping me from slamming my fangs down around her slender body. She growled with delight as she strained against me. Why was she so insanely strong?

With a growl, she shoved so hard, my jaw exploded in pain.

She ripped the tendons in my mouth as she let go. My lower jaw hung loosely, broken and damaged. Pain shot through me. She purred in delight as I thrashed in agony. I rolled over to crush her. She leaped clear as I came up over me.

Oh, yes, I have never eaten a dragon before, she said. Your skull will mount the top of my mountain.

I roared in wordless rage. I breathed steam. It burst out of my broken jaw. She leaped forward in a blur. She bit into the back of my foreleg's knee. She ripped through the tendons. Such agony screamed through me. I nearly lost my balance.

Mmm, I am going to enjoy devouring you, dragon.

I snarled in helpless fury as she ripped the hamstring from my other leg. I collapsed on my belly. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kurtis

I scrambled onto my sister's back, grabbing one of her dorsal fins running along her spine. I pulled myself up on her. Mother roared in pain. She collapsed, thrashing. The Skull Tigress savaged her. Overpowered her. The foul lizardmen and lizardwomen moved in around Mother, watching her snarl in pain.

Go! I called to my twin.

She leaped off the slope and spread her wings wide, flying for the first time. The wind whipped past my face. It had been months since I flew on the back of Mother when we left our island behind and journeyed to the mainland for the first time on the quest.

What we needed was in that disgusting ziggurat. We just had to defeat that monstrous bitch hurting our mother.

No! Pyrriah cried as she dove down the slope. A group of lizardmen was raising bows at her. They had lizardwomen and what looked like rakshasa slaves mixed in them. My sister breathed, but it wasn't steam that poured out.

It was lust.

Lust distilled into a blue vapor that poured over the lizardmen. It was like I had reached into all their souls at once and inflamed their passions to the maximum. All those engulfed by the aphrodisiac mist grew hard cocks or wet pussies. They leaped on each other.

The lizardmen drove their two dicks into both of the lizardwomen's pussy. Or they rammed a cock each into a rakshasa's pussy and asshole. They fucked beneath us, their lust rising up and sweeping over us. I couldn't believe how powerful it is.

My sister roared in delight as she soared across the battlefield. She bathed more of the survivors in the aerosolized lust. She left orgies in her wake as she closed in on our mother. I gripped my sword in my hand, sucking in deep breaths. 

I was ready for the fight to come. 

Pyrriah dove down on our mother, the Skull Tigress on her back and tearing at her flesh, ripping off chunks of her scales. Pyrriah lowered her head, her horns thrusting out over her eyes. She meant to gore the Skull Tigress.

Pyrriah landed over our mother and slammed her horns into the Skull Tigress's back.

The rakshasa monster flew forward and slammed into the trunk of a tree. She bounced off with a bone-breaking impact. If the goring horns didn't kill her, then that impact with the tree would have finished her off.

Still...

I leaped off my sister's back and held my sword in hand. My mother whimpered as she lay in pain on the ground. I advanced on the limp body of the Skull Tigress, my sword ready to cut her down if she so much as twitched.

Kurtis, my horns didn't penetrate her body. It was like striking a brick wall! Pyrriah cried.

What? My stomach lurched.

The Skull Tigress leaped at me, snarling. Her green, feline eyes brimmed with cruelty that surpassed even the Empress of Shizhuth. I slashed my blade and struck her in the head. She still impacted me and threw me off my feet.

I landed on my back and rolled. I scrambled up to see her on all fours. My sword didn't even cut through her face. She had no blood matting her striped fur where I struck her. She didn't even have any damages to her whiskers.

She lunged at me before I could stand.

Pyrriah snapped her jaws down over my head. The Skull Tigress backhanded my twin, snapping the dragon's head to the side. I came up and swung at her. She caught my sword on her forearm. It bounced off. 

She leaped at me again. I blocked with my sword. The impact nearly snapped my arm. I gritted my teeth against the pain. It should have broken my arm. I stumbled back, fighting to keep my balance. I stepped on my other's limp wing and caught myself.

I should not have taken that blow. Only I felt stronger than normal. Invigorated by... Bast's pussy juices. She had flooded me with her cunt cream, pouring so much healing energy to mend my mortal wound in minutes, she overfilled me with her power.

Her blessing.

The Skull Tigress leaped low at me. She kicked at how she ducked my sword strike. She swept my feet out from beneath me. I gasped as I fell onto my back. I crashed down hard, grunting at the impact. It nearly knocked the wind from my lungs.

She pounced on me. I rolled to the side. She kicked me. I gasped as I flew into a tree trunk and bounced off. I landed on my hands and knees. I struggled to my feet, but she lunged in so fast. She blurred. 

I raised my sword.

She bit it, her teeth scraping on metal. She jerked back her head, almost wrenching my weapon from my hand. I barely kept a grip on it, but my palm was sweaty. She gave another hard yank, the handle slipping in my grip.

CRACK!

Beliala's shadowy whip struck the Skull Tigress across the back. The demon landed a moment later, a smile on her lips, her red eyes shining with delight. The Skull Tigress should have dropped to the ground.

She laughed, a purring delight. I stared in horror at this creature. What could we do to the ancient rakshasa to harm her? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pyrriah

Beliala crashed her whip against the Skull Tigress. The rakshasa didn't even try to dodge. She just turned around and allowed the blow to crash across her big and firm breasts. She was supposed to be a thousand or more years old, but... She had smooth skin. No blemishes. No sign of age to her at all.

She looked as young and supple as me.

What was she?

It didn't matter. The Skull Tigress laughed as Beliala snarled in frustration and slapped the whip across both those big tits. They hardly jiggled from the impact. I moved slowly. The Skull Tigress wasn't paying attention to me or my brother.

I snapped my jaws down on her. I crashed my jaws around her body. I squeezed down on her as hard as I could. My teeth hurt. They almost snapped. I couldn't believe that she had skin that strong. This was so insane. 

Her fingers shot out for my eye as I crushed down as hard as I could on her. She plunged it into my eye socket. Half the world grew back as intense pain exploded down my optical nerve. She plucked out my eye and hissed in delight. She popped it into her mouth. 

Her laughter echoed as my head snapped back. I recoiled from the pain, snarling in rage. What could we do to defeat her? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kurtis

You sick bitch, I snarled and swung my sword at her.

I struck her in the back. I hit her hard. The Skull Tigress stumbled forward a few feet and turned to face me. She licked me, her big tits swaying. Mother whimpered in pain behind her. Pyrriah snarled, blood weeping from her wound.

Sick, she said. I am... free. This is my domain. I own everything that trespasses. I own her eye. Her flesh. The marrow in her bones.

Her hand shot out and grabbed me by the throat. She squeezed.

And I own you. 

She lifted me off the ground, her fingernails biting into my flesh. Her tongue slathered pink over her furred muzzle. Hunger brimmed in her green, slanted eyes. She wanted to feast on me. I swung my sword at her, slamming into the side of her face.

The Skull Tigress laughed. 

I hacked at her head, my sword slamming into her skull. The blade bent from the impact. All I did was ruffle her fur. She squeezed harder on me, slowly crushing my breath. I could still breathe. She could choke me to death.

But she was having fun.

I sank my lust into her and...

Recoiled.

I had never felt anything that vile before. That sick and depraved. She only craved pain unlike anything I had felt. I had flashes of her cutting off the beasts of her own daughters. Raping them with daggers. Spiked dildos. Tearing them apart. She flensed her victims, peeling off strips of skin to eat. She kept them alive as long as possible.

She built the Bone Mountain victim after victim. Hundreds of thousands over millennia. She was the foulest thing alive. She took such joy in this. In my sister's pain. Mother's agony. In my helplessness.

She choked harder.

Lord Kurtis! Beliala shouted and grabbed the rakshasa by the throat, choking her. 

The Skull Tigress snapped her head back into the demon in a crunching impact. The demon staggered back two steps and collapsed, her head split open. Blood poured down her skull. The rakshasas smiled.

Such devoted servants. I think I'll crucify you to this tree and let you watch me slowly kill them one by one. Her rough tongue licked my cheek. How does that sound, Lord Kurtis.

I slammed my knee into her stomach.

I might as well hit a rock.

I kicked between her legs, punting her pussy. Nothing could harm her. What was she? How had she become like this? She had it. The artifact that Throwia wanted. The most devout servant to the Goddess of Cruelty had what she needed.

I would laugh if I wasn't about to die.

To be continued...
