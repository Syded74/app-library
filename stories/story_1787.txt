<b><font size=+2>On the second
shift of the second full day Gwendoline and Harriet were working together,
the guard with the spanking fetish turned up on duty.&nbsp; Gwen was quite
pleased to see him, as Harry had told her all about him!&nbsp; Although
she had never sought for this kind of experience since her marathon session
with Mrs Travers (a lady Gwen had met several times since, but on a purely
social basis!)&nbsp; she still had a slight hankering - an involuntary
spanking from this fellow held no terrors for her -&nbsp; quite the reverse!&nbsp;
It was clear to Gwen, however,&nbsp; that Harriet was hating it.&nbsp;
Every time the strap descended on her reddening bottom,&nbsp; Harry's face
registered both pain and an angry loathing in equal measure.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwendoline decided that something really should be
done about it - but what?</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Her chance came when the pair and their supervisor
were directed to a remote part of the facility, where they were all temporalily
out of sight&nbsp; of anyone else.&nbsp; As the noise of the leather once
again rang out its crisp staccato crack, this time on Gwendoline's rather
appreciative hindquarters,&nbsp; Gwen's leg shot out and her dusty and
hardened foot caught the nuisance right in his face, sending him sprawling,
losing his grip on his gun as well as the strap.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwendoline swept up both gun and strap with one hand
and helped the man to his feet with the other.&nbsp; She returned his weapons
to him and then addressed him, hoping he understood at least some English.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You'd hate your colleagues to know you let a mere
woman do that to you!&nbsp; I won't say anything, if you don't.&nbsp; And
please leave my friend's bottom alone in future.&nbsp; You're more than
welcome to do what ever you damned well like to mine"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The startled man grinned broadly at this.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You are a brave young woman - my God you are!&nbsp;
My mother is like you - she's scared of nothing and nobody.&nbsp; Let's
get back to work, shall we, girls!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>He backed up this request with a mighty blow of his
restored strap to Gwendoline's bottom, a blow which caused her to squeal
with delight.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>....................................................................................................................................................................</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+2>At night, the two discussed the events of the day.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You took one hell of a risk&nbsp; there, Gwen.&nbsp;
But thanks all the same!&nbsp; I was getting so fucking bloody pissed off
with that guy!&nbsp; It seems the pair of you&nbsp; have got something
mutually satisfying going for you, in your respective twisted ways!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"It takes my mind off the boring nature of the work,
my sweet.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so much nicer than that session they gave me
on the first day"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"That must have been utterly horrible, Gwen!&nbsp;
They gave me half an hour in there after I last made a run for it.&nbsp;
My throat was raw from screaming for days after.&nbsp; I didn't hear you
scream, though.&nbsp; I can't quite make up my mind if that's because you're
so very much braver than me,&nbsp; or because you rather enjoyed it."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"It was an interesting new experience, Harry.&nbsp;
It is always good for me to explore the furthest limits of my endurance,&nbsp;
so that I can find out just how much I can take and know a little more
about myself.&nbsp; In that sense I welcomed the hours I spent with those
very inventive, original and dedicated people!&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I don't
want to go back there for a while, except possibly&nbsp; to kill them all!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>................................................................................................................................................</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Next day the guard with the strap was absent.&nbsp;
He was nowhere to be seen the day after that either,&nbsp; and Gwen asked
the&nbsp; fellow charged for the time being with keeping an eye on them,
where the other guard was.&nbsp; The man thus addressed motioned Gwen to
stand against a post with her arms over her head.&nbsp; He then proceeded
to use his strap on her, starting at her shoulders and working his way
methodically down to her bottom.&nbsp; When he had finished he told her
to get back to work. As she took up her spade, she turned to the man again.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Now that you've half killed me, perhaps you'd like
to answer my question."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>He made as if to resume his brutal treatment, but turned
away, muttering,</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Gone back home.&nbsp; Mother very sick"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Thanks.&nbsp; I do so hope she gets well" said Gwen,&nbsp;
and resumed working.&nbsp; She walked a little stiffly for the rest of
the day but was otherwise none the worse.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>...........................................................................................................................</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I hope you think that information worth the rather
high price you paid to get it!" said Harriet that night as she examined
Gwen's bruises.&nbsp; You really do stick your neck out!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"All knowledge is power, Harry.&nbsp; It may come in
useful."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>.....................................................................................................................</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Two days later the guard returned.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
she was sure no one else was looking, Gwendoline asked after his mother.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>He replied that she had died.&nbsp; Gwen placed her
hand on his arm in a gesture of sympathy and then stood on tiptoe and kissed
his cheek, telling him that she had lost her father a couple of years ago
and understood something of his grief.&nbsp; She then resumed working by
Harriet's side and for the rest of his morning shift neither girl's rear
felt the stinging kiss of his strap, much to Gwen's regret!</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>When he came back&nbsp; on duty for the final afternoon
shift,&nbsp; he was still abstaining from his usual lambasting of Gwen's
by this time leather-hungry buttocks and she asked him why.&nbsp; He said
he was sorry for what his friend had done to her the other day and did
not want to hurt her again, especially as she had been so kind to him.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You'd better return to hitting my friends bottom,
then!" she replied to Harry's amazed horror.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Back in their cage, with another sore bottom,&nbsp;
she rounded furiously on Gwen, asking what the fucking bloody hell she
thought she was doing!</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"If he looks to be going easy on us, his superiors
might think him guilty of fraternising with us and going soft and he'd
be in trouble and we'd lose him.&nbsp; Let's face it Harry, he doesn't
hit you all that hard&nbsp; - he just likes the way our arse cheeks wobble
like jellies and go red when he slaps us - and we NEVER have our two-hourly
drink refused by him OR get worked&nbsp; half to&nbsp; fucking death like
with some of the others.&nbsp; Just grin and bear it until he comes back
to slapping me again.&nbsp; Any way it'll only be a few more days now."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"How can you be so sure of that, Gwen.&nbsp; You've
done nothing to get us out of here - all you've done is annoy one of the
guards and get yourself beaten up.&nbsp; We'll never get out.&nbsp; You
shouldn't have come - what's the use of both of us getting killed?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I'd sooner be here with you, my darling Harriet, than
anywhere else in the world.&nbsp; As for the both&nbsp; of us being killed
- I wouldn't want to live any more if anything happened to you."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"What about Jim and your little boy, Gwendoline?&nbsp;
You must get back home for their sakes - don't&nbsp; forget that!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"We'd better both survive then!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Gwen - if you know something I don't, for heaven's
sake tell me.&nbsp; Don't you think I've a right to know?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwen looked at her friend and shook her head.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"What if they took you to that ghastly room, Harry.&nbsp;
You'd be telling them everything they wanted to know within minutes.&nbsp;
Just trust me and be patient.&nbsp; Jomo says there is a festival in a
couple of days, when they will all be celebrating something or other.&nbsp;
He will be going home to his mother's funeral.&nbsp; I'm glad he's going
to be out ....."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>&nbsp;"You were saying, Gwen?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Nothing, Harry.&nbsp; I said fucking nothing!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harriet flushed angrily at this.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I won't tell them anything if they torture me, if
that's what you're so scared of.&nbsp; I might scream the place down, but
I'd say nothing.&nbsp; I swear it, Gwen!&nbsp; I swear it!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwen looked uncertainly at her friend for some moments
and then,</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"With any luck, Jessica and the others should have
got to a telephone by then and when they speak to your friend Mr Mboyo,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Government will hit this place with everything they've got - they'll
have to, because it will be their one and only chance.&nbsp; Just don't
look excited, Harry.&nbsp; Act just the same as usual!&nbsp; If the rebels
suspect anything we're both going to suffer for it."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Why didn't you all bring a radio with you, Gwen?&nbsp;
We could have been out of here by now"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Not if the rebels had picked up our signal, we wouldn't.&nbsp;
I'm not totally fucking stupid, Harriet - which is as well for the two
of us, since you obviously are - too much sun over the past couple of years!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Well, Gwen - Here's something I bet you never thought
of.&nbsp; When these bastards have one of their festivals they let us partake
of it as well.&nbsp; We get to be staked out in the sun all day and night
with nothing to eat and only a cupful of water at just before dawn and
another just after sunset.&nbsp; It's not a fucking picnic, I can tell
you."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I know what they'll do to us, Harry!&nbsp; Our guide
spoke to a sweet old man who tried to give you a drink on a previous such
occasion and got a rifle butt in the face for his pains.&nbsp; Don't you
see Harry we'll be out in the open and not cooped up in here when things
start to happen.&nbsp; And I bet we're strong enough to pull one of those
stakes out of the ground.&nbsp; Just look at this fabulous collection of
muscles we've built up between us!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You don't understand Gwen.&nbsp; The only thing to
do in order to stay alive is to be still - conserve your strength and don't
get dehydrated.&nbsp; If you try struggling to get free, you won't last
out the day"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I do so wish you would try to be a bit more positive,&nbsp;
Harriet.&nbsp; You are a real disappointment to me sometimes!"</font></b>
