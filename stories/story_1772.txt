<b><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+4>Katie Part
6</font></font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">Katie O'Brien&nbsp; had finished her first
assignment after her return to work, following her bizarre and very uncomfortable
kidnapping in Central Asia.&nbsp; She had been sent to cover a meeting
of industrialists in a south coast resort. It was now Saturday and Katie
had decided to delay her return home, booking a couple more nights at the
hotel now mercifully bereft of journalists and financiers.&nbsp; After
all the compulsory socialising of the past few days she badly wanted time
alone .</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">Heading out of the hotel, she decided to make
for the coastal path leading up into rolling green hills.&nbsp; It took
her only a minute or two to realise she was overdressed, even though it
was early November and the temperature was in the mid to high forties.&nbsp;
Back to her room and off with the heavy coat.&nbsp; On with a sleeveless
top which came down only to three inches above her navel, leaving a vast
expanse of her trim, athlete's stomach bare to the wind. Off with her jeans
and on with a tiny pair of very short shorts.&nbsp; On with a stout pair
of shoes.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"Gosh, that's better" She had been stifled
for the past few days, stuck inside the conference room by day and forced
to socialize in boozy, smoke filled bars by night, dressed in a business
suit.&nbsp; "Lets blow a few of those cobwebs away"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">She was soon out of the town and climbing a
steep flight of steps up into the country park, finding herself walking
over the springy downland turf, her hair streaming behind her in the breeze
and feeling all her cares and worries falling away from her.&nbsp; She
felt a million zlotys.&nbsp;&nbsp; An elderly couple passed her, going
the other way and turned gazing open-mouthed at this reckless young woman
as she strode energetically off into the distance.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"Mad as a hatter, that one - makes you feel
cold just looking at her"&nbsp; The worthy old couple were not to know
that this young woman had endured weeks of exposure to far worse than this
and had come almost to enjoy a bit of hardship, pushing her body up to
and beyond its furthest limits, testing herself almost to destruction.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">Soon she came to yet more steps, which led
down to a valley and up the other side was a steeper flight of steps.&nbsp;
She ran all the way up and arrived at the top only a little out of breath
and sweating.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"This is the life", she thought and continued
running along the gentle upward slope of the coastal path. Despite the
autumnal mist, she could just make out the sea below.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">Another steep downward slope with flights of
steps cut ino the pathway and she was at another valley and saw a notice
announcing the way to a beach.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"Let's have a look at this isolated beach,"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">Twenty yards along the path was another notice
"Nudists May be Using this Beach - Warning"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"Not at this time of year, they won't" thought
Katie.&nbsp; "Even I would think twice about it&nbsp; - wouldn't I ???"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">The path terminated at a wooden staircase leading
precipitously down to the beach. It was a slightly hairy journey for the
elderly and inactive, but Katie scampered light-footedly down and soon
found herself on a shingle, rocky beach.&nbsp; She climbed up and over
a few of the rocks and found herself looking down at lovely deep water
beneath her.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"No, I couldn't. I'd be mad,&nbsp; I'd be stupid,
It'd be suicidal - I'd freeze in seconds- stiff as aboard - and I've no
towel. Don't be so f*cking stupid.&nbsp; Have a bit of sense, girl - Oh&nbsp;
it's no good - you're not listening are you?"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">Her clothes neatly folded and&nbsp;&nbsp; lying
on the rock beside her she jumped feet first into the sea.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">Not even the high pressure hosing down of icy
water that the nasty policewoman had directed at her were like the sensation
she experienced today&nbsp; as she sank under the water and surfaced, gasping
with pain.&nbsp; Every tormented nerve-ending on every square millimetre
of skin was crying out for mercy.&nbsp; But Katie was not in a merciful
mood!</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">&nbsp;She thought, "Better swim ashore before
I die of cold"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">So why was she swimming out to sea - daft bitch?</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">She paused and trod water, looking at the distant
shoreline. "If I don't start back now, I'll never make it"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"So why am I swimming even further out.&nbsp;
Cause I'm f*cking crazy, that's why."</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">For twenty minutes she swam gently along parallel
with the shore and at long last made for the beach using her fastest stroke
and cleaving cleanly through the water.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">The sharp pebbles caused her feet as much agony
as the water had caused her skin, as she emerged finally and reluctantly
from the icy cold water and made her way&nbsp; towards the distant rock,
behind which she had left her clothes.&nbsp; She forced herslf to walk
at her normal punishing pace, grinding her feet into the shingle and ignoring
the pain.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"Why did I not swim back to the place I started?&nbsp;
Silly stupid question!&nbsp; Because&nbsp; I want to prolong this little
adventure, that's why.&nbsp; I don't want&nbsp; to wear clothes or feel
warm and cosy ever again. I want to stay here all winter, just like this
and greet the nudists when they arrive in the Spring. I'll chuck my clothes
into sea and let the tide take them Heaven knows where. I don't want them
any more!&nbsp; I hate clothes!"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">By the time she reached the rock she was beginning
to shiver uncontrollably and the crazy instinct which had ben driving her
to her to the point of lunacy was waning fast.&nbsp; She was so perished
that she couldn't wait for even the minimal warmth her scant clothing would
provide her.</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">"Just behind that rock there", she thought,shivering
more and more. "Let's get dressed and back to the hotel"</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#663300">End of episode</font></b><b><font color="#663300"></font></b>
<p><b><i><font color="#FF0000">Are Katies clothes still where she left
them?&nbsp; Has the villainous Charlie Ford tracked our hapless heroine
to this lonely spot and made away with them? Will she freeze to death on
a deserted beach in the cold November? Is she doomed?</font></i></b><b><i><font color="#FF0000"></font></i></b>
<p><b><i><font color="#FF0000">Maybe I'll let you know sometime.</font></i></b>
