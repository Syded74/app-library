<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter 1: Under the Table</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aaron was over at James and Mandy's
house playing a collectible card game.  James was notorious for
taking a long time with his turns, so Mandy was in the kitchen doing
a few things.  She poked her head into the dining room to discover
that her husband was still planning out his turn.  "Are you going
to do anything?" she asked.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Frowning, James said, "Yeah, I guess
so."  Mandy came back into the room, but it was still a full minute
before James announced a massive attack on his wife's forces.  Then
he played two special cards which all but guaranteed a lopsided
victory on his part.  "Aaron, would the House of Crane like to
share in the glory of this attack?"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Uh...ugh...ahh..."</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"So what kind of support will you
provide?"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aaron's eyes were glazed over, and his
cards were laying face down on the table.  He made no move to pick
them up either.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Honey, I don't think he was agreeing
to help your attack."  Mandy informed her husband.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Sure he was.  He said un-huh."</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mandy had a sly look on her face.  "I'm
pretty sure that's not what's going on here."  She pushed her chair
back from the table to take a look at was happening under the table.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing his wife giggle, James pushed
his chair back to see for himself.  His stepdaughter, Samantha was on
her knees under the table.  Aaron's hands were tangled in her long
blond hair and her head was bobbing up and down in Aaron's lap. 
"Damn it Samantha!  How many times have I told you not to do stuff
like that with Aaron while we're in the middle of a game?"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pulling her head off Aaron's cock
caused him to sigh.  "Aw, your turns take forever Papi!  I was just
trying to keep Aaron from getting bored."</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well quit it!"  James scolded.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Samantha defended her actions, "You'd
have never known I was up to anything at all with Aaron if Mom hadn't
gotten impatient and prodded you to get on with the game."</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, I did get on with the game."
 James said irritably.  "So are you helping with the attack Aaron?"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Separating a card from his hand, Aaron
said, "The honorable House of Crane feels that it is a time for
peace, not battle."  Before he could play his card, Aaron groaned. 
"Oh Samantha!  That feels so good!"  His hands disappeared back
under the table, and he was obviously guiding the teen's head up and
down his hard shaft.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Samantha!"  James protested again.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Don't make her stop!"  Aaron
pleaded.  "Mandy, your daughter is so skilled with her tongue! 
Just flip that card over."</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hmm, Imperial Peace Talks"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Damn it!  That one cancels the whole
combat phase, doesn't it?"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Yeah, and it gives Aaron a boost to
his honor rating,"  Mandy added.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aaron was now oblivious to the card
game, lost to the pleasure of the blow job Samantha was giving him. 
James tried for several minutes to come up with something else he
could accomplish on his turn, but he had invested everything into an
attack that could not happen.  It was only when Aaron shouted,
"You're about to get a mouthful of gooey white stuff girl!"  That
James ended his turn and Mandy started hers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aaron's position had been poor, and now
James was in a difficult spot too after losing the benefit of some
powerful cards to Aaron's distracted, but effective play.  Mandy put
her husband out of the game while Samantha crawled out from under the
table.  When her mother turned her attention to Aaron's forces, she
told her daughter, "Honey, you missed a spot," while indicating
the corner of her mouth</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Samantha giggled and wiped up the
errant jizz with one of her fingers.  Then she put her finger in her
mouth and declared, "Yummy!"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mandy's second attack wiped Aaron out
of the game.  He put up a valiant defense, but her forces turned out
to be just too strong.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Aaron, why didn't you help my
attack?  You basically handed Mandy the game!"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aaron flipped up a few of his cards. 
Both led to large gains in honor when played.  "I knew I wasn't
going to win with brute force this game.  I needed the honor from
hosting peace talks more than I needed to disrupt your attack.  I
didn't realize how strong Mandy's position had become.  I thought I
would be able to prevent total annihilation for one turn, and then I
could play these and claim an honor victory."  Aaron added,
"Besides, it's hard to feel too upset about losing with what
Samantha was doing to me under the table."</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Samantha grinned as she settled down
into Aaron's lap.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I can't believe my plans were foiled
by a guy getting head from my stepdaughter," James complained. 
Samantha stuck out her tongue at her stepfather.  "Hey, don't you
stick your tongue out at me!"</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"It's my skilled tongue!"  Samantha
corrected.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Even more reason for me to not want
it pointed in my direction."</P>
