                               Sangrelysia

                          by Vivian Darkbloom

Return

   Above, light whiffs of thin clouds here and there punctuated the
   deep balmy blue of the spring sky. All around, the unfurling
   bright green freshness of emerging leaves and blossoms.

   "I am the cool breeze across the battlefield," whispered a quiet
   voice in my mind's ear. As the crowd stood tensely riveted to the
   adjacent crashing noise, my concentration drifted to memories of
   all the seasons I had witnessed in this amphitheatre.

   The year before, an itinerant company of players had put on an
   exhaustingly complete musical rendition of the entire
   Maha-Bharata, and I had found myself in attendance for the entire
   5-night series. The pyrotechnics alone were spectacular -- even I
   learned a few tricks.

   In a few short moments, the dramatic summary of the Vedic ages
   flashed across my mind, the braided cycles of the yugas, while
   somewhere in my senses I could hear the mysterious crashing
   continue. Feet stood on the rough-hewn precambrian stone slabs of
   the stage, feet clad in sandals, army boots, dressy fine pumps,
   or simply bare, met the sturdy surface of hoary chunks of rock,
   on tiptoes, necks craning.

   Something was distorting my sense of time.

   For another brief instant my concentration slipped, and I could
   see the dais stones in all of their different ages, the layers
   peeling away like the thin filo-dough in baklava, the stones in
   all their ages and seasons providing support for dramatic
   productions in generations past and future, the long-ago days
   when they were first quarried and brought to this place, to back
   when the molten liquid of the Earth surface first heaved them
   forth to cool and solidify.

   Looking over to where Elwrong crouched, head down, I could sense
   the emanation of terrible darkness, her reaching for the lost
   connection through the complex labyrinth of space and time.

   "They're back!" someone cried joyfully.

   Snapping out of my reverie, I looked up to see King Hieronymus
   and Queen Megan riding over the crest of the hill on horseback.

   "Mom! Dad!" shouted Sylvia.

   "What the devil is going on here?" roared the king.

   A chorus of cheers was rising from our followers on the other
   side of the hill.

   "And," he demanded, riding brusquely down through the hastily
   parting crowd to where we stood, "What in blazes does this filthy
   maggot think he's doing, wearing my crown?"

   "Well, I um," stuttered George, "You were gone, y'see, and the
   people needed a strong leader, some who could guide them through
   these times of darkness. . ."

   "I remember you," said King Hieronymus. "You're the imposter who
   was claiming to be some relative of mine. Faked up forgeries of
   documents and all. And what's this piece of trash?"

   He lifted a corner of the ridiculous mockery George had made of
   the Sangrelysian banner.

   "The new flag," beamed George proudly. "I made a few
   improvements. You like it?"

   Hieronymus examined it for a moment, then reaching out a
   powerful, gloved hand to hold the flagpole, tore it slowly from
   its post. Then he began stretching it from the edges, until it
   split down the middle with a huge ripping sound.

   He held up the two pieces and lit a match beneath them, waiting
   until they were engulfed in flame to let them fall to the ground,
   where George's obsequious followers were forced to stamp out the
   flame so it wouldn't spread.

   "Now, that was fun. Any more questions?" asked the King politely.

   "Daddy, where have you been?" wailed Sylvia.

   "Just out riding in the woods, sweet. We weren't gone but a few
   hours. . ."

   "But Daddy, it's been a year now!"

   Hieronymus met my gaze with inquiring eyes. "Supernatural
   forces?"

   Chagrin clutched at my heart. "Yes. Looks like you were caught in
   some sort of spell, which I failed to prevent. We've got some
   catching up to do."

   As usual, he read my emotions with unerring accuracy. "Stop
   feeling guilty," he growled purringly. "Everyone makes mistakes."

   A spiraling tendril of a shadow curved outward from where Elwrong
   crouched in anguished dread of her past deeds, of the horrors of
   war she had designed. Briefly, a savage grin of triumph flashed
   across her face.

   "She's getting away!" shouted Sylvia, "Opening another portal!
   Stop her!"

   "No," said Clarissa calmly, sadly, "She's not."

   "Stop!" I shouted, "Before it's too late! We can help you!"

   Elwrong's leering grin turned to an expression of sheer terror,
   as the spiral of darkness came slashing inward like a propeller
   spinning up for takeoff.

   "No!" she yelped, simply, before the vortex of shadows closed in
   around her, and gradually she shrunk into the paradoxical
   infinite distance of perpetual everpresent tenebrosity, whisked
   away by the lurking gloom always concealed beneath the luminosity
   of the visible world, growing smaller and smaller, farther and
   farther away as the web of grim occlusion funneled in like a
   liquid going down a drain, in four or five dimensions right there
   before us.

   Until only a tiny pinpoint remained, like the inverted final
   period of an old-fashioned switched-off TV set or oscilloscope.
   But a point of blackness so intense that, as I looked into it I
   felt as if I were on the edge of the world, peering over the rim
   into a fathomless chaos of eternal night, into the unfashioned
   realms of darkness.

   Then like a soap bubble, it popped, leaving behind only the
   ordinary flagstone surface of the stage, well-weathered and worn
   by countless thespian escapades.

   "What just happened?" asked the King.

   "Caught in a temporal undertow," I said. "She was trying to
   escape."

   "Is she still alive?"

   I shrugged helplessly. "Nobody can say for certain. It's like
   vanishing beyond the event horizon of a black hole. Nobody has
   ever worked out the math well enough to satisfactorily explain
   what's going on."

   "And nobody has ever returned to tell us about it," concluded
   Clarissa quietly.

                                                          Chapter 29
