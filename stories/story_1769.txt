<b>Part 6</b><b></b>
<p><b>Professors Arnold Potts-Johnson, Joachim von Hatzendorff and Hiram
P Hackenbacker from England, Austria and the United States respectively,&nbsp;
were nearing the end of their allotted task of drawing up the agenda for
the forthcoming Anthropological Congress to be held in a couple of weeks
time at University College, London.&nbsp; Most of the work was complete
and it only remained to arrange the field trip.&nbsp; Part of the purpose
of the forthcoming Congress was to study&nbsp; vestigial ancient customs
in the developed world, England in particular, since this was the country
favoured with the task of hosting this year's event.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Professor Hackenbacker spoke in his rich baritone voice.</b><b></b>
<p><b>"I hear that there is an ancient fair held each year in a place called
Little Sprodwell.&nbsp; This is a festivity which has roots going far back
into the pagan and pre Celtic past of this country where each year is re-enacted
an ancient pagan sacrifice of a young maiden as an&nbsp; appeasement of&nbsp;
the fertility gods."</b><b></b>
<p><b>"Bollocks!" said Professor Potts-Johnson in his reedy and querulous
tones.&nbsp; "And the full name of that one-horse arse hole of the universe
is Little Sprodwell under Fosse - God help us all!"</b><b></b>
<p><b>"I beg your pardon, Professor, but I have this on the very best authority.&nbsp;
The trouble with you locals is you can't see the wood for the trees.&nbsp;
You are blind to the treasures to be found in your own back yard."</b><b></b>
<p><b>"Bollocks, if you will permit the repetition, Professor!&nbsp; This
particular shindig is as phoney and ersatz as it comes.&nbsp; Believe me,
I know!&nbsp; The presiding genius is a relative of mine - the black sheep
of the family and a total charlatan to boot!&nbsp; But, what the Hell?&nbsp;
It'll be a nice day out and a goodly display of female flesh can be practically
guaranteed if I know anything of the Colonel, the old lecher!"</b><b></b>
<p><b>Professors Johnson and Hackenbacker looked at their silent Teutonic
colleague.&nbsp; This learned and weary Viennese gentleman shrugged his
acquiescence - the first indication on his part for some time that he was
actually awake.&nbsp; A visit to the Fete by a coach load of learned anthropologists
from the four corners of the globe was duly pencilled in.&nbsp; The three
then happily adjourned to the Lamb public house in Lamb's Conduit Street,
Holborn.</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Mr.&nbsp; Harry Fenton-Jones, travel agent, entrepreneur and sometime
jailbird was finalising the arrangements for a party of visitors from various
parts of the New World.&nbsp; He had five Australians, three new Zealanders,
four Canadians and twenty Americans to take care of for a week as they
visited the land of their ancestors and breathed in the atmosphere of Olde
England - or so they fondly believed.&nbsp; The usual weary round of visits
to the Tower of London and Shakespeare's Birthplace and all that old hat
had been arranged, but there was still the Saturday to take care of.&nbsp;
Once again, he read the letter from his Aunt Jenkinson in Little Sprodwell.</b><b></b>
<p><b>He spoke to his associate,&nbsp; a Mr. Lemmy Goldberg.</b><b></b>
<p><b>"Auntie says they have arranged some kind of re-enactment of a virgin
sacrifice this year.&nbsp; Just an excuse to bare a bit of flesh of course.&nbsp;
Apparently it won't be quite as proposed, alas!&nbsp; They were going to
tie this absolutely gorgeous and bare-arsed naked honey - a really exceptionally&nbsp;
lovely chick, by all accounts,&nbsp; down to a kind of pagan altar with
her legs spread out so all could get a good look at her merchandise, but
the lady refused point blank in extremely emphatic and even more extremely
unladylike terms.&nbsp; They've still got something pretty good lined up
for her, though, even if she doesn't actually know it yet, poor bitch!&nbsp;
Promises to be even more of a sleaze-fest than usual."</b><b></b>
<p><b>"Whatever you say,&nbsp; my boy!" replied his genial associate.</b><b></b>
<p><b>"Well, I vote we put this on the itinerary again.&nbsp; Hell's Bells!&nbsp;
They've successfully sold it to a party of so-called learned anthropologists
as being the real McCoy!&nbsp; We should have no trouble fooling a bunch
of dumb colonials and their equally dumb blue-rinsed ladies , especially
if we get them well tanked up beforehand on whatever ice-cold fizzy poison
they consume in their part of the world!&nbsp; I really think I've found
my vocation at last as a shameless fraudster&nbsp; - God, but it feels
so good!"</b><b></b>
<p><b>.................................................................................................................................</b><b></b>
<p><b>Professor the Reverend Canon&nbsp; Felix Algernon Hurst-Pierpoint-Majors,
the Dean and Principal,&nbsp; was going over with Jimmy Fraser, Captain
of the College First Fifteen,&nbsp; the arrangements for the Harington
Theological College's away game with the Jeremiah Bible College at Twickenham
a week on Saturday.</b><b></b>
<p><b>"This little village here looks a good place for you all to stop
off for a bit of refreshment on the way back, my boy.&nbsp; I know it so
well.&nbsp; Plenty of good old hostelries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere to celebrate
thumping the shit out of that nest of&nbsp; beastly Nonconformists - excuse
my language dear boy!&nbsp; And I believe they have some kind of fair taking
place on that day - new thing since my time, but it should be great fun!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chance for you all to let your hair down!"</b><b></b>
<p><b>"Yes, Sir!&nbsp; It looks just about the ideal place to break the
journey.&nbsp; I just hope we're not too knocked about to take advantage
of the local hospitality.&nbsp; Pity you can't come with us, Sir!"</b><b></b>
<p><b>"I agree my boy.&nbsp; I'd love to visit the old place again.&nbsp;
My first Parish, you know.&nbsp; A heavenly and blessed spot.&nbsp; I wonder
how those lovely&nbsp; little cherubs are, the ones I christened in my
first week there - dear little Julia and Beatrice!&nbsp; Cousins,&nbsp;
and orphans now, sad to say.&nbsp; Oh, yes!&nbsp; I'd dearly love to go
there once more!"</b>
