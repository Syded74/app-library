Told to strip... for no reason
by TheBlushingPrincess 

Part 1

It's college. Apartment off campus. I get home from classes and my friend Sophia has let herself into my apartment. She's on the couch looking at her phone. She looks up at me.

"Kelly."

"Hey. What are you doing here?"

"Go take a shower."

"What?"

"Go take a shower and then come out in your towel. I want to look at you."

"Are you kidding???"

"No. Go do it. I'll be here, waiting. Don't take too long."

My heart starts racing. I know Sophia likes to toy with people like this. I don't get it. Why does she want to see me in a towel? Does she like me? I mean, I'm not a lesbian, and she knows that. I mean, she just exudes sexual energy. She's smokin' hot with this aloof, sadistic streak in her.

I hesitate.

"Go, Kelly. Now. Go shower."

I don't know why, but I do what she says. I go to my room and strip down and head to the bathroom. I turn on the water and start washing. I'm nervous but excited. I dry off. My hair is still wet but not dripping. I wrap myself in a towel. It's pink and fluffy. I'm about to open the door and walk down the hall, but I get scared. Then excited. Then scared. Shit. Why am I doing this.

I call out. "Sophia?"

"What."

"I'm out of the shower."

"Good. You know what to do."

I turn the knob and open the door. My heart is racing. I tightly hold the towel in place. I peek into the room. Sophia sees me.

"Come in. Let me see you," she commands.

I walk in. I'm standing a few feet away from her as she is casually reclining on the couch.

She looks me up and down.

"Turn around," she orders.

I don't know why, but I do what she says. She has that effect on people.

"Face me."

I do.

"Okay. Nice. Now lose the towel."

"What?"

"On the floor. Now."

I hesitate.

"NOW!"

Fuck. I drop the towel.

She looks at me. "That's nice. Just stand there a minute. Let's have a good look at you."

She stares into every inch of me.

"That's nice, Kelly. Nice."

I'm on fire, just standing there as she looks at me.

Then she says, "Okay. You can go get dressed."

I'm shocked.

"That's it???"

She's lost interest. She's looking at her phone again.

"Yeah, Kelly. That's it."

"Why?"

"Just wanted to make sure you would do whatever I say. And now I know. So that's good."

I'm dumbfounded. Standing there, naked. Speechless. She's not even looking at me.

"So I can get dressed?"

"Yes."

I can't move. I'm so horny. I thought she was going to do something to me.

I pick up the towel and start to walk toward my room.

She calls after me.

"On second thought, stay naked. Go lay down on your bed. And don't touch yourself. I'll check on you in a bit."

Fuck.

I walk naked to the bedroom and do exactly what she says.

Why?


Part 2

So I went into the bedroom. I draped the towel over me for some reason. Not sure why. Sophia wasn't even looking at me. I was so turned on. Crazy, I know. Why did I even do what she said in the first place? You walk home and your friend tells you to shower and come out in a towel? You say, "Forget it." But not me. Nope. Not me. And now here I am. Laying naked on the bed, just waiting. And on top of it, she told me not to play with myself! What the fuck! So why am I doing what she said?

And the longer I lay there not touching myself, the more I want to touch myself. Total Sophia. All these games. Fuck. I am not a lesbian. I'm not even bi-curious. I mean, I like a manly chest and a nice cock to play with. What the fuck am I doing? I should just get dressed.

But I can't move. Something about her. It's those dark, piercing eyes. Or those incredible curves that I could only dream of. I mean, sure. I'm cute as all getup. But Sophia? Fuck. She's hot. If I'm sweet, she's spicy. And my mind starts to wander to all the things that she could do to me.

Fuck. Snap out of it.

My fingers start to drift below. But as soon as I'm about to touch myself, the door swings open. There she is. Just staring at me. I snap my hand back and instinctively cover my breasts and cross my legs.

She walks over.

"Give me your hand," she demands.

"What?"

She takes my right hand, lifts it to her face, and sniffs my fingers.

"Good girl," she says, and drops my hand.

She stands above me and looks into my eyes.

"You like to do what you're told, don't you, Kelly?"

What?

"Um, what?"

"You like when I tell you what to do. It turns you on. It's okay. You can admit it."

Fuck. She is right. I'm so turned on. And yes, I like it. It's exciting to be told what to do. To be made to shower. To be instructed to drop my towel. To be ordered to lay naked on the bed and not touch myself. Fuck. How is she always right?

But I don't say anything.

"Admit it. You like being told what to do."

I can't speak.

"Say it." She is calm and reassuring, but firm.

I swallow hard. Quietly, I emit a tentative "Yes. I like it."

She smiles. "Good," she says.

I stare into her eyes. She looks me over. She pauses at my thighs for a bit. Not sure why. Then back to my chest. Then my eyes.

"Shall we have some fun?" she asks.

"Um, fun?"

"The correct answer is, 'Yes, Sophia. Let's have some fun. Whatever you say.' Try that."

I swallow again. Why am I doing this? But I can't help myself.

I let out a barely audible, "Yes, Sophia. Let's have some fun. Whatever you say."
