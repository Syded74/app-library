CHAPTER NINE

KOUMARIKAH

And so, As the weeks had gone by, `Idith accepted our ways:
She 'greed to watch us do 'ur kill, as she had known that 
we're her Friends!
She'd even watched us eat a girl, although she could not 
join herself;

And Nogah winked me, "worry not! She'll be with us 
before 'ny long!"
And, as always, trust my Sis  she knows the Best 
what is to be!

It was one afternoon, and suddenly we heard a noise!
I took a spear and went to look  and right front me, stood 
girl and boy!
The girl was old, perhaps 19, but the boy was still a child:
Maybe 7, maybe 8  most certainly younger than 9!

I said:
What have you to do in here  wouldn't you know that 
'tis Our Realm?
But, since You came now, oh so near  you shall never be 
let to leave!

The girl said:
Oh, please let my Brother Free  he's only 8 and innocent!
And I take oath, never speak a word  please, oh, jus' 
please do not hurt him!

I winked at Danny and then said: sorry, but you should have
known better
than to dare enter our Pardes  an act which punishment 
is Death!!

The girl paled.

Danny said:
See, we've nothing against you two, but we do really 
must be on guard!
Our girls are soon to give birth, and all outside is: hostile lands!!

The girl said:
But then I might be of some help, I had helped labor 
many times!
Oh please just let me be of help  and I shall never 
betray Your trust!!

And so we let her in 'ur tents, given her bro we'll keep by us.
And tearsomely, she had agreed, and so, accepted in 'ur Realm.

Both girls stressed and had then us asked, "why did You let 
her come inside?
She's a risk, a major risk for us  should she go out, all 
of us'd die!"

Danny said:
Worry not, she'll dare not say a word  as she knows, 
her brother shall then die!
Rest asure, she would not be of harm  would not be
of harm to 'ny of us!!

The girl said:
Being from a kibbutz, I have many times helped 'ur nurse 
in doin' all her chores!
With helping girls at labor being my specialty!!

`Idith said:
In such a case, ho please do come,
Please do come to me  as You I'll need!!
I've had those sharp pains right now  my
Twins may be'mpatient me to leave!!

The girl said:
Worry not  I am here by You  I 
am right here now, by Your own side!!

And so, the girl had helped them both
give birth to all our Lovely kids!!
By Nogah I had the most Lovely girl, that has
EVER walked the Earth!!

And gentle `Idith, give birth to Twins
- one's femme, the other masculin!!

And so, after their labors were over and our 
Adorable babies, were happily drinking milk off 
their Gorgeous, Enormous tits, we had sat by the fire 
 as it was already after midnight (the girl has had 
a watch  which was good, as `Idith's had just ceased 
working the week before that, as its battery ran off) 
 and the girl  Sarah  had told us all about her. 
Her Brother, Arik, was also present.

As it had turned out, her coming there was to bring about 
the most blissedful change in our Life, at least ever since 
Danny&`Idith's arrival  and the fact, that it has 
coincided with the birth of our first-born children 
 first of many, many more to come and populate 
the Pardes Realm  has seemed, to us, like the work of 
a supreme, higher intellect of some sort, some unknown kind 
 of which nature we have all begun to wonder, as a result 
of Sarah's arriving at our Camp&Land.

So, it had turned out, that she was already 23 
 waaaaaaaaaaaay older than what we had all thought 
at first  from the kibbuts of `Heftsiba, by Mount Gilbo`a, 
near the Jordan Valley and not far away, from lake 
Kinnereth ("the Sea of Gallillee"). She was a BA-Student 
at the Hebrew University and an expert, in both 
herbal-medicine and ancient Mythologies, she was extremely 
Openminded, and she was a Wiccan and a Witch; yep, 
just like Piper, Phoebe and Paige.;-)) And, apart of 
all this, she just happened to look so much like 
Holly Mary Combes

Well, that doesn't matter  as all events described, 
took place quite a few years, before "Charmed" has first 
been aired. We are now talking about December 9th, 1990 
= the Birthday of Ya`ako'v (Jacob), Ra`he'l (Rachel) 
and Naava; see, `Idith insisted, upon giving her Twins 
Biblical names  and what's more suitable, than these 
of the first two tragic Lovers, in our Nation's History?

My Sister and I KNEW, of course, that it has been a 
most-special homage to us; and Nogah reached `Idith, and 
kissed her, fully, on her lips

So, after our two Beautiful Love-Angels had finished 
frenching one another, Sarah went on with her Story.

"You know, Nogah", she smiled at my Admirable Sister, 
"Your name's just like the Creator's". "Really? How come?" 
wondered Nogah. "the World-Creator = the Dragon-Serpent 
Naga, according to an ancient Burmese tradition". 
"Hmmm a Serpent" Nogah smiled. My Sister has always 
adored Serpents. And lizards. And butterflies and rabbits 
and hermits and bees (but that's besides the subject). 
"Yep. He cyrcled around and around and around, until 
this whole World came into being". "A Ser-pent" my 
Twin-Sister smiled, ironicly, winked at me, crawled over 
and pretended to be biting my thigh; we had played such 
mocking games a lot as children, back in our Previous Life 
(as it had now seemed), back Home  and also, just when 
we had begun to play Erotic games.

"And I have always known the Serpents to be the anti-
creator, the anti-God", said `Idith, and Sarah nodded. 
"Yep. That is why, in the Bible, a large portion was 
dedicated to eradicate the Serpent-worship, which had been 
common here, just like everywhere else".

And Danny said, zsmiling Lovingly at me, "I _know_ I do 
speak for us all when I say, that ABSOLUTLY ALL OF US, 
shall be obliged AND delightful, to worship Nogah for a 
Total, Eternal and Complete Eternity, for just as long as 
any of us lives".

I just could not have put it better myself.
