Sally back to school - 1

Pool at School:
[ school has started for the fall season ]
[ second day of school ]

########## School Days ##########


The electric grid was still not fixed by the time school started in late Summer. The first day of school was a half day, which was a good thing because without air conditioning the buildings became unbearably hot by lunchtime dismissal. Even so, one of the kids had a heat emergency and had to be taken to the nurse's office.

In the second period classes of the second day the school speakers crackled to life requesting that Becky, Sally, and Alicia report to the principal's office. The girls met up with each other in the halls as they walk to the office area and complained about the stuffy heat and how tiring it was to make the short trip. Entering the office door they were greeted by the principal. Standing with him were the two parents of each of the girls.

[Principal] Hello Sally, Alicia, Becky. Your expressions took a downturn when you saw your parents here. This is not a hostile meeting. The school has a problem and we want to solicit your help. OK? Due to the nature of this meeting your parents are present, but again, due to the nature of this meeting they have elected to simply watch and listen via Skype in the next room. They can rush to your rescue if the need arises but otherwise will not participate. So, you grownups, my office is yours. Skype is all connected and set. Young ladies, lets go sit down in the conference room.

[Principal] (they sit around a conference table) This laptop at the end of the table gives your parents the audio and video feed of what we do here. Let me pass out these folders, one for each of you. Alicia. Becky. And this is yours Sally. I will start with why we are all here. Late last spring there was a heat wave that caused an electric overload resulting in a short blackout. The blackout did not last long but it caused some damage and the power situation has become much worse over the following months. It spread from being a city problem until now it has half the country involved. Things are so bad that many places, like this school, are no longer allowed to run the air conditioners. Now, many schools in the world are in hot areas without air, but those buildings were designed to operate that way. Ours was not. We have the ventilation fans running full speed and still some students are in danger from the heat.

[Principal] So, why are you three here? Many school boards in the emergency areas have changed the dress codes for this semester. With being too hot, and "dress code", I'm sure you can guess where this will go. There will be an assembly tomorrow about that. Now as to how you can help ... If you will open your folders you will see some pictures taken by security cameras over the last spring and summer.

The girls open the folders and see some rather grainy large format pictures of themselves at recent big events.

[Becky] These are topless pictures of us. (getting very defensive) And Sally has a nude picture. Is this blackmail?

[Principal] Against you? No. We blackmailed your parents into allowing you come to this meeting. Sorry, that was a joke. This is not blackmail. These are the only pictures like this here at the school, no more will be brought in. Students that are caught with these kinds of pictures will have them confiscated and destroyed. Over there in the corner next to the potted plant is a shredder. You may make use of it if you desire, and that will be the end of it. Security cameras do not take good high quality pictures, but these images do illustrate why we in this office think you three would be willing to help us.

[Principal] Lets start with your packet Becky. The talent show records indicate that you were the leader of the Tahitian dance troupe. Your costume was quite a surprise last May. You danced beautifully and your poise during and after your time on stage was inspiring. The picture on top shows you on stage dancing. The next one is from a security camera that points to the area where the gourmet food trucks were parked, and there you are ordering a lunch with some boys from your class. Still topless long after your part of the talent show was done. In fact all of your troupe were that way until closing time, weren't they?

[Principal] Alicia, your pictures are of the talent show Reed Dance ... very nicely done by the way ... and your pictures are much like Becky's. You also performed that dance at the mid-summer solstice festival in a small ethnic exposition area. I do not have pictures of that but I was in attendance. Your costume for that and the talent show was essentially just a loin cloth or some such, with a beaded necklace in tribal colors for a top. No problem there. I noticed that you changed the wardrobe a bit from talent show when you had a very large audience. With the smaller ethnic crowd you performed the dance commando.

[Alicia] Hey! Its authentic! My big brother showed me YouTube videos.

[Principal] Well, it was authentic before the King got worried about the tourists and demanded that the dancers wear black bikini bottoms or black shorts.

[Alicia] (Gasp!) My brother didn't tell me that.

[Principal] Sally, this first picture here in your packet is of you at the World Naked Bike Ride, yes? Most riders get nicely decorated in body paint. Many of them are works of art in themselves. You are one of the minority that didn't have even that thin cover. No paint, just skin. Later in the day, this next image is from a 7-11 store. What really grabbed my attention was the time-stamp. This is about 5 hours after the ride had ended, and you still have not gotten dressed. Looks like you are buying a soft drink. (Sally interjects "It was a Slurpee". He responds "Bleah! I can't stand those, too much sugar.") Now this final picture is about 10 at night, at a taco stand I think, when a group of riders reformed for a night time tour of the city. You are still not dressed.

[Principal] Not to dwell on these photos, but they do show that you three have the ... well, lets just say we doubt you will reject our request for help out of hand.

[Principal] With this heat and power emergency, we cannot cool the school rooms. We do not know when power situation will go back to normal, therefore we cannot shut down the school and wait out the crisis. There are no other buildings we can use, yet school MUST go on. Some of the summer school students have passed out from the heat, and in Mississippi two kids died. We have taken some steps to mitigate the problem, but the big change will be resisted. This school's dress code will be modified to "There Is No Dress Code". You students can dress however you need to stay cool. What would have gotten you expelled last year will be considered modest this year. What is allowed now going forward is Anything down to Nothing. This year many schools are forced by God and the electric company to become clothing optional.

[Alicia] My older brother gets on internet porn sites and reads stories about Naked In School. Will this be anything like that?

[Principal] No. We will go over that tomorrow at the assembly, but most emphatically no.

[Principal] Well, thats the lead-in for this meeting. Now we come to how you can help us. Tomorrow when home-room starts we will announce that the day will consist of a "field trip" to the university pool next door. Since we do not leave school property (for a loose definition of school property), no permission slips are needed. Please do not tell the other students about this. 

[Becky] If we do not tell, and this is a morning surprise, none of the others will know to bring their swim suits.

[Principal] That is exactly right. And the pool has a strict policy of no street clothes in the water. Such a shame that none of the students will have swim gear, don't you think? Hmmmm. What to do? Swimming will have to be done nude. This will be a big culture shock for the kids, so when the announcement is made that the pool is open to the students we hope you three will help us by leading the way. We hope you will be the first in the pool, appropriately attired. Just so you will not stick out as oddballs, a small crew of university student women will be lifeguards and swim helpers, also appropriately attired.

[Sally] Cool! Wait till Lisa ... We really can't tell anyone?

[Principal] Well, for all three of you, if there are friends who you are confident will join you but won't spread the word, that is fine. All this secrecy is mostly to contain the disturbance this swimming trip will cause. Parents keeping kids at home, parents yelling at me, things like that. I can't imagine any boys skipping school on their own tomorrow if they find out early.

[Principal] When the morning is over, swimming will stop for food. The school cafeteria workers will cater the lunch. Most kids that swim will dry off and dress up to eat. My hope is that you, and any friends you can rope into this, will stay nude the whole time, starting with the morning swim, continuing for the lunch break, through the afternoon swim, and even the trip back here for the assembly. Much like you did Sally, at the bike ride.

[Sally] What about after the assembly? How long do you want us to be naked?

[Principal] My main hope here in this meeting is that you stay undressed until after the assembly. Tomorrow's change in the dress code will be a complete reversal from the last hundred plus years. Your help and participation will be a tremendous assist in getting the students to accept the new reality. A secondary hope is that you three will spend another week nude, to drive home to the students that yes, it really is OK to take your clothes off. After that I can't see any call for the school staff to direct your actions. Girls gotta be girls, and I know you like to dress up with the latest fashion styles. There is no need for you to abandon that part of your life.

[Principal] Now, what's in this for you? I am rather constrained in what I can offer. No money directly of course. But I can offer special tutoring from the university, special classes, connections ... things like that. Anything you need to get a leg up on the start of a higher education or career path. If the lack of money made college a question before, we can help.

[Principal] I need to take a break for a few minutes. You three can chat and see if this has any interest for you. Would you like a drink? Water? Cola? There is a small fridge in that corner there. Help yourself.

[ ... break time ... ]

[Principal] Ok. Is everyone still comfortable? Have you made a decision?

[Alicia] We all want to do this. Each of us has different reasons. I can dream of college now.

[Sally] (with a wicked smile) I like the dress code. And the pay is good too. The college classes I need will be very tough ... I've seen the thermo book my big sister is using. A tutor is the only way I can get through that.

[Becky] My college goal is not so hard, but it is very specialized. If you have the connections for special training then I am all in.

[Principal] Since we cannot run the air chillers, we are saving about ten thousand dollars a month in the electric bill. If I don't have the right connections, we have a budget where the connections can be bought. We are just coming out of some years of political insanity, so tell me what you need as soon as you can. I want to get it funded and pre-paid as much as possible, just in case somewhere up the food chain the money gets diverted because an idiot wants an office make-over, complete with golden plumbing fixtures.

[Principal] Now to a serious matter. I like the new dress code too. As a lecherous old fart nobody will be happier about the coming year than I. On the darker side, the thing that gives me fits is the security and safety of you students, both from outside strangers and each other. We in the office don't have many good ideas. So I ask for your help again, what can we do? ...

***** Afternoon Assembly *****

[Principal] Good afternoon everyone. The purpose of this assembly is to let you all know what is coming, actually starting today, starting now. As you have found out, the electricity crisis prevents us from turning the air conditioners on. We cannot run the school in the same way as before. Because of the heat a new dress code will be implemented here at this school and we need to let you know what to expect, and what is expected of you. As you have seen from todays trip to the university's pool, things are not what they were.

[Principal] At each end of this stage are my four helpers today. On my left is Lisa and Becky, and on my right is Sally and Alicia. As most of you kids know, they are all students here in this school. They are volunteer demonstrators for this talk, and hence they are nude. You can expect to see them in school, like this, for the next, well, for however long they want to do this. Starting now, the dress code is "There is No Dress Code". You kids need to dress with an an eye (thinks: oops, I need to rephrase that in any future speech) to keeping cool.

[Principal] Now, I want to talk about the security of you students. For your safety, for the next year students MUST be dressed when they enter and leave the campus. We don't know what the reaction will be amongst the town dwellers, and our paranoia dial is set to eleven[2] right now. If nothing bad happens this year, we will relax this policy next year. For your in-school safety, over on this end of the stage you can see four Ninjas. They will be here for at least four weeks to protect the students that elect to be nude. They will escort these students between classes and otherwise ensure that problems are quickly taken care of. They are highly trained, as you might well imagine, and yes the swords are real. A short demonstration should convince all you students to behave politely for the school year.

The principal turns the stage over to the Ninjas who throw fruit into the air and slice it cleanly into small bits.

[Principal] Thank you sirs. Remember kids, if you put an unwelcome hand on any other students, you will have to pick that hand out of the dirt and get it sewn back on. Seriously. Don't push your luck. Now, on to more pleasant things. We have installed some new plumbing around the buildings. The sprinkler system has been extended by adding rudimentary showers. These outdoor showers are marked by being installed on bright blue poles, and the concrete under them is also painted blue. You can use them to cool down between classes. Bring towels to dry off, as we will not look kindly to your leaving behind a chair with a soggy wet seat. Be careful not to get your books and assignments wet. An excuse of the shower ate my homework will not be accepted.

[Principal] Are there any questions? You! In row 5 with the green shirt. Yes, you. Please stand up, state your name and ask your question.

[Randall] Randall. My name is Randall. I'm really hot. Can we start the new dress code right now?

With this question Randall wobbles uncertainly and bends down to rest his head on the back of the seat in front of him.

[Principal] Yes, you can start right now. (looking at Randall closer) Looks like you are in some trouble son. I need two teachers to help Randall to the nurses office.

[Principal] (after Randall has been guided out of the auditorium) Next question? You, yes in the blue shirt, please stand up and state your name.

[Strutter] My name is Strutter.

[Principal] Ok. Thank you. What is your question?

[Strutter] I've read about this on the internet. What about Reasonable Requests?

[Principal] No. We don't have a perfect birth-control shot, nor a super effective STD pill. There is no magic. There will not be any Reasonable Requests. And before you ask, I have seen the mess that the custodians have to clean out of the boys toilet rooms every evening. Ugh! Disgusting. I will not subject the girls to that. There will be NO mixing up of restrooms or gym showers. Next question?

[Principal] In the back, next to Mrs Phillips. State your name and ask the question.

[Wally] Wally. My name is Wally. Will there be any Relief?

[Principal] (in a stage whisper) "Randall", "Strutter", "Wally"! What is this? Who's next? Horseflesh?

From the middle of the auditorium comes some smart-alek calling out "Horseflesh is dead!"

[Principal] (as the teachers are scrambling to find the culprit, the principal breaks up in uncontrolled laughter) Yes! Yes indeed. Horseflesh IS dead. Good one. I see we both have the same great taste in movies.[3] But no. This is not a teenage boy's wet dream. You want relief, go outside stand under one of the sprinklers and take a cold shower. Also I suspect we will have to modify the dress code and decree that boys can be nude on odd days and girls on even days, just to make sure there is no hanky pank going on. But we will let that go for now. Anyone else?

[Principal] Yes Ma'am, with the head scarf.

[Behnaz] My name is Behnaz. What can you do to help a devout Muslim? We will not be able to bare our bodies like that.

[Principal] I had not thought about that. One thing to do is to take an outside shower with your clothes on. That will cool you off. But you can't spend the day wet, so bring 3 or 4 sets of clean dry clothes every day. We will set up a portable closet or change room for you. Tell one of your teachers which shower you will use and the closet will go there. You students do not have to go nude. You have the complete range of dress options, bikinis, shorts, whatever, to try and stay comfortable.

[Principal] That brings up another point. For any of you kids that feel the need to stay fully dressed, whether for your religion or for modesty, this heat is intense, and you only get to pass out once. If you pass out from the heat you will have to go home and will not be allowed back until you are ready to spend the day in an outfit of OUR choice. Come to the office some time for a preview of what WE think is appropriate. You do what you need to save your soul and your sanity, but you do NOT get to come here and make us watch you die.

[Principal] OK. That is all we have time for now. School is over for today, see you all tomorrow. Oh! Before you all disappear, the outdoor showers are working. I encourage you all to make use of them. Just for today we have a couple of soap bubble generators blowing big gobs of foam to entice you all to start dressing down ... why is everyone grunting and pointing behind me? (turns around) Oh! Becky! Did you want to say something?

[Becky] Yes! (in her excitement she grabs the microphone out of the principal's hand) I'm going out to the foam! Who's going with me? (she sticks her hand up in the air. the students cheer and some hands go up. Becky looks around the stage and her 3 friends all have arms raised. hands microphone back).

[Principal] We will have cell phones out there for you to call your parents and tell them you will be late today. All right! Go cool off and have some good clean fun.
