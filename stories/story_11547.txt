Chapter 12: A Debt Repaid

When I woke the gaol was dark and silent. I was shivering from the cold, my wounded leg stiff from the hard bunk and my eyes sore from a restless night that had done little to sooth my weariness. Hobbling over to the washbasin, I listened for any clue that might reveal the time, a change of the guard or the rattle of breakfast dishes being prepared, but all was still.

I splashed water on my face and ran my hands over my stubbled cheeks, yearning for a razor. At least the cold air had subdued the rank smell, that or my nose had simply become desensitized by the foul odours. Without my watch to tick away the seconds, or any activity with which to engage myself, time seemed frozen in place. I had no idea how long it might have been between my waking until a constable came with a dish of porridge, nor how long between breakfast and my next visitor of the morning.

I was lying on the bunk, wondering if Holmes would remember to eat without me there forcing food upon him, when the door creaked open. Inspector Cinwell lurked at the threshold, pale eyes cast down at the floor. "Come with me please, Doctor."

I rose to my feet, checking a sigh at the thought of enduring more faux interrogation while he waited for me to confess to the theft. He stepped to the side and motioned me through the door.

"No handcuffs this time? Have you at last determined that I'm no threat?" I made no effort to conceal my limp and the absurdity of treating an old, crippled doctor as a dangerous criminal.

"The charges against you have been dropped. You're free to go." Cinwell said, ignoring my limp and indeed my whole person, still gazing at his scuffed shoes.

"'The charges have been dropped.' Just like that."

"Just like that."

"Would you care to enlighten me what changed your mind regarding my innocence?"

"Mr. Holmes made arrangements for your release." Cinwell's flat expression--neither bitter nor triumphant--put me ill at ease. He led me down the long corridor, past the cell doors and out into the main lobby.

"Are you saying that Holmes proved that I'm not guilty?" I did not know what to think if that was the case��"gratitude, of course, for contriving my liberation, but unrest about the sort of deception he must have engineered to supply his "proof." However noble my motives, I had been a participant in the theft, and although I had seen Holmes neglect to point out evidence to the police, I had never known him to outright falsify facts.

"I'm not saying that at all," Cinwell replied. "I'm saying that he secured your freedom." He strode to the main desk, where a sergeant on duty passed him a brown paper bag. This he handed over to me. "Your belongings. Everything should be accounted for."

I opened the bag and drew out what things had been confiscated by the custody officer: my watch, pocketbook, pen, and some loose change. Amongst the change was a gleam of bright gold, the engraved words of the physician's oath, Primum non nocere, breaking the sheen. I glanced sharply at Inspector Cinwell, and for the first time that day he met my gaze.

"That is yours, I believe? You don't have to answer; the fingerprints did confirm it," he said in a slick tone.

"I thought this was evidence," I said, unable and unwilling to hide the cynicism colouring the final word.

"It's no longer needed." His eyes darted away again. "Take it and go. There's a cab outside waiting for you."

The transition from the dim indoors of the station to the midmorning sun was not as startling as I had expected. Heavy clouds slithered low across the sky, the filtered light rendering the colours of the city more vibrant in contrast, from the sanguineous red of a lady's hat to the midnight blue of a gentleman's tie. A cold breeze blew in from the river, chilling the tips of my ears, and making me yearn for my hat which had been left behind in Mr. Wooster's flat in the confusion of the arrest.

It was a short ride from the police station to Berkeley Mansions, but I fidgeted the entire way, my stomach fluttering with as yet unnamed dread. I was up the stairs and at the door to Mr. Wooster's flat as fast as my protesting leg would take me.

As soon as I knocked, Jeeves opened the door and led me to the sitting room. Mr. Wooster's expressions were as simple to read as a children's book. He sprang from the settee with a bright "What ho!" but the wide and open grin he gave upon first seeing me collapsed quickly into confusion and from there fell into horror. My throat tightened.

"Holmes." I coughed to clear the boulder that had settled on my chest, crushing my heart. "Where is Holmes?"

"He left," Mr. Wooster said, fiddling with the buttons on his waistcoat. "Last night. Jeeves and I told him not to go, and we thought he'd agreed, but then next time we turned around, poof, he was gone. We tried to go after him--"

"Gone where?"

Wooster babbled further about supper and the fire escape in words that I scarce could hear for the rushing in my ears. I grabbed him by the shoulders before I realized that I had even crossed the room. "Mr. Wooster, where did Holmes go?"

Wooster shook his head, his blue eyes wide. Jeeves, however, had the answer I needed and yet dreaded. "Your presence here, sir, can only mean that he surrendered himself to Roberson."

Wooster, his brief fit of muteness overcome, squeaked out, "There was a telegram, you see. It's over on the sideboard if you want to see it. Roberson wanted to bargain, you for Holmes. You're here, so Holmes must be..." Wooster trailed off, for which I was grateful. If their suspicions were correct, then Holmes had been in Roberson's clutches for nearly twelve hours now. Although logic told me that there was no better explanation for Holmes's absence, the irrational and idealistic part of me that Holmes so frequently belittled longed for some other explanation, one that would see Holmes safe. Holmes's own voice seemed to rise up from my subconscious, however, to chide me for such foolish optimism in the face of cruel facts.

I released Mr. Wooster and walked to the sideboard as if in a daze. Picking up the telegram, I wished it would disintegrate in my hands as if its destruction could erase its history. It remained hopelessly real, the cheap paper brittle under my fingers.

"Is that a code at the bottom?" I said, tracing my finger along the strange line of letters and numbers.

I hardly noticed that I spoke aloud until Mr. Wooster replied, "It is. 'The Spotted Dog, Ratcliffe,' it says. Jeeves thinks that's the place Holmes was to hand himself to Roberson."

I needed no other words. First, I hurried to the guest room to retrieve my service revolver. As I left the guest room, rushing to the front door and tucking the revolver in my pocket, Mr. Wooster called out, "Where are you going?"

"To The Spotted Dog, of course!" I pushed my hat down upon my head and reached for the doorknob.

"Sir," Jeeves said, "Mr. Wooster and I already examined the premises last night when we first discovered Mr. Holmes's absence. By the time we reached our destination, he was nowhere to be found. When we queried the clientele, we learned that Mr. Holmes had arrived an hour earlier and then departed in the company of four men, one of whom fit Roberson's description. It was a meeting place, nothing more. There is nothing to be found there."

My hand dropped to my side. "I must do something. Perhaps you missed a clue, some trace, which could lead me to their whereabouts."

"We were most thorough in our examination, sir. According to the publican, Mr. Holmes was in the location for no more than five minutes. He sat at a table with Roberson and three other men. He smoked one cigarette and refused a drink. Afterwards, all five of them left in a black car, which drove east. They left nothing behind save for empty glasses and burnt out cigarette stubs."

"Jeeves could even give you the name of the drinks they had and the brand of cigarettes they smoked, if you like," Mr. Wooster piped up. "We cased the place up and down, side to side, top to bottom."

I longed to believe that if I went to the pub, I would discover something new. My honest self-assessment, however, knew that such an outcome was nothing more than a wishful daydream. Perhaps Holmes could have coaxed a busy and dim lit pub to unveil further traces after twelve hours of spilt drinks and drunken carousing had spoilt every square inch of ground, but I could not. I removed my hat and dragged myself back to the sitting room, smothering the voice inside my mind that screamed for me to do something, no matter how useless. Now of all times I could not afford to act illogically.

"Is there any way to track the car?" I asked Jeeves.

"No, sir. It was an unremarkable vehicle and no one saw the registration plate."

"Then what the devil do we do? There must be something, some way to find him. I can't just sit here while Holmes's life is at stake."

Mr. Wooster wandered into the conversation. "Under normal circs, I'd suggest someone contact the police, but given our recent troubles I don't suppose that they'll be much good."

His words jogged loose a memory. "Of course! Lestrade!" I exclaimed, to Wooster's confusion. "Jeeves, send a telegram to Mr. G. Lestrade, Number 14, Noel Road, Islington. Tell him that Roberson has Holmes and ask him to come here as soon as he can."

Jeeves departed to send the telegram. I prayed that Lestrade would be at his house to receive it. Pacing up and down Mr. Wooster's flat for what felt like eternity, but could not have been more than three-quarters of an hour, I was half-mad with impatience when the doorbell finally rang and Jeeves admitted Lestrade.

"I came as fast as I could," he panted as he removed his hat. "What's happened?

As we moved to the sitting room, I elucidated recent events, everything that had happened since I last saw him yesterday afternoon, and showed him the telegram Roberson had sent. Jeeves, meanwhile, drifted silently about the room and brought out stiff drinks to soothe restless nerves.

"We need to find them. Is there anyone on the force we can trust?" I asked, turning the glass of whisky around in my hands.

"There's at least one fellow I'm sure of. Shelton. He was my sergeant before I retired, and was promoted to inspector a few years ago. He'll find some trustworthy constables. Get them out looking for any trace of Roberson or Mr. Holmes." Lestrade took a swallow of his drink. "But there's not much we can do. London is a big place; we can't search it all."

"Holmes said that Roberson has hiding places down in the East End. We could focus our search there."

"We'll do that," Lestrade replied gently. "But it's still leaves us with a lot of ground to cover."

"Of course," I replied blankly. "Whatever help you can provide would be most appreciated."

Lestrade rose from his seat, setting down his glass, and stood before me, solemn and grave. "Doctor," he said, placing a firm hand on my shoulder and bending so that we were face to face. "I'm going to be frank, because I know you're the sort of man who appreciates honesty."

I braced myself for what I knew he was about to say, focusing on keeping my breath slow and even.

"I'm sure Shelton and the rest will do everything they can, but, well, it doesn't look good," Lestrade said with sombre sympathy. "Mr. Holmes has already been missing for over half a day. We don't know where to begin to look. And Roberson..." His voice softened. "We have no reason to expect that he'll be merciful. People who vanish under circumstances like this, they aren't usually found. Now, Mr. Holmes isn't your ordinary kidnapping victim, and he's surprised us plenty in the past. But..."

I did not trust myself to speak, or even to nod to indicate that I heard. It was as though my skin were a thin veneer of ice on a winter pond and one small disturbance would shatter whatever appearance of calm I possessed. Lestrade patted my shoulder in an awkward attempt at comfort, but I barely felt it. Fortunately, Mr. Wooster took charge of the conversation, for I was struck mute and senseless.

"Be that as it may," Mr. Wooster said, "we aren't going to give up yet. Why, when I was a lad, I once lost my cat for two whole months before--"

"Sir," Jeeves interrupted, shaking his head slightly and flicking a glance in my direction. Some distant part of my mind wondered what I must have looked liked to cause him to abandon his customary formal deference, interrupting his young master. Whatever pitiable air I had, it was sufficiently palpable to compel even Mr. Wooster to silence. It was this, strangely, that drove me back to my senses. It was my duty, my role to remain calm while others panicked, to be grounded and sensible while others fluttered about. The realization that Mr. Wooster of all people was currently more self-possessed than I exposed to me how far gone I was.

I breathed out a long sigh, and, burying my fears deep, returned to the world. "Mr. Wooster is correct. We're not giving up. As soon as the police find the slightest clue--"

Lestrade spoke before I could complete my thought. "I'll keep you updated on every detail of the search, I promise."

"Thank you," I said gratefully, as I escorted Lestrade to the door.

Lestrade gathered up his hat, saying, "And if you hear anything new��""

"We'll send you a telegram at once," I finished.

Lestrade nodded and left to contact his associate. There was nothing to do but wait and hope that either the police were fortunate in their search or that Roberson would slip up. I did not think the odds of either circumstance occurring were very high. Speaking not a word, I dragged myself to the guest room to change and shave. My clothes still smelled of the gaol. Although the completion of my much-needed grooming rendered my appearance more civilized, it did nothing to raise my spirits. I still felt as trapped and hopeless as I had while confined to that rank cell.

Lestrade was true to his word, and sent frequent reports on the status of the search. Other than the first message, however, which informed us that Inspector Shelton, once contacted, was happy to take up the case, all the rest were the same. No trace yet. Search continues. In this way, hours passed. Luncheon came and went, although I barely tasted the food put before me.

The atmosphere of the flat was grim, quiet, and dark. A mist came up off the river during the mid-afternoon. Drops of water dewed on the window and streaked down the glass, distorting the view of the world beyond. It was in the middle of this unpleasant weather that Mr. Wooster received a visitor. When the bell rang, Mr. Wooster jumped from his seat.

"Whoever it is, tell them I'm not at home. I've got better things to worry about than Tuppy's latest woes or Barmy's new wheeze."

"Yes, sir." Jeeves said as he drifted to the foyer. The moment he opened the door, however, the guest did not wait to be rebuffed, but slipped under Jeeves's arm and strode into the sitting room. Jeeves followed with a disapproving glint in his eyes. "I am sorry, sir. She would not be put off, nor did she offer her name, but rest assured that she is neither Mr. Glossop nor Mr. Fotheringay-Phipps."

Tall, slim, and black haired, she wore a red sheath and carried a matching purse. Her lips were scarlet and her eyes darkly rimmed. Despite her youthful adornments, however, the lines around her eyes and mouth indicated a woman of middle age. She did not dress or comport herself as the sort of lady I would expect to find amongst Mr. Wooster's circle of acquaintances, nevertheless, he recognized her immediately.

"Ettie! Why, imagine seeing you here!" He said as if greeting an old friend. Within a moment, however, his smile vanished. "Wait a minute, you kept me tied up. You're one of Roberson's goons, a lady-goon, if such a word exists. You've got some nerve showing up at my home unannounced. I dashed well don't want you anywhere near me or my flat, and I'm certainly not going to offer you a drink. So you can just betake yourself away right now." He pointed at the door in a wide and firm gesture.

I drew my revolver. Whatever the details of Mr. Wooster's experience with the woman, he had fingered her as a friend of Roberson and therefore an enemy of ours. She did not appear armed, but appearances could be deceptive, especially, as Holmes so often liked to remind me, when a woman was involved.

"Close the door, Jeeves," I said. Jeeves obeyed without question, shutting the door behind the woman Mr. Wooster had called "Ettie" and standing with his back against it, blocking her escape. I nodded at him once in gratitude. I raised my revolver and aimed it at her chest. She gaped when she saw the weapon, her eyes wide.

" 'Ere now, I've come to help!" she protested. "There ain't no call for that."

"Do you deny that you work for Roberson?"

She tossed her hair, plastering self-assurance over her alarm. "I ain't denying that I done him a favour or two. Marcus's good for a tit for tat, and he's a man who's better to have as a friend than an enemy. But he's not me boss. I'm a free woman. I run me own business and there's no man tells me what to do."

"You participated in Mr. Wooster's confinement."

"I didn't do the poor boy no harm."

"Why are you here? More favours for Roberson? Another damned message?"

"I already told you I ain't here for Marcus. I'm here to help you. I've got information on Mr. Holmes. But if you ain't interested..." She turned as if to leave, uncaring of the pistol still pointed at her and Jeeves blocking the way.

"No!" I cried out, desperation raw in my voice.

She faced me with a smug twist to her lips. "You'll have to put that away," she nodded at the revolver, "before you get a peep out of me. I don't like threats."

"No." I added, "I don't trust you."

"I'm on your side!"

"I'm afraid your mere protestations of good will aren't enough."

She sighed, aggrieved. "Fine." She thrust a hand into her purse and pulled out a handsome little derringer. She pivoted the barrel and let the cartridges fall into her hand. "Good 'nough now?"

"Not quite."

"What, do you want to search me?" A vicious smile spread across her face. "If you do, I want it to be the rich and handsome young one what does it."

Mr. Wooster took a frightened step behind me.

"I can't make you trust me. But why else would I come here, then? Marcus's got what he wanted, don't he? He don't give a damn about you. He wants to kill Mr. Holmes more than he wants to kill you. And to get Mr. Holmes to come along all peaceable, he had to swear that he'd not hurt you, or so I was told. He's done with you. I'm here of me own will. To��""

"To help," I interrupted. "Yes, you've said. What you haven't said is why. Double-crossing Roberson can't be safe. I don't imagine you're here out of sudden fit of remorse, so what's your motive?"

Her eyes flashed and her red lips pursed. In another time, another life I might have thought her a fine-looking woman. Such an observation only made me tense further as I imagined Holmes's reaction had he been here and tried to push from my head images of what even now might be befalling him.

At last Ettie spoke. "I owe Mr. Holmes, that's why I'm here."

"Owe him? Why? For what?"

She blinked rapidly and lowered her head and at first I thought that she would refuse to answer. "I don't suppose one of you fine guvs would give a girl a ciggie, would you?" The evasion was obvious, but I took pity on her and acceded to her request. After Mr. Wooster offered her a light, she resumed as if she'd never paused.

"When I was still a young thing, there were a man who was copping his fun beating and raping girls and carving all manner of strange words and symbols into their skin. One of them bled right to death, a girl what he cut too deep. A few died of infection after. I was lucky." She pulled the neck of her dress down, revealing a few inches of bare skin. There, at the top of her breasts and half-hidden by white fabric of her undergarments, were a series of thin scars. "We was all scared to go outside. It was like them Whitechapel murders all over again. The bobbies, they couldn't give a damn about us, but Mr. Holmes, he came in and he sent that bastard to hell. Got him caught, tried, and hanged."

"I don't remember this case."

"Of course not," she replied scornfully. "You was off being respectably married at the time."

I suppressed a flinch. The years of my marriage were trying ones for my friendship with Holmes. Although he was never impolite--or at least no more than was usual for him--in the years leading up to his disappearance at Reichenbach Falls, he avoided my company and was often evasive and uncommunicative when I asked about his doings. It would not be unreasonable, therefore, to assume that he had engaged in many cases of which I had not been aware. Regardless of the plausibility of her tale, my aim did not waver.

"Trust me or not, as you like," she said. "It don't make a whit of difference to me. But it might mean the world of difference, life or death, to Mr. Holmes."

"If I may interrupt, sir," Jeeves said, stepping away from the door. "I believe it would behove us to listen to what Miss Ettie has to say."

"It's Mrs. Fordyce to you. Henrietta Fordyce," she interrupted.

"My apologies, Mrs. Fordyce," Jeeves replied before returning his attention to me. "As I was saying, sir, Mrs. Fordyce may have crucial information. As her demands are simple and not unreasonable, namely that all weapons be put away, I suggest that we comply. Once we have gathered what information we can, then we may concern ourselves with ascertaining the veracity of her tale and determine which steps to take accordingly."

Reluctantly, I lowered the revolver and took a seat, placing the pistol on the coffee table where it would be in easy reach should it become necessary. "Now, what do you know about Holmes?"

She slunk into the chair opposite mine and tapped her cigarette over the ashtray. "I know where Marcus is keeping him."

"Where? Where is he?" I tensed on the edge of my seat.

"Hold your horses, I'm getting to it!" She took another drag of her cigarette and it was all I could do not to snatch the thing from her hand and shake her until she gave answers. After what felt like an eternity she said, "Marcus's got these warehouses, down on Wapping Lane. These last few weeks he's been having cages brought in there, the sort you'd use to transport circus animals, like. They're for his merchandise; he's going to have them put in his ships soon as they make port. I'd bet me old grandmum's heirlooms that Marcus took Mr. Holmes there. It's a good place for that sort of thing. Secure. Private. No houses nearby to hear..." She trailed off for a moment. I noticed that my fingers had dug into the upholstery of the chair and made a conscious effort to relax them. Ettie continued. "To hear anything suspicious," she finished tactfully.

"Do you know what he plans?"

"I don't know no specifics, just that Marcus intends to kill him eventually, but none too quick. So I reckon that you still have time to save him."

Without my conscious will, my hand drifted up to cover my mouth to contain the sick horror that was rising up my throat. I was disgusted to find myself grateful to hear that Roberson intended to torture Holmes, for the simple reason that if Holmes was suffering than at least he was still alive. It was the height of selfishness to prefer that Holmes be in agony than leave me, but I could not apologize for it. Pain and the memory of pain would fade but death was forever.

My tongue was numb and my throat dry and empty as a desert. I was grateful when Jeeves took over the conversation, saying, "Thank you for the information, Mrs. Fordyce. Is there anything else you can tell us? Any detail might prove useful."

She shook her head. "I told you everything I know." She crushed the end of her cigarette in the ashtray and stood. "I've got to get back to me girls."

"Much obliged for the help, Ettie old girl," Mr. Wooster said, escorting her to the door. He reached inside his jacket for his pocketbook. "May I offer you a fiver for your trouble?"

A flash of longing crossed her features. "I told you I'm settling a debt. Wouldn't be much of a settle if I got paid for it, ain't that right?" She smiled and her eyes narrowed to dark crescents, her hand reaching out for Mr. Wooster's sleeve. "There is something what you could give me, though."

Mr. Wooster laughed nervously. "And, ah, what would that be?"

Ettie slid her hand up Mr. Wooster's arm and smirked at his darting eyes. Then she stretched on her toes and gave Mr. Wooster a matronly peck on the cheek, grinning mischievously as she drew back. "That wasn't so bad, now was it?"

"Right. Yes." Mr. Wooster cleared his throat and shuffled Ettie to the door.

As soon as she left it was as if I'd broken from a trance. Trustworthy or not, I could not bear to let another second slide by in which Holmes was at Roberson's mercy whilst I sat and did nothing. Ettie's story might lead me to a dead end or a trap, but it was all I had and so I grasped it with fervour. I stood and paced the sitting room. My leg was still a trifle stiff from last night's sojourn in the local gaol, but my limp was nearly gone. It would not slow me down appreciably, and that was all that mattered.

"Send another telegram to Lestrade," I said to Jeeves, rushing to the guest room to fetch my medical bag. I feared I might have need of it once I found Holmes. "Tell him that I'm going to the warehouses on Wapping Lane and ask him if he can get Inspector Shelton and as many constables as he can gather to meet me there as soon as possible."

"Yes, sir," Jeeves replied.

Mr. Wooster shrugged back into his own jacket and followed me into the guest room, saying, "I'll just go fetch the other pistol, shall I? The Webby-something-something. I'm no good with it, but I'm sure that Jeeves will handle it like a master."

I grasped his meaning in an instant. "Mr. Wooster, you're under no obligation to accompany me on what's likely going to be a very dangerous endeavour."

"By no means! There's the Code of the Woosters to consider," he retorted. "Anything to help a chum in need. And right now, you're in more need than has ever been any chum I've ever had. It is a matter of family honour, of decency, of good...thingness to friends. The Woosters of old would roll in their graves if I failed to display boldness, courage, and whatsits in the face of danger and abandoned the forward charge. I suppose I shouldn't speak for Jeeves, though. Not being a Wooster and all, he doesn't have to go if he would prefer not to."

Jeeves's eyes narrowed. "Under no circumstances will you undertake such a risk without me."

"Well, that's that, then." Wooster slapped his hands together. "It's decided. Jeeves and I are coming with you to lend whatever meagre aid we can."

The telegram was sent off to Lestrade and Holmes's pistol tucked away in Jeeves's coat pocket. Jeeves led the way to the garage where Mr. Wooster's automobile was kept. Even the small time it took to get ourselves arranged in the seats seemed too long. At last, we were on our way.

"Tally-ho!" Mr. Wooster said, pressing on the gas, sending the auto racing away from the gloaming light.
