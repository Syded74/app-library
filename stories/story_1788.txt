<b><font size=+2>25</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"What fucking kept you, Bernard?" asked Gwen.&nbsp;
"I left&nbsp; a message for you before we flew out.&nbsp; You're very hard
to pin down."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I'm a busy fellow, Your Ladyship.&nbsp; Lots of things
to sort out when diplomacy fails - you'd be surprised - or would you -
maybe not!&nbsp; Any way, since this seems to be a girl thing, and a very
well-organised girl thing at that, just put this next to the fuel tank
and run the wire up out of the way of&nbsp; all this bloody&nbsp; flood,&nbsp;
as far it will go.&nbsp; Then attach it to this device here, push down
the plunger and get the fuck out of here, if you don't want to barbecued
along with everuone else.&nbsp; I suggest you go straight up into the hills
to where you left your friends ten days ago.&nbsp; There will be people
waiting for you, I imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glad to see you safe, Harriet,
and well done Gwen - give me a kiss, both of you and see you in London
sometime!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>With this, Bernard disappeared back into the gloom
and Harriet and Gwen rigged up the explosives as directed. They got as
far from the fuel compound as possible, as directed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gwen pressed
down on the plunger.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed as if the entire world had returned
to daylight.&nbsp; They ran until they reached the vantage point from which
Jessie and Gwen had first seen Harriet and turned round to admire their
handiwork.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The entire administrative quarters were ablaze and
it was clear that all inside the meeting room must almost certainly have
been incinerated.&nbsp; The fuel dump was blazing and many of the helicopters
and armoured vehicles were just bits of molten twisted metal.&nbsp; All
the carefully planned military build up of the past few months had gone
up in smoke in seconds.&nbsp; The rain had spread the leaking fuel over
the entire base and it was now,&nbsp; literally,&nbsp; a sea of fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few panic-stricken people could be seen running away, but only a very
few indeed had made it out of the conference building/ briefing room.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Golly, Harry!&nbsp; Doesn't it look pretty?&nbsp;&nbsp;
I always liked a nice firework display - I suppose it's the sweet, innocent
child in me!&nbsp;&nbsp; It's all the more satisfying, somehow, when you
are the one responsible.&nbsp; I've always felt I would have made a wonderful
arsonist, if only I didn't have a business to run!&nbsp; I feel just like
singing in the rain, Harriet my darling girl."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Don't you feel sorry for those poor people in that
building?" asked Harriet.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Fuck off, sweetheart! Just think of all the people
they've butchered.&nbsp; Worse than that,&nbsp; they robbed you of a year
of your precious sweet life,&nbsp; they caused me to leave home, which
I had sworn I never would,&nbsp; they tortured me for four horrible&nbsp;
hours and you for half an hour.&nbsp; And as if all that weren't bad enough&nbsp;
they fed me on the most disgusting so-called food I have ever eaten in
my life - fucking hell, Harry, even school meals weren't that fucking bad!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>As they spoke, the sound of helicopters could be heard,
growing louder, and soon they were hovering over the remains of the rebel
encampment.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I suppose we'd better start walking back to civilisation,
my love" said Gwendoline.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I don't think you two ladies are going to be walking
anywhere" said a voice from out of the darkness.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The two girls turned around as a group of men and two
women made their way towards them.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Oh, Jessica!&nbsp; You didn't take my advice and go
home!&nbsp; And Alicia - meet my darling&nbsp; Harriet - doesn't she look
so divinely lovely with the rain dripping of those gorgeous titties of
hers?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Alicia Mboya certainly was impressed by the girl they
had all helped to rescue and on whom her own husband had once been so keen.&nbsp;
She had seen Harriet from a distance through binoculars, but nothing had
prepared her for the sight&nbsp; of&nbsp; Gwen's friend close up.&nbsp;
Despite her breathtakingly lovely face and magnificent red hair, the girl
seemed to be made of muscle.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Algernon Mboya, the Minister of the Interior, who was
the leader of the group,&nbsp; put his two hands one on each of Gwen and
Harry's shoulders.&nbsp; He could not conceal his relief and satisfaction
as he spoke.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Congratulations, you two!&nbsp; It seems we've scored
a great victory over the rebels, thanks to you!.&nbsp;&nbsp; Given a bit
of backbone and organisation on the part of my colleagues, we should have
them beaten in a few months.&nbsp; Let's get you two back to the capital.&nbsp;
I think we can rustle up some clothes for you both before we board the
helicopter."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwendoline was furious at this last&nbsp; remark.&nbsp;
Her eyes flashed with rage, and she brushed away Algy's hand..</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"My darling Harry here has gone through hell this last
year and more.&nbsp; She&nbsp; and I have between us done something your
fucking useless army could never have achieved in a million sodding years.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And our reward is that we be forced to wear CLOTHES!&nbsp;&nbsp; I've never
heard of such base fucking ingratitude.&nbsp; We don't either of us intend
wearing a stitch of clothing as long as we remain in this country of yours!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Even at the press conference?&nbsp; The world's media
are soon going to be here in force, you know."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I'm notorious as the Naked Countess, as it is and
it's a label I wear with pride!&nbsp; I'm not ashamed of my body and neither
is Harriet,&nbsp; are you my darling?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Absolutely not!&nbsp; Just about the only good thing
in the last year's captivity has been that I've been stark naked&nbsp;
for every second.&nbsp; You can't take that away from me now!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harry had&nbsp; her arm lovingly clasped around around
Gwen's waist as she said this.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Jessica smiled broadly,&nbsp; happy to see her childhod
friend safe and well after the risk she had taken for Harriet's sake.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She was also a little sad to see how totally the red haired girl had supplanted
her in Gwen's affections.&nbsp; But = "so what?"&nbsp; she thought -" I'm
a married woman now with a lovely little boy, and Gwen's a generous outgoing
girl with plenty of love to share around&nbsp; - me,&nbsp; Harry AND Jim
- she's room gor all of us!." (Which was one way of referring to the Countess's
versatile and ravenous sexual appetite!)</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>After this refusal by the two heroic women to don clothing
and Alicia's decision to emulate them in their nudity yet once more, the
party embarked on the swift journey back to the capital, Zambekia City.&nbsp;
The four girls looked down at&nbsp; the countryside over which they had
all trecked - first Harry in her unwilling role as a captive and then the
other three as her would-be rescuers. It all seemed such a short journey
from up in the sky, but it had still changed two people's lives, especially
Harry's.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>.......................................................................................................................................................................</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>It was mid-morning and Gwendoline and Harriet had spent
two nights in the most luxurious suite of the capital's best hotel.&nbsp;
Gwen was lying&nbsp; on her tummy on top of the bed , one hand propping
up her chin and the other turnng, from time to time, the pages of a book.&nbsp;
Her legs were bent at the knees so that her feet were sticking up into
the air, her ankles crossed and her feet flexing themselves lazily from
time to time.&nbsp; Harriet was kneeling beside the bed, one hand on the
small of Gwen's back and the other resting lovingly&nbsp; on the top of
her thighs.&nbsp; She was kissing and licking by turns every inch of Gwendoline's
pretty bottom and had been engaged in this pleasurable activity for some
time.&nbsp; Ever so often and increasingly, her tongue would dart down
between Gwen's cheeks, reaching ever further into that delicious crevice.&nbsp;
Finally she sank her face right down onto the soft warm flesh and buried
her thrusting tongue deep inside her friends delightful crack.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Harry, my love.&nbsp; I've just had a wonderful idea.&nbsp;
Can't think why I never thought of it before - most odd!"&nbsp; Gwen had
put her book to one side after placing a bookmark to keep her place.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Yeth, Gwen?"&nbsp; Harriet had omitted fully to retract
her tongue as she lifted her head away from her pleasant task.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"First of all, stop trying to lick my anal sphincter.&nbsp;
It's not nice!&nbsp; Secondly and more important, I think now you have
so deliciously softened up my botton with your lovely moist, warm tongue,&nbsp;
the said arse is ripe for a couple of love-bites, one on each cheek.&nbsp;
Go and get my camera first.&nbsp; I want a photo of those lovely red teeth-marks
to keep and treasure for ever.&nbsp; Bite as hard as you can, my darling!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>A fearful scream rent the air as Harriet complied with
Gwen's request, followed by peals of laughter.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Gosh!&nbsp; That was really a new departure, Harry
- fucking wonderful!&nbsp; I love you more and more.&nbsp; Maybe I will
let you work for me for even longer than two years, if you're very good.&nbsp;
Let's get back to bed!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Half an hour later, Harriet her flushed face from Gwen's
moist vagina and said.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Do I get paid when I come and work for you, Gwen?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"What do you want to be fucking paid for?&nbsp; You're
rich enough already, you greedy bitch!&nbsp; NO - you get your food and
lodging and in return you work for me all day and satisfy my sexual needs
all night.&nbsp; When Jim is around, alas, your&nbsp; nights will be your
own, although you can and will work longer hours at such times&nbsp; -
since you won't any longer need the strength to satisfy me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
After all, Harry, I did come and rescue you!&nbsp; I expect and I&nbsp;
will receive the proper appreciation and gratitude owing to me for that
selfless act of bravery."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Will it be as hard as the last year"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"A bloody sight harder, Harry.&nbsp; One can't go back
in life or rest on one's laurels - always forward and on to greater efforts."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I'm really looking forward to it.&nbsp; Why can't
we go back today?&nbsp; I miss England so much!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I've paid for this suite for another two nights, Harriet.&nbsp;
It wasn't cheap, I can tell you!&nbsp; Your ingratitude and thoughtlessness
can be most hurtful sometimes!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Thanks, Gwen!&nbsp; It's lovely here.&nbsp; I can
wait another couple of days - as you said back in that awful cage - as
long as we're together it doesn't matter where we are!"</font></b>
