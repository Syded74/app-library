Our short story today is set 500 years in the future. Much has changed, much is the same...

                    
An Alien Moment.

He sat looking at the dull, grey, dingy walls with distain. His eyes scanned the room looking at every detail. Every detail, but one. He could not bring himself to look at her. This was odd, she was after all his partner of some 15 summers. But if he looked at her she would cry, hell, he might cry.

Just then he was saved. The door opened and someone came in, a very large formally dressed someone. He said nothing, just closed the door and moved towards them. Slowly he flopped his large bulk into a chair
and wiped his dripping brow. Eventually he spoke.

"So for the duration of this interview you," he pointed at the male, "are subject X, and you, my dear are subject Y. I have a note of your real names. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Agent 716394.2. You may call me 71 if you wish, many do."

71 settled back in his groaning chair. Deftly he flipped a blue data pack out of his top pocket, and plugged it into the similar shaped hole that appeared in the table. He grimaced and spoke, this time more slowly, pronouncing
each word as if it were his last.

"Activate. Agent 716394.2. Voice ID. Interview with subject X and Y, a couple. Topic - claimed alien abduction."

The Agent wiped his brow once more, and then glanced at subject X.

"OK, all set, who wants to begin? I just want the facts, no supposition, no emotions," his glowering gaze shifted to subject Y, "just nice, clean facts!"

Subject Y lowered her eyes. The Agents penetrating gaze shifted back to X. When X finally spoke his voice came out as a thready high pitched whine.

"We had been home for about two hours when..."

Agent 71 stopped him in mid-flow with a simple, but stern look of disapproval.

"Clearly please, this is an official record. Do you need a sedative? There will be a charge, of course. But it might help."

"No, sorry. No more seds, Mart... I mean subject Y and I are pretty strung out already. Nothing illegal, you know all genuine Pharms.

71 wafted his arms across his face dismissively.

"This is more important than the habit. Go on."

"We had been home for about two hours when this odd sort of rumbling started. It really penetrated you, you know, sort of shook up your innards."

"What sort of sound?" asked 71.

"No sort of sound! That was what was so odd. You didn't hear the rumbling, you felt it. Then the smoke, thick, copious smoke, pouring in through the doors and windows. I thought the place was on fire! So I go to move, but I can't. Not one muscle. Not to move, not to talk. At least my eyes still work, I look at M... Subject Y. Just like me she's stuck to the furniture, but her eyes are wide with fear."

71 interrupts.

"Tell me, had it been a hard day at work? Had you taken any seds?"

"Well yeah, you know, work is always hard. We wound down with some Narcolon. But this wasn't the seds. I have been taking Narco for thirty years, I know what a sed trip is like."

"OK, sure X, it wasn't the seds. Oh, and just for the record what stimulants do you use?"

"We both use the same, creatures of habit. So it's Cafuwake in the morning and Narcolon at night. All genuine Pharms."

"Look X, I am not on the habit squad. How you get your meds does not concern me OK? I use Cafuwake too. Are you collecting those discount tokens. The one's for the designer stim?" 71 asked.

"Of course, who isn't! What do you think it will be?"

"No idea. But the tokens only come with the genuine cake. This I know for a fact. So, calm down about the meds."
 
X smiled, and changed posture. He settled into his seat. 71 was a good guy. This was going to be OK. When he spoke again his voice was more relaxed, even confident.

"Where was I? Smoke, that's right. The room slowly filled with this thick grey smoke. But it was just like the rumble, the rumble had no sound and the smoke, no smell! Try as I might I still couldn't move. But I stopped worrying about that when the light came. Blindingly bright, it flooded the whole room."

"What colour?"

"Huh?"

"The light, what colour?" asked 71.

"Good point I forgot that. Well it was white to start with, but then it changed, and twinkled with every colour in the spectrum. Finally it dulled, but the colours still swam in front of me. With the smoke and everything it was hard to see. I could only just make out Y. Then they came."

"How many?"

"Four, four of the oddest looking things. Tall, spindly, silver beings with big round reflective heads. It looked like their heads were just one big shiny eye. Two of them took Y. The other two, the biggest ones, got me. Something stung me. When I woke up, I was on their space ship."

"So you didn't see the outside of the craft?"

"Not then, but I did when they left. It was like a saucer, but elongated, cigar-shaped. Big lights at the front. One minute it was hovering there, then, flash gone! Faster than anything I have seen, I couldnt even guess at the speed."

71 scratched his bald forehead, frowned, and lent forward.

"So what did they do to you? They did do something. Yes?"

"Yes, but do we have to go into that?" X gulped.

"Why no! I called you here for a nice gossip. I was feeling a bit down. So I thought why not get X and Y in for a chat. We could talk about the weather, or the rate of inflation.

71 paused, and coughed clearing his throat. 

Of course I want to know what they did!" 71 spat out his words.

"Sorry, naturally. Well, when I came to I could see clearly again. I was strapped down to some sort of platform. Ma... Sorry, Y was next to me, strapped down just the same. We were in a bright room. Quite big, bigger than our lounge. We were alone. But that didn't 
last long. Soon they joined us, and they undressed. The big globes came off first, then the silver suits. It wasn't skin like I first thought. Underneath they were even weirder. Look 71, could I have a drink or something?" X asked.

"Sure, my turn to apologise. Where are my manners, would you like one too?"

Y nodded back.

71 stood, and turned to face the blank wall. He motioned a waving arm over a spot that was just a lighter shade of grey than the rest. The dispenser emerged from the wall.

"OK guy's and girl's what's your poison?"

"It'll be a A9 for me and a D3 for Y, please"

"Good choice, very healthy. A B6 for me. I'm trying to cut down. Lose a bit of bulk, but it's damn hard."

With practiced ease 71 collected and carried the three drinks to the table. He placed each one carefully, and then he lifted his to his plump lips. He downed the steaming concoction in one long swallow.

"Oh, that hits the spot! Please continue."

X sipped his drink a few times, blinked, and began to talk.

"Underneath they were even weirder, as I said they were bipedal and real skinny. They had two tentacles, inflexible ones, they only bent in the middle. Each tentacle split at the end though. Little wriggly tentacles emerged. They used these to hold things."

"OK, good description - tell me how many of these little tentacles did they have?"

"Huh, well more than four. It was more than four, wasn't it Y?"

"It was five, you forget. I saw one close up. Five!"

71 looked at Y, she was sure jumpy, especially for someone on as many seds as X suggested they had dropped.

"Five, five is good. Carry on X."

"Turns out their heads weren't big, but small with little beady eyes. They ran their beady eyes all over us," X shivered visibly at the  memory, "nasty sharp, pointy faces. Sneering at us always sneering. Well the two big one's come over to me. Without a word one of them sticks his tentacles between my legs and pulls them wide apart. Now I  realise, I'm naked. Naked in front of these things, and they are examining me."

X picks up his drink and takes a long swig.

"I look over to Y. She's naked too. The smaller things are doing just the same to her. They are bending over her  and looking, well, you know, there!"

71 growled his disgust at this revelation. He raised a waving arm, and interjected.

"The big aliens, were they any different from the small ones, other than in size?"

"Well they were scrawnier than the big ones. Except their thorax's! Now you mention it they had bigger thorax's in proportion to the big ones. Weird. 

X paused for breath.

Still, I saw the ones with Y grab a cable from the ceiling. As they pulled it down I noticed the tip of it. It widened out into a sort of blunt probe. Then I realised what they were going to do!  The aliens were going to put that thing into Y. I closed my eyes. I didn't want to watch.

X released a long, painful sigh.

Anyway a minute later my eyes are wide open again. Something is sucking at my organ, milking it. There it stands stiffly protruding from my body. My organ is trapped inside this wide probe-cable thing, and it is slurping away on me. The sensations are incredible. Out of this world I tell you!"

"OK, and ahem, you produced?"

"Yeah, I couldn't stop producing. Nor would you have been able to. I didn't want to, stuck there with those things. But the sensations were too much." X started to sob.

"Look, it's OK. I'm not here to judge you." 71 moved his eyes to Y, "And you, what happened to you while X was producing?"

Y's colour darkened noticeably.

"Well sir, 71,  X had been right. They put the probe deep inside me. The top of it seemed to latch on deep in me and then it began..."

Y looked over at X.

"It's OK M... Y tell 71. He's a professional.

"It began to swell and pulsed inside me, at first it disgusted me. It felt like a thick worm inside me eating away, and then the pulsing stopped and it began to vibrate. My feelings changed, and when the sucking started deep inside me I was lost. I just floated on a sea of desire. The aliens, the space ship and To... Sorry, X just faded away. Nothing mattered, only my feelings. I'm so ashamed!"

71 watched in pity as unwiped tears cascaded down Y's streaked cheeks.

"OK, sorry to put you through this. But I now have enough. Deactivate. Agent 716394.2. Voice ID. Interview with subject X and Y, a couple. Topic - claimed alien abduction."

                    *******************

Long silent minutes passed, while X and Y consoled each other, and calmed down. Once they were finally settled, each of them turned and looked expectantly, even hopefully at 71.

71 rose from his seat and returned to the wall. A second later a screen emerged. The words on the screen hit X and Y like a sledgehammer.

"Tomak'Nha and Marthu'Nha. I am duly serving you with a penal code 44-1865. I Agent 716394.2, am duly authorised to serve this notice under Security Act 44-1223. The conditions are clearly shown, but I will read them to you."

"You may not disclose any information on the subject of this interview to any citizen."

"If you have disclosed information to other citizen's prior to this interview, you must retract all statements, and explain the true circumstances that led to this false memory."

"Should you fail to do this, and/or continue to propagate this story full penal sanctions will be enforced."

"Do you understand?"


Tomak swallows hard, he tries to remember where he is, and who is telling him this. He fails.

"Yes, I understand. You are gagging us, something big is going on and the Government is, once again, covering it up. Well I'm going to sing it from the roof tops. You see if I don't Agent 71."

Martu's arm snakes through Tomak's. 71 coughs heartily, smiles wanly, and speaks.

"Look, Tomak I know how you feel. But this is for the best. Continue on that way and you will never leave this building, let alone see a roof top. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with Martu sat in a small cell, no stims, no seds. No meds at all. Forever. Do you want to watch Martu grow old. Like that?"

"No, no I don't..." replied Tomak in a small broken voice.

"Good! So let me tell you what happened to you two nights ago. OK?"

"Sure, anything, I just want to get out of here." 

Tomak winced.

"Me too, I want you, both of you, to get out of here. I like you guys.

71 paused, to let that sink in.

So then, you both came home from work. Bad day, real bitch of a day. To wind down you each took two tabs of Narcolon. Now as it turned out, you were even more tired then you felt. Before long you had both dozed off. Then something disturbs you. You think you are awake. But you are not. The seds and the tiredness have taken their toll. You are part-awake, part-asleep, so the body
is shut down. Effectively paralysed. This is what stops us thrashing around when we sleep. The seds kick in, and the rest is a trip. A long, colourful, really bad trip. One of the less publicised effects of mixing Cafuwake, hard work, and too many Narcolon's. OK have you got that?"

"Yeah, got it. Can we go now?"

"Not just yet, first you both need to voice ID these for me."

71 slips a couple more data packs out of his pocket. He fiddles with the table and two more slots appear.

"These are your statements, just to match our explanation. We have synthesised these using your voices sampled during the interview, and downloaded to the packs. It's a good copy of your voices. But not good enough to fool the Courts software. So I need you to voice ID them for me. It's the only part they ever bother to check."

"My, my you are so well organised!" smirks Tomak.

"We exist only to serve. We have to be organised Tomak. Now ID them!"

                 ***********************

Agent 716394.2 opened the door to his office and sidled in. He strode over to the console on the far wall, and placed two data packs on the glowing surface.

Statements with voice IDs Tomak and MartuNha.

He watched intently as the packs faded into the surface.

Statements saved 

71 grunted his satisfaction and crossed the room to a large flip-topped bin. Carefully he retrieved the final data pack from his top pocket. He studied it carefully, much as a botanist would study a rare, dying bloom. Sighing he flipped the lid of the bin. The data pack joined hundreds of others.

Wearily he dragged himself to his recliner, his massive form slumped forwards onto his spotless desk, and his head sunk deep into his arms. Beside him a communicator crackled to life.

'Secured transmission from Agent 561245.7 to Agent 716394.2 voice ID, please'

"Agent 716394.2, proceed."

'Connected'

"Hey buddy! 56 here, how did it go?"

"Yo! 56, well it's a positive. Nice, sane couple. I served them with an 'Alien Moment'. Damn, I hate this job sometimes."

"Alien Moment! So it was the whole event then?"

"Oh yeah, samples for breeding, the whole thing. So damn detailed I could even draw you a picture. I don't know if she will ever get over it. I think it spoils them, some how."

"Look you are just doing your job, like I was doing mine."

"56, did I hear right? You were doing yours? What are you talking about, surely you are doing your job?"

"No more, 71 no more. I know too much."

"Like what, why talk in riddles?"

"71 the outer rim planets... The Colonies have fallen. The aliens now control them."

"The Colonies? But those guys had weapons. They opted out of our 'peace, love and drugs' culture 400 years ago. I dont know any more, probably they had the right idea. I mean what are we going to do when they get to us? Offer them a Narcolon and a fireside chat?"

"They never fired a shot 71. Not one shot. That's what the abduction and breeding program is all about. Bioengineering. The aliens use our own biology against us. They breed us, study us, and find out what virus it takes to overcome us. By the time we recover from their designer virus, the invasion is done and dusted. The aliens are installed at every level of government and commerce. There is no escape, none."

"You mean there's nothing to stop them?"

"No 71. We have nothing, and our government is considering surrender, prior to any Bio-attack. I'm sure they will go for it. Reports from the Colonies suggest that millions could die from the infection. So I'm out of here tonight. Do the same, get your family, and go. Leave the City, head for the countryside. If we can get far enough away, it may take years for the aliens to find us."

"56 that's crazy talk. Worse, treason. Are you serious?"

"Hello 56, can you hear me?"

'Secure channel closed. Agent 561245.7 no longer has clearance. Please do not try to contact Agent 561245.7.    Agents despatched to debrief you, please do not attempt to leave the Agency. Thank you.'

Home channel Agent 716394.2. Urgent.

Home channel unavailable. Agents despatched. You will be reunited, once clearance is re-established. Thank you.

71 felt unknown emotions flood into him. Even the blend of Pharms could not keep them at bay. We would have names for them, betrayal, hurt and anger. Agent 716394.2 had none, the words had died centuries ago. 

He staggered from his desk, full of these barely contained new feelings. Shaking, he stood before his office window. Outside, the other side of a thin sheet of silica, life continued and the evening rush had begun. 71 looked up into the dark sky, the stars were appearing one by one. 

Suddenly he remembered the awe he had held the night sky in when he was a kid. But now it teemed with threat, not promise. His world would fall, his children be enslaved. Just to satisfy the greed of the aliens. Why did they have to be so greedy, how could a species be so morally corrupt? 

Agent 71 slammed his six arms against the cold glass. His tentacle tips writhed in anguish, each swimming in its own sea of slime. At last the rage was too much; it burst from his chest in a mighty roar, tore through his throat, and flew from his lips. Resounding around his office and bouncing off walls, ashamed by its impotence.

"Why, why do you want what is ours? What right do you have? You evil repulsive abductors! Sneering rapists! If I could get hold of just one despicable Earthling! I would show it the true horror of an alien moment!"


So as our story draws to a close, we see that 500 years in the future. Much had changed. Much is the same. In fact far too much is unchanged

The End.
