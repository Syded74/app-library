Fic: The Mummy
Title: The Mummy
Pairing: Jared/Jensen
Rating: NC-17
Wordcount: 18,000
Summary: It was supposed to be an easy treasure hunt in the desert, but now Jared's got a four-thousand-year-old undead mummy who thinks Jared is his dead girlfriend to deal with. Also featuring Jensen as the rugged adventurer and Chad as the comic relief.
A/N: This is very very very closely based on the movie "The Mummy". Don't come here looking for a fantastic and interesting re-interpretation of the plot! Thank you to waterofthemoon and changethemusic for the fantastic beta jobs (I think I need a crash course on comma usage). ♥♥♥!

The banner under the cut is by me. It is supposed to be craptastic. :P
