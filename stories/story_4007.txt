              Valerian Smokes a Cigar

	Valerian drained the last of his coffee and set the empty 
cup on the small table next to his armchair.  "Shem," he said 
toward the ceiling, "send in Mia."  He selected a cigar from the 
humidor on the table, lit it and settled back in the chair.
	He had taken only two long drags from the cigar and was 
releasing the last as a series of smoke rings when the study door 
slid open and a slight, thin figure stepped in.  The door hissed 
closed.
	"Yes, sir?"  The wem, a young one of about 18, stood with 
her hands clasped in front and her eyes down.
	"Good evening, Mia," Valerian said.  "How are you tonight?"  
He clicked the privacy switch on the arm of his chair, isolating 
the den from the rest of the house.
	"Just fine, sir," the girl answered, still not looking up.  
Her face was vaguely Asian, perhaps Eurasian, framed by long 
black hair.  Her eyes - scarcely visible from this angle - were 
large and dark, with long lashes above high cheekbones.  Her 
figure was slim, almost boyish, although the close-fitting dress 
showed off her small breasts, her trim waist and the modest flare 
of her hips.  The high-collared, ankle-length dress of jade green 
velvet was slit on one side to just below the knee, revealing a 
well-formed calf and slippered foot.
	"Do you feel like some fun tonight?" Valerian asked.
	The wem did not answer for a moment.  Her eyes flicked 
upward to Valerian's face, then back down.
	"Of course, sir," Mia said quickly, as if to make up for 
her hesitation.  "If you wish."
	Valerian smiled around his cigar.  "I think I do," he said.  
He took the cigar from his mouth and blew out a stream of smoke.  
"Get me a brandy, would you?"
	Mia turned and walked to the sideboard in small steps 
enforced by the long dress.  She raised her head as she walked, 
revealing a softly rounded chin above an elegant neck.  At the 
sideboard, she lifted the stopper from a crystal decanter and 
poured a generous amount into the snifter next to it.  Taking it 
in both hands, she carried the tulip-shaped glass across the room 
to Valerian, once again lowering her eyes toward the floor.  Mia 
knelt gracefully at Valerian's feet and presented the snifter, 
one hand under the bottom.
	As he took the glass from her, Valerian noted with pleasure 
the elegance of her every move, the gracefulness with which Mia 
presented the glass to his hand, two arching fingers supporting 
the base, the liquid in it scarcely moving.  When the brandy 
sloshed as he took the snifter from her hand, a brief frown at 
his own relative clumsiness twitched the corners of his mouth.  
He raised the glass, inhaled the fragrance of the amber liquid, 
and took a sip.  The warmth slid across his tongue, into his 
throat, and down into his stomach. 
	Mia knelt near his knee, eyes down, hands on her thighs.  
Valerian looked at her, enjoying her beauty, considering his next 
move.  He dipped the damp end of the cigar into the brandy, then 
put it into his mouth and took a puff.
	"Why don't you help me get ready," he suggested.  Mia 
looked up at him briefly.  He nodded reassuringly, and she 
lowered her eyes again as she raised up on her knees and reached 
toward his waist.  Her slim fingers released the knot in the belt 
of his dressing gown, draped the belt over the arms of the chair, 
and then folded back the gown, revealing his bare chest, plump 
stomach and pajama pants.
	"But, first, a kiss," Valerian added, putting the cigar in 
the ashtray.  Mia placed one hand on the arm of the chair and the 
other on his thigh as she raised up on her knees and slowly 
tilted her face upward.  For a fraction of a second, her eyes met 
his, then her eyelids slid down to cover them.  The tip of her 
tongue appeared to moisten her lips, then withdrew as she parted 
and extended them slightly to meet his own.
	Valerian enjoyed kissing his wem.  Mia's lips were silky 
soft and warm, tentative but accepting.  He slid his tongue 
forward, and her lips opened to let him in.  Putting a finger 
under her chin to tilt Mia's head back, Valerian kissed her 
deeply.  She met his increased pressure, not pulling away, 
welcoming but not pushing forward against his mouth.  She made a 
sound at the back of her throat that might have been a faint 
moan.
	"Thank you, Mia," he said as he pulled back, then added as 
she hesitated, "Go on."
	Valerian settled back into his chair as Mia's warm fingers 
opened the snap at the top of his pajamas.  He lifted his hips 
briefly as she slid the garment down his thighs.  He took another 
sip of brandy and closed his eyes as he felt the first feathery 
touch of her lips.  As she nuzzled at his middle, he popped one 
eye open to locate his cigar, took a puff and replaced it in the 
ashtray.  He groaned with pleasure as Mia's wet mouth enveloped 
him.
	As the wem worked on him, Valerian's thoughts drifted.  He 
remembered the moment he first saw Mia in the buyer's lounge at 
Elegant Companions.  She had slipped through the curtains of his 
booth wearing a long crimson dress in a style much like the green 
one she was wearing now.  She had stood, eyes down and hands 
clasped before her, just as she had stood near the door to his 
study only moments ago.  When he had said "Raise your head, 
child," she had lifted her eyes to his, and he had seemed to 
plunge into the dark pools.  He had known instantly that he had 
to have her.
	Mia's head lifted and lowered, sliding him in and out of 
her warm mouth.  She moved a hand up and wrapped her fingers 
around him.  She was not like Wendy, his previous favorite, who 
had performed vigorously,  greedily, seeming to take as much 
pleasure from the act as he did.  Mia took her pleasure from 
pleasing him.  She focused entirely on him.  She was worth her 
weight in gold, which was more or less what she had cost him.  
But well worth it, Valerian thought again, as he had reassured 
himself many times.
	His head lolled to one side and his half-open eyes drifted 
toward the wide chaise longue near the corner.  Part of him 
wanted to stop Mia, to rise and lead her to it, to strip the 
tight dress from her slim, elegant body, and to plunge himself 
into her depths.  Valerian groaned again.  The dominant part of 
him decided to stay right where he was.
	"That feels so good, pretty one," he whispered.  "Go ahead.  
Don't hold back.  Finish me."
	Without letting go, Mia shifted position, moving deeper 
between his knees.  She took him deeply into her throat, then 
pulled back and nursed at him more strongly.  Her fingers 
tightened around him and slid up and down along his length.
	"Ah, god!" Valerian moaned.  A wave of pleasure rolled 
through him.  He felt the tightening, the rising force in his 
middle that signaled his impending release.  No longer able to 
accept Mia's ministrations passively, he began to thrust his hips 
forward and back.  The slender wem was panting as she took quick 
breaths around him.  Valerian felt another and stronger wave of 
pleasure that washed up and over him, carrying him away.  He 
exploded in a pleasure only a few notches short of pain, groaning 
and making inarticulate sounds.
	Mia took the surge of Valerian's ecstasy without flinching, 
letting his thrusting hips drive him into her, gulping 
convulsively to swallow his fluid.  As he collapsed back into the 
chair, Mia continued to nurse at him.  Even small movements of 
her tongue sent electric shocks through him.  As Valerian 
relaxed, she laid her cheek on his thigh, holding him in her 
mouth, keeping him there with a gentle suction.
	It was several minutes before Valerian stirred.  As always, 
he was slightly embarrassed after sex without having the 
slightest idea why.  Now that the heat, the desire, had faded 
into satisfaction, he had awakened to a reality that was base and 
animal-like.  He was faintly disgusted with himself, especially 
his hairy, protruding belly, larger than ever it seemed.
	"Thank you, Mia," he said curtly.  "You may go now."
	Sensing his mood, Mia pulled back from him, planted a light 
kiss on his now limp member, and stood up, her eyes again 
downcast.  Valerian pulled his pajamas up, feeling embarrassed at 
his exposure.  As she turned to go, he called her name, and Mia 
looked back over her shoulder.
	"That wasn't much for you, I realize," Valerian said, 
somewhat awkwardly.  "Perhaps next time."
	"Oh, no, sir," Mia said.  "You mustn't feel that way.  It 
is my purpose to serve you.  It makes me happy to give you 
pleasure.  I hope I was... satisfactory?"
	Valerian smiled.  He was pretty sure Mia knew that she was 
much more than satisfactory.  It was part of the unspoken game 
they played.  "Quite satisfactory," he said, and thought he saw a 
brief smile of pleasure on Mia's lips before she turned and moved 
to the door.
	"Good night, sir," she said, making a slight bow.  Without 
having to look, her hand reached out to touch the door plate.  It 
swished open, then closed after her, and she was gone.  Valerian 
realized that he still held the brandy snifter in his left hand 
and marveled that he had somehow avoided dumping it onto the 
floor in the throes of his climax.  He raised it to his lips and 
took a large swallow, reveling once again in its taste and 
warmth.  His picked up his cigar, blew through it to exhaust the 
stale smoke inside it, then relit it.  He took a deep drag and 
sighed it out.  His life had never been better than it was now.

End of 'Valerian Smokes a Cigar' by Titmouse
Story 30


Author's Note:

Originally, I promised 29 stories, but that seemed an awkward 
number, so I've added this final one.  Although it can stand 
alone, it's actually the opening chapter of a longer story that 
I've worked on for several years, off and on, about future 
relations between humans and androids.  It's a topic that has 
fascinated me since my teenage enthusiasm for science fiction.  
With rare exceptions, however, science fiction at that time 
couldn't deal with what seemed to me to be the most obvious and 
likely use for artificial humans.

I won't post any more of this story because I hope some day to 
turn it into a commercial product.  It seems a fitting end to my 
series of posts, rounding the number up to 30.  I hope you've 
enjoyed them.  I'll be around, but at present I have no intention 
of writing more.  That particular itch has been scratched.
