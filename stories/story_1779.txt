 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lilly Fights and Bleeds - Marina Loves
it!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mr Marcelinus slipped away. A gentle
and kindly old man, he would sooner not see women fight. He knew that
blood would be shed and had no wish to witness it</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The two girls talked about Lilly.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Have you kept in touch with her,
Angelina?"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Oh, yes. She may have taken off like
a moon rocket almost as soon as we got home on her journey of self
destruction, but I hear from her every now and again. She hasn't
changed from the sixteen year old who walked out on her parents! Still
ready for a fight, still brave as a lion&nbsp; and still rebellious!
She toured fairgrounds for a while, challenging any woman to a bare
fist fight. Got quite a few takers! Mostly she won - almost always in
fact. But she had a few defeats and was put in hospital by one tough
lady who really took her apart!&nbsp; That bitch really went to town on
Lilly! Broke her jaw and her nose and cracked a cheek bone. To say
nothing of a few broken&nbsp; ribs. She finally knocked&nbsp; her out
after playing with her for the best part of an hour.&nbsp; Out for
twenty minutes! But the girl was right back in the ring as soon as she
had recovered! Took on the same woman later and had her revenge!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Then she joined a bare fist
underground fight club - overwhelmingly&nbsp; male of course, but with
a few like minded women, all very butch and hard as nails, like Lilly.
She toured the world with some of them until she finally struck out on
her own. That's what she's still doing - fighting and lapping up the
adulation she receives from sweet little things! Very girl oriented
these days is Lilly!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;She fell&nbsp; foul of one country&#8217;s
law in a big way. She was a bit vague about it but in her only letter
in two years she mentioned that she was doing a bit of time breaking
rocks again, building up muscle and getting another superb all over
suntan! So she obviously got herself a stretch on another chain gang or
some such arduous punishment! She seemed cheerful enough and taking it
all on the chin. Silly girl! One day she&#8217;ll learn! She sent me a photo
of herself a month ago, and she still looks lovely in spite of all the
fists that must have crashed into that face over the years! I wish
she'd stop it, though. I think she still feels guilt for Martha. I'm
afraid Lilly is looking for her own Lilly - the one who will end her
life!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Lilly is a heroine in this part of
the world! I&#8217;ve met a few of the people I knew in my days undercover
trying to get you out, and she&#8217;s still remembered here. They still talk
about her fights in the market place and how she never lost - even
against you! But I suppose you are right and this fight today ought to
be her last. Win or lose, she should retire soon. I rather think she
might, especially if you and I work on her. We'll talk to her after the
fight. I know poor devoted Karl still hungers for her. It would be so
nice to see her marry that guy and settle down."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Then the girl they had been discussing
arrived and climbed into the ring for her much awaited fight against
the island's female champion. It had been agreed to dispense with
boxing gloves. Bare knuckle fighter Lilly had never fought in them and
she never would. The crowd cheered when Lilly slipped off her gown and
revealed her naked body, once such a familiar sight in this square.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"I'd forgotten, Angelina, just how
hairy it's possible for a woman to be! Gross! But she's wonderful,
isn't she! Look at that stomach! Most men would be proud of abs like
that! And my thighs are thinner than her arms!" Marina's heart had
missed a beat when that body was revealed! Lilly had put on weight in
the last three years - all of it solid muscle! Talk about
impressionable young teens falling for her! Marina felt herself going
wet already, unshaven legs or not!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Yes." said Angelina "After three
years I'd also forgotten how an unshaven woman looks, even though I
worked side by side with plenty for so long! I don't mind her
pussy&nbsp; being hairy! I think her cunt should be that way if she
still insists on fighting in the nude - there&#8216;s a heck of a lot of it
and it&#8216;s best kept at least partly hidden! It&#8217;s juicy succulence gave
me a lot of comfort once, mind you! But the legs and the armpits!
Please!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"I'd have thought her back would have
healed up much more than that after over three years, but it still
looks terrible!" said Marina in a puzzled voice. "I wonder?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lilly's opponent, Donna, took off her
gown and she was dressed in shorts and a sleeveless top, but barefoot
like the completely stripped Lilly. The bell went and Lilly and Donna
went into action. By the end of the first three minute round the two
girls realised that Lilly had lost none of her skill and power, in fact
she was more fearsome than ever! But the other woman was no slouch and
Lilly's nose was bleeding slightly and her body showed where Donna&#8217;s
bare fists had slammed into her, as she went back to her corner.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"It's going to be a great fight!" said
Marina. "And I wouldn't necessarily bet on Lilly! This could be her
Waterloo! That other girl is something else! I bet she&#8216;s pretty
fantastic when stripped!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"I agree. And she has age on her side.
Although Lilly's still only twenty one - that&#8217;s not exactly ancient!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In round two Lilly opened the
proceeding with a straight left jab that hit the other girl a glancing
blow on the cheek.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Mistimed that badly! She'll need to
sharpen up - and fast!" muttered Marina.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Donna didn't mistime her first shot!
Lilly looked stunned for a split second and then let loose a blistering
right cross and drew blood from the other woman's nose.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Broke it! Lovely shot! Broke it
badly, too!" commented Marina. She was loving this! After three boring
years as a sales manager, she was ready for a bit of excitement and
Lilly was providing it!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The other girl tried to stay out of
trouble after that but Lilly pursued her and landed a dozen blows in
fairly rapid succession. Despite her dark complexion Donna's face
showed plenty of damage as the bell finally went.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Lilly's round" commented Marina.
"Don't write Donna off, yet, though. That girl's plenty mad and she's a
fighter. Don't be too cocky, Lilly!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Round Three saw the first knockdown as
Lilly was caught by a wild swing that had little skill behind it but
plenty of power. Marina could see that her friend was not hurt. But
Lilly wisely took a count of nine. Lilly had a red mark on her right
cheekbone and looked worried. Marina prayed that her friend would not
be disgraced in front of a crowd who all willed her to win, even if she
was not the local girl.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Marina went for Donna's body for the
rest of the round. Just before the bell Donna punched Lilly hard in the
gut, five inches below where her belt would have been if she had been
clothed. She grinned evilly at Donna and replied in kind! Donna dropped
to the floor in agony and the bell went. Lilly walked back to her
corner and Donna was assisted to hers.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Honours even" said Marina to
Angelina. "Donna won't be trying any more low blows. Lilly has a
stomach like iron and fists of steel!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lilly put Donna down in Round Four and
was about to do so again when the bell went. But Donna had landed a few
good blows that made Marina wince as they crashed into Lilly's face,
ribs, stomach and breasts. Lilly&#8217;s body was red and her ribs bruised,
but she looked calm as ever, and concentrated. How those breasts looked
to good after all the punishment they must have sustained&nbsp; over
the years was a mystery. Marina's own figure was definitely sagging
more than a little these days and Lilly looked tremendous! After the
fight, she must ask her how she did it!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Both women traded punches in Round
Five, making no effort to evade the other's fists. It was a war of
attrition and Marina was unable to decide who was winning. The paler
skinned Lilly was looking decidedly pink! Donna was hurting her!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Nobody's round" she whispered. "Donna
is tough. Maybe as tough as Lilly! This could go on for ages! Great
stuff! Are you glad you came, darling!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Yes and no, Marina. I hate to see
Lilly get hurt. I just wish this was over. And I'm going to persuade
the silly girl to call it a day. She'll be brain dead in a few years if
she doesn't stop!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Marina nodded. But she didn't agree.
All her words to Angelina about getting Lilly to retire were forgotten!
She couldn't wait for the next round to start! And she no longer cared
who won! It was just such a great fight!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In Round Six the pair continued to
slug it out and Lilly ended with a very bloody nose, as did Donna, who
must have been in great pain with her broken nose and bruised ribs. But
Donna seemed happy to trade punches like this for as long as Lilly
wanted!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Still too damned close to call! Wow!
What a fight! Can those two take it! And can they dish it out!&#8221;
enthused Marina. But Angelina didn't look so happy!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In Round Seven both girls were
floored, Lilly going down just before the bell.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Lilly's tiring! If she can't do
something soon, she's had it!" said Marina. "Come on, girl! Don't let
us down!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lilly didn't let them down. Round
Eight was all hers. Donna looked a terrible sight when it ended with
her mouth bleeding and her nose spurting blood all over both herself
and Lilly.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In Round Nine Donna came back and
pounded Lilly all over her body, slamming her hard in the ribs a dozen
times. Lilly winced in obvious agony, but stood her ground. She
answered with fewer punches, but they were telling ones to the face.
Donna's ruined nose was pouring blood as she went back to her corner.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Wonderful round for Donna! A few more
like that and Lilly would be done for! But it's come too late. Donna's
started losing too much blood. They&#8217;ll have to stop it. Damn! I was
loving it!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And they did stop it. Lilly was
declared the winner and the two fighters embraced and kissed.</span><br
