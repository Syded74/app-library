fic: two weeks notice

A/N and all-purpose disclaimer: Written for reel_merlin, for the movie prompt of the same name. If you've seen the movie, you'll recognize the bits I took from it. I also lifted a few select lines from the show. Also, I blatantly stole a bunch of other stuff, which I will list below:

-All but one of the Demotivational posters that Arthur and Merlin use to flirt harass each other are from despair.com, because they're hilarious. (The one containing the line "Vanish from my sight, peon" is from rageprufrock's Three Castles, and had to be used because it is one of my favorite fanfic lines in the history of ever.)

-The vegetarian joke mug is copyrighted as well, but I have no idea where I got it from.

-Silver spotted skippers are a real endangered butterfly in Britain, and I thought the name was hilarious so I used them. Sadly, they do not actually feed on the Mortius flower.

-The butterflies became an unexpected symbol/metaphor/allegory for Merlin and Arthur and how their relationship changes them both. I really can't quite figure out how that ended up happening, because I just look at this and think 'Ahahaha! I can't believe I actually tried to insert something deep and </i>symbolic</i> into this mindless drivel!'

-The 12-foot penis flower is a real endangered plant. As soon as I read about it, I knew I had to mention it in this fic.

-There is a very tiny allusion to syllic's WIP Easy There. See if you can spot it.

-Also, I'm afraid I have Merlin channeling Ianto for the coffee thing (though, honestly, that could also just be me projecting my coffee!love onto Merlin). I don't know how that happened. I don't read Torchwood fic.

*ducks rotten fruit and potatoes*

-I have no idea where the ridiculous, Tardis-like-coffee-machine-of-teh-sex came from. I apologize for its silliness.

-There are multiple references to Doctor Who, some more explicit than others. The first person to spot them all wins a cookie. *g*

-merelyn and krazykipper, though I did not sign up for Bring It On, I did manage to work that particular catchphrase into the story. Thank you so much for hosting this spectacular challenge, and for extending the deadline so that those of us who were frantically trying to finish despite the ignominious deaths of our laptops did not die of deadline-induced strokes and/or heart attacks. (Oh, that was just me? Well, thanks anyway, then.)

-Super thanks to sandrainthesun for the absolutely gorgeous coverart. You are amazing darling! \o/

-ETA: I completely forgot to mention that the idea of Arthur in glasses was 100% inspired by this completely amazing piece of fanart by trolleys!!!

-Huge thanks to the people who helped me cobble together songs for my soundtrack, after my computer's death meant I lost the original. emptybackpack, kelene, downloadable08, and everyone else who offered. You are all spectacular.

-Major thanks to my entire flist for putting up with my constant whining and also supplying me with ideas and endless encouragement during the many, many times that I got stuck while writing this. In particular I'd like to thank the people whose contributions I shamelessly stole for this fic: lavvyan, merelyn, beadattitude, bakarini, kelene, el_gilliath, and everyone else who contributed whose ideas I never got around to using. You are all wonderful, wonderful people, and if I used one of your ideas and forgot to include you, I'm sorry. Please let me know and I'll add you to the notes!

I have no idea how this got so long. 37,616 words? SERIOUSLY, WTF? I honestly don't think there's enough plot in this to justify that kind of word count. Hopefully its length does not drag all my readers into near-comatose states of boredom, because that would REALLY, REALLY SUCK.

Also, as long as you're reading this, you should all check out the soundtrack, which in my opinion is better than the fic. IDEK how that happened, but I blame it partly on the fact that my version of Arthur sucks at emoting and can only get in touch with his feelings by using Morgana as his emotional proxy, and partly on the fact that 78% of this fic is shameless self-indulgence.

And last but certainly not least, much love for my fantastic betas, siobhan_w and feathergirl89, who bravely took on the task of beating this monster into submission and putting up with my panicked deadline-induced ravings, who very politely pointed out when I was making up words and when I complete failed to sound British, who were infinitely understanding when I was having laptop ISSUES and also when I lost my entire fic because my dog ATE MY USB DRIVE and they had to send me the sections they had saved to their files so I could cobble it back together. Seriously, this fic would not be half as good as it is without your invaluable input. You both deserve SAINTHOOD. I have no idea how I would have done this without you.

Two Weeks Notice: Author's Notes 

And I don't even like Ianto all that much.
