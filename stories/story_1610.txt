              Now take my brother for instance.  Ray Bullock is one of those types which is both<BR>
              good and lucky.  He had the luck to have gotten all the good looks to be had,<BR>
              genetically, from our parents, and he got Dad's common sense to boot.  But he didn't<BR>

              impression of a rugged, handsome rebel type, and on me it makes people wonder<BR>
              whether I'm retarded or not.  Ray got dad's powerful, broad body, and I got mom's<BR>
              sickly, weak one.  And in terms of brains?  Everything I got out of that deal was the<BR>
              result of a hard-learned lesson.  Everything I have which passes for intelligence is really<BR>
              only the sum of thinly disguised cynicism and suspicion.  But I'm not complaining.  I did<BR>

              Two week's ago, Ray died.  He was right in the prime of his life.  He was a myth in<BR>
              the making, and now, his is the legend which will never be finished.  When he died, he<BR>
              was rated number 24 on the list of the most influential businessmen in America.  And if<BR>
              you can remember back to last year's 'Sexiest People' issue of <SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle5">People </SPAN>magazine, you<BR>
              may be able to put a face to the name I'm going to attribute to his wife: her name was<BR>
              Annataszia Killyan.  Annataszia Killyan-Bullock officially, but without the hyphen<BR>
              whenever she appeared before the camera.  She was rated in the top 10 as far as sexy<BR>
              <SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle5">People </SPAN>went that year, number eight to be exact.  She had just come off a year in<BR>
              which she'd had a #1 box-office hit called <SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle5">I'd Like You to Watch</SPAN>, the cover of the SI<BR>

              What did I have?  A career as an actor which barely qualified me as 'starving.'<BR>

              Stop.  You might have the wrong idea from all of this.  What I need you to know is<BR>
              that I hated Ray Bullock.  I resented him.  I was jealous of him in nearly every way you<BR>
              can imagine.  I'm really glad he's dead.  When I turned on the ten o'clock news the<BR>
              other night and saw that glitzy little video-obit for him, I probably felt a little bit like Lex<BR>
              Luthor would seeing that Superman had died.  I ran to the kitchen for a beer so I could<BR>
              toast my good fortune: one less thing to goad my ulcer with.  When I got back to the<BR>
              TV, they had a full-body picture of his widow, wearing a black, micro dress, weeping<BR>
              by his graveside.<BR>

              Well, that's when the gears first started turning.  The sight of Annataszia, breasting<BR>
              out of a dress the size of a handkerchief, with fresh grief glistening on her cheeks, is a<BR>
              sight to get the blood of any healthy man pumping.  My mentality just at that moment,<BR>
              watching her on the screen, was in a state somewhere between horny and sympathetic<BR>
              -- treading the line on both sides -- and I had just had a brainstorm.  A brain hurricane,<BR>

              It's true that I never kept tabs on my brother.  As far as I was concerned, taking<BR>
              the time to say hello to him on the phone was more trouble than it was worth.  But you<BR>
              must remember he and his wife were media magnets.  All I ever had to do to find out<BR>
              what was new in his life was turn on the TV, and flash! there he was.  Full close-up, his<BR>
              massive head, filling up my house with silver-blue television light.  Ray Bullock, so big<BR>
              and omnipresent you could count the pores on his nose if you had the mind to.  And of<BR>
              course all the stories that made the news were the trashy ones.  The ones a sensible<BR>

              Annataszia had a screen put over the mirror above her antique, Russian vanity<BR>
              when she learned there were jealous spirits living inside its reflections.  Annataszia<BR>
              always consulted astrologers before photo shoots so she could minimize her exposure<BR>
              on days of &#34;high cosmic incidence.&#34;  Annataszia had her and Ray's house totally<BR>
              redesigned so it would be more in harmony with the Oriental Chi -- Feng Shui: put<BR>
              stairs over there, hang up another mirror, we need a crystal.  Annataszia once guest<BR>
              hosted <SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle5">Sightings.</SPAN>  Those are the highest ratings that show will ever get, and it has<BR>

              my brother's life, and replacing him like an actor's understudy.  Maybe I didn't have all<BR>
              the looks and charisma of my brother, but I had other tools in my possession by which<BR>
              to accomplish it.  I had an intimate knowledge of Ray's childhood, his same cross-bite,<BR>

              too?  &#34;If your husband were still alive, he'd probably be sending his chauffeur to give<BR>

              hypnotically swaying, like a pocketwatch on the end of a chain.  She was wearing a<BR>
              short, short skirt that was as tight as a coat of paint, and there were no panty lines<BR>

              &#34;Oh, Ray,&#34; she said.  &#34;No.&#34;  She got up and came over to me.  She turned the chair<BR>
              I sat in away from the table, so I was facing her, and knelt before me, taking my hands<BR>

              She let me undo the remaining buttons of her blouse, and slip the material down off<BR>
              of her shoulders.  I was careful to make every touch seem like a miracle for me: like I<BR>
              really was a dead man, adrift in his memories of love.  I caressed her like she was a<BR>
              sacred relic.  I fondled her like she was a jewel.  Her body responded with shivers and<BR>
              goosebumps.  She was uneasy.  I could sense her tension.  But underneath it, I could<BR>
              also feel her excitement.  It was something new for her.  Something kinky.  A cold<BR>
              touch of the forbidden, but she was warming to it.<BR>

              As she was on her knees, I too got down on my knees, sliding out of my chair, and<BR>
              coming down, eye to eye with her, all the while continuing to touch her, light, light, soft,<BR>
              soft.  Reverent.  Then I kissed her: on the lips, on the throat; and wrapped her up, like<BR>
              she was a gift; my arms and fingers were ribbons and bows.  I ran my hands up into her<BR>
              hair and savored the glossy smooth texture of it.<BR>

              Even up to then, she had made no movement to indicate she would return my<BR>
              affection.  She had only allowed me to do what I would without resistance.  It took<BR>
              quite some time before her attitude changed.  Don't get me wrong here.  I was going to<BR>
              have her, by that time, one way or the other; whether she got into the spirit of the<BR>
              occasion or not, but such was my desire to win her over with the skill of my lovemaking<BR>
              that I took extra special care -- attentive and patient -- with her that first time, hoping to<BR>
              get a response from her.  Up until the moment when her appetite was sufficiently roused<BR>
              to cause participation, I had nibbled at her with my mouth and fingers; gentle and<BR>
              encouraging.  Teasing her lips and her ears and her nipples.  Tickling her along her<BR>

              Then the magic happened.  She sighed, a satisfied sigh, and arched her back, and<BR>
              all over her body stiffened, so that she was suddenly like the carved idol I was treating<BR>
              her as.  She whispered my brother's name, &#34;Ray.&#34; And then my nibbling was done.<BR>
              Then I was devouring her.<BR>

              Our bodies tumbled and twined together like blankets and bedsheets.  We were<BR>
              like pure, liquid love; no skeleton or physical form to inhibit us.  I ripped her skirt to<BR>
              shreds in my haste to be at her, and she popped the buttons and zippers on my<BR>
              garments as well.  When, at last we were both totally naked, there was not the slightest<BR>
              lessening of the frenzy that was upon us.  We were both insane for pleasure.<BR>

              I had never engaged in the act of giving a woman cunniligus, but I had a taste to do<BR>

              sealed a violently passionate kiss between the lips of my mouth and her vagina.  On the<BR>
              receiving end of pleasure, I, likewise, felt her, warm and wet, suckling me.  We rolled<BR>
              and crashed against each other, like waves on a shoreline, and we continued until our<BR>
              bodies were sore from the awkward position.  Then I reversed, mounted her, and<BR>
              plunged myself, like a sword into a sheath, and she fit me like that too: tight and precise.<BR>

              vanished.  All thoughts of patience were gone; replaced with urgent need.  We<BR>
              pumped, and bumped, and jostled.  Her subtle, quiet sighs were abandoned for more<BR>
              expressive grunts and moans.  It was no longer love we were making, it was sex.<BR>
