Gracie sighed as in resignation when they arrived back at the palace.   How had she ended back up where she had started?   She had to accept the fact that she was going to end up married to Rand.  But she had to decide how much to give to him.   If she gave him her heart and soul, there would be nothing left for herself.  Especially since she knew that Rand wouldnt be giving her the same in return.   

Opening the car door, she grimaced and walked to the entrance of the palace.  Her father stood on the steps waiting for her.   He had a frown on his handsome face.   She knew that she had embarrassed him by fleeing but if she had to do it over again, she would still do the same thing.   Stopping in front of her distant father, she waited for him to speak.

Grace OConnor, Im very disappointed in you. He said quietly. 

I figured as much, Dad.  She said calmly, vowing not to explode in front of her father.   

Since when does an OConnor turn tail and run? He asked her as he took her arm and led her into the palace.

I know, Dad, OConnors stand and fight. She stated as he drew her into his office.

Then, why did you?  He asked as he sat down at his desk.  Sit. He ordered.

 No, Dad.  I dont think I will.  Gracie stated.  Rubbing the back of her neck, she faced him.   And decided it was time to set a few things straight with her domineering father.  Walking over to the bar, she pulled out crystal decanter and poured him a finger of scotch.   And decided to help herself to one too.

Gracie, dont you think its early to be drinking?   Colin asked her.

No.  You want to have this out?  Fine. Lets have this out, Dad.  She said as she walked back to her father.  Handing him his glass she walked over to the floor length windows.   Staring out into the gardens, she paused to gather her thoughts.

Well? Colin asked as he grew impatient with the silence.

It is this simple, Dad.   Ill marry Rand.   I have no choice in this.   As usual when the royalty decrees something, it is as good as gospel.  But it doesnt mean that I have to be happy about.  She stated as turned back to her father.  You know I had never planned on marrying.   I was happy just the way I was.   I had my studies, a good job, and a best friend that I wouldnt trade for anything in the world.  

Gracie, surely you knew that one day the prophesy would come true? He said as he watched his daughter pace back and forth in front of him.

Prophesy.  What a joke? Well, the joke is on me this time.   In one fell swoop of the pen, Dad, you stole my life from me.   You knew how I felt about the prophesy.  You could have simply told Rand that I wasnt an suitable candidate to  be his bride.

I wont lie, Gracie.  You were the most suitable match for him.  Colin said warily, not liking where the conversation was heading.

Well, lets hope Im as suitable as you think.   You know in this bargain Dad, that I stand to loose more than I could ever hope to gain?   My studies are done, my job? I wont be working anymore.   And the biggest lose will be my best friend.   How the hell, Dad, did you think I could possibly convert my best friend into my husband?  She asked angrily.  Nothing will ever be the same between us.

Grace!  Her dad protested, coming to his feet.

Sit down, Dad. She said coldly.   Ill do my duty to the prince.   Ill share his bed, and throne.  But as for my heart.  Well, lets just say, I intend to keep that to myself.  She said as she sat the glass down on the edge of his desk.   Turning she walked calmly from the room.   She didnt even bother to acknowledge the stone faced man, standing by the door.
****************************************************
Rand stared in disbelief as he watched her slowly climb the stairs.  Entering Colins office, he shut the door behind him. 

Prince Rand. Colin said with a quick nod of his head.

Do you realize what you done?  He asked as he leaned on Colins desk.

Randall, I will speak to my daughter anyway I see fit.  Colin said defensively. 

Your daughter will be my wife, Colin. Im in love her.  Next time, before you jump on her, try to put yourself in her place.   Right now, she is trying to accept the fact that I wont let her go.  She doesnt understand it.  Then throw in the burn of the mezclar which is totally alien to her.   Hell, even I have problems dealing with the burn and I have been told how it will be.  Rand said softly.

But its still her duty.  Colin said fiercely. 

And duty is not going to be able to prepare her for the reality of our bonding. Rand explained.  And your words of condemnation arent going to help matters. Do you realize how hard Im going to have to work now, for her to let me into her heart?  He growled.   Today, Colin, you did me no favors.  
*********************************************
Gracie stood silently on the balcony outside her room.    She was so tempted to simply levitate over the rail and disappear again.   But she knew herself, and she knew that she would not be able to resist the wild call of the mezclar.    Already she was feeling the effects of being around Rand.   She knew that he was in the next room.  She hungered for the touch of their minds.  But Rand had been surprisingly silent since they had returned from the motel.  Who would have thought that she would feel so alone?
**********************************************
Rand stood in the next room.   He was deeply aware of her every thought and movement in the room next to him.   But as on edge as he was, he knew that he couldnt be trusted.   He was ready to say to hell with the formal wedding and take Gracie to the nearest minister.  He knew that Jonathan was tired of playing referee between him and Gracie.   And lord only knew what his father thought about the whole situation.  There was a knock on his door.  Turning towards it, he told the person to come in.   He was not surprised to see his father stride into the room.

Pack a bag. the king told him.

What?  Rand asked wearily.

You heard me.   Grab enough to last you until your wedding.

Where are we going?

Away from here.  The only way that you will keep a level head and not attack Gracie is to put some distance between you.  So write your Gracie a note and lets get out of here.  The king said coaxing his son.   Ill even deliver it for you. he added on.    

Sighing, Rand scribbled out a quick note for Gracie before handing it his dad.
Give me ten minutes to clean up.  He told his dad.
*************************************************
Gracie was still fuming when she received a note from Rand.   Dare she open it?  It had Rands familiar chicken scratch on the front.   Well, how much worse could it be, she asked herself.   After tearing it open, she realized exactly how much worse it could be.   Damn that man, she fumed as she headed for his open door.
There was no way in hell he was gonna take off and leave her here by herself.
*************************************************
Rand was in the shower, when suddenly the shower curtain was ripped back.  Turning, he realized that Gracie was not happy about his note.   Whatever she was about to say to him, he saw was lodged in her throat.  

What? 

Damn you. She hissed. Why do you get leave and I dont?

Because of this!  He growled before yanking her into the shower with him clothes and all.  Spinning her around he pressed her up against the side of the shower and his hard body.   Gracie gasped.   He took advantage of it, thrusting his tongue inside her mouth as he ground his hips against hers.  When his head finally lifted, he stared down at her.    Im leaving to keep this from happening. 

Oh. She whispered as her lips throbbed gently from his kiss.

Im gonna tell you one time, Gracie.  Then I want you to get the hell out of my shower.    My dad is taking me away until the wedding.   To keep this from happening.  He stated firmly, pulling her hand down his hard body he placed it directly on top of his distended manhood.  This is what happens every time I am near you.  Hell, even if youre across the room this happens.  I cant control it. One of these times, Im gonna loose my head.  So Im leaving.  Now, take that sexy ass of yours back to your room, or I swear to God, Ill take you right here and now.  He growled as he stroked her hand across his hard flesh one more time.  Then pushing her hand away, He stepped back from her.

Rand? She asked, her voice reedy with desire.

Run. He told her as he took a step towards her.  

I dont want to. She whispered.  Let me do this. 

Gracie?  He gasped as she dropped to her knees in front of him.

Relax, Rand.  You decided you wanted me for your bride.  So now youll have to deal with me.  She told him before taking the head of his erection into her moist mouth.

NO! You cant do this.  He growled, lifting her up and wrapping his arms around her tightly.  

Why not? I want to.  She asked, almost on the verge of tears.

Im sorry, Gracie.  I just cant. he groaned against the top of her wet hair.  I cant break tradition.

Damn your tradition.  She hissed as she tried to jerk free of his hold.

Now, calm down! he told her tensely. 

Let go of me. Gracie hissed between her teeth. 

No.  Not til you calm down, damn it.  He growled.

I said let me go.  She repeated, squirming and trying to slip away.
Grace, I swear to god, if you dont stop that right now, Ill do something well both regret.  He said resisting the urge to shake her.

Like what?  Youve taken my freedom, my dream of being your advisor, and your friendship away.  What else can you do to me, Rand?!  She shouted at him.

Damn you! He growled as he shoved her away from him.  Get the hell out of here!  Stumbling she backed away from him.  She had never seen him so angry before.

Why? So you can run away? So you dont have to deal with me?  She asked hotly.   Ill tell you something, Your Highness, I think you are a coward.  She finished.  Spinning around on her heel, she stormed out of the shower.   As she reached for the door, it slammed shut in her face.  A growl came from behind her.
But she had already thrown caution into the wind and was to angry to care if Rand was angry too.

Who was the one that ran away from me, Grace?  Who is the one that has been fighting our nuptials, since the very beginning? Who is the one that triggered the mezclar?  He growled as he pinned her face first against the bathroom door.

I was.  She hissed.

Thats right, Grace.   You were.   Im at the end of my rope here and it wont take much to push me over.  Im very close to saying screw it.  He growled. 

Youre ready to release me then? She asked almost in tears. Have I pushed back hard enough, Rand? Will you back off now?  Rand paused and his anger cooled.

I wont ever back off, Grace. He told her as he gently nipped her shoulder.  Youre mine and youll always be mine.  Youve been mine for over ten years.

Im not an object to own, Rand.  She gasped.

I didnt say you were.  I said you were mine.  Just as much as I am yours. he said as he nuzzled side of her neck. We complete each other.

Its beside the point, Rand. Ill see you in a couple days. She said softly before releasing the spell he had placed on the door.
**************************************************************
Grace stood on her balcony and watched as Rand and King Mica exited the palace grounds.   Looking up at the stars that were starting to appear in the night sky, she wondered where to go from here.   Today had been the first real fight that she and Rand had ever had.     

Should she just continue on as normal?   Take advantage of their marriage?  The intense sex?  She had no doubt it would be.  But what was it without love?  It looked like it was how she was going to spend the next thirty years.  Providing, of course, that the sex didnt fizzle out before then.

Gracie, are you in here?  Turning, Grace saw her sister standing in the middle of her suite.  

Out here, Patience.  She called out.  Grace turned back to watch as Rand and his father disappeared from sight.  She already felt the tug of loneliness.  

Im coming back, Rands voice whispered in her head. Ill see you at our wedding, Gracie.  You better be there, he finished.

Where else would I be, she asked, you have me bound to you so tight that you couldnt slip a piece of paper between us.

Damn, straight, he chuckled. Ill see you tonight, he whispered.

Maybe, she taunted.  

Everything okay? Patience asked her as she came to stand beside her.

No.  But only time will tell. She said turning towards her.  How is the thing with Jonathan coming? 

Slowly, but hes almost there.  Patience responded.   Only wish I could initiate the dream merge. He hasnt touched me since that first time.  Id love to be able to surprise him.    Grace had a sudden thought.   

You know, Patience, I can help you with that.  She said with a smile.

Really, how?  Patience asked as she stared off into the distance.  

Stay here with me tonight.  And well attack him together.  Gracie said mischievously.   

How?  She asked excitedly.

Easy.  Ill wait until youre asleep.  Ill merge with you.  Then well merge on Jonathan.  Ive merged with him before, so hell not fight me.  Even if he did, theres still a slim chance Id win.  He wont hurt me.  Gracie said teasingly.

Will he realize Im there? Patience asked.  

Thats going to be the pleasure of it.  Im gonna drop you right in his bed and then disappear.

Wont I disappear with you? She asked.

No.  Once the dream merge is accomplished, hell take control of it.   Then the rest is up to you.

Can I have him tied to the bed? Patience joked.

Well see. What will you give me?  Gracie teased as she darted back into her room.   

Grace OConnor.  You get back here! her sister hollered.
******************************************************************
Rand was surprised when they stopped in front of a lab. Looking over at his father he waited for him to explain.

This is a friend of mine.   His father and I go way back.   He is going to let us use his cabin until your nuptials.  King Mica said as he got out of the car. Rand followed him.  

When they walked in the front door, they were greeted by a pretty receptionist. Rand smiled absently at her.   She smiled at him before turning to his father.

Good evening, King Mica.  Drew is back in the lab.   Go ahead and go back. Alexa said with a nod of her head.   

Thanks, Alexa.  He said as he walked down the hall.   Rand turned his attention back to the woman sitting behind the desk.

Known my father for long, Alexa?  He asked pleasantly.

No, not really.   My brother, Drew, petitioned to get a marriage license for himself and an off-worlder.   Our father knew yours.  Served under him in militia.  He had nothing but good things to say about him. She said with a smile.
*************************************************************
King Mica paused before entering the lab.   Both scientists were working at their lab desks.   When he cleared his throat, the woman glanced up first.   

Hello, King Mica.  Grace said softly as she rose to her feet.   Walking over to her lover, she tapped Drew on the shoulder.   As usual the man was emerged in his work.   Drew, the king is here. She told him.

Your Highness. Drew said scrambling out of his chair. He made a quick bow to the man.  I have the keys for the cottage right here. He said as he fumbled for the key ring in his pocket.   When he couldnt find his ring, he frowned.   

Looking for these?  Grace asked softly with the keys in her hand.

Yeah, how did you get those?  Drew asked with a smile.  

I locked the apartment this morning. Remember? She said with laugh.   Handing them to him, she wandered back over to her desk and sat back down.  Smiling, he nodded as he took the keys to the cottage off his ring.   Handing them to the King, he walked over to the door with him. 

Drew, you never introduced me to the lady. Mica said softly.  

Oh yeah.   Grace come here.  He said over his shoulder.   Muttering about interruptions, Grace stood and walked back over to the pair.

King Mica, this is my bonded, Grace.  Grace, this is King Mica.  Ive petitioned him about getting a marriage license. 

Nice to meet you, Your Highness.   Grace said softly.  

Grace, huh? King Mica chuckled.  You know Im about to have a new daughter named Grace.  We call her Gracie though.  But Im sure youre as delightful as she is.  Turning to Drew, he smiled.  Come see me about that petition after Rand gets married, son and well see about getting you two married.

Thank You, your highness.  Drew said as the king turned to leave the room.

No, thank you.  When Drew looked bewildered, he added. For the use of your cottage.
*************************************************************
Later that night, Gracie kneeled next to her sisters sleeping body.  It had taken forever for her sister to drop off.  The excitement of what she had proposed to do had kept her sister wired.   Taking a couple of deep breaths she entered her sisters dream.    She walked over and gently shook her.    

Dont wake completely up, sis.   I just need you awake enough to follow me. she coaxed her.   

Okay.  Patience mumbled and left the bed she was sleeping in.   

Alright, now hang on to me, sis. Grace said before she started blurring the edges of the dream.    When the edges went back to normal, they were standing in a dimly lit room.    She could hear groans coming from the bed.   And so could her sister.   Putting her finger to mouth to let her sister know to be quiet, she edged over to Jonathans side.  She was not shocked to see her sister under him. Walking back over to her sister she smiled.  Then whispered softly, Dont worry, sis.  Hes just having an erotic dream.   I had this happen once with Rand.   The moment that you lock eyes with the woman over there, youll become her.  So be prepared for the onslaught of sensations. Just then behind her the couple climaxed on the bed.  Or wait til he finishes and go rape him. She whispered. Turning she watched the woman on the bed curl up on top of Jonathans heaving chest.   Just before her sister headed over to the bed, she stopped her. 

Do you still want him tied up?  She asked her.

Yes.  Patience whispered back.   With a wave of her hand, Grace made it so.
************************************************************************
What the hell? Jonathan growled, when he realized that he was restrained.  Then the woman on top of him lifted her head and smiled. 

Hello. She whispered softly and smiled into his shocked face.

Patience?  How?  He gasped as he struggled to free his arms.

My sister.   Thanks, Gracie. she called over her shoulder.   

Youre welcome.  Have fun.  Graces voice floated over to them, then was gone.

I cant believe that you are here. Jonathan whispered.  Untie me, Sweetheart. he urged.

Nope.  She said with a chuckle.  I think I like you just the way you are.

Patience!  He warned.  

This time, its my turn.  She told him as she leaned forward to kiss him.

Wait... He protested but was silenced by her mouth covering his.  She loved the taste of him, she decided.   And it had been too long since she had last tasted him.   She sighed with delight as she felt him strain against his bonds.

Relax, Im not going to do any thing that you havent done to me. She whispered in his ear before exploring the inner curves with her tongue.   Jonathan gasped as pleasure ran down his spine.  If only he could get free.

Patience smiled wickedly as she continued down his throat to the crook of his shoulder.   She couldnt resist.   She took the skin there in her mouth and started to suck.   She smiled happily when Jonathan cursed softly.

Just remember Patience, turn about is fair play.  He growled.  

What do you mean? she whispered after she lifted her head.

You have to untie me sometime. He growled in return.	Damn it, you better not have left a hickey.  

Whatcha gonna do if I did?  She asked as she slid down his torso.  
Oh, you little minx. He growled as her hair trailed across his stomach.  He nearly pulled his arms out of their sockets when he felt her warm mouth envelope his hard cock.  

Patience could hardly believe her daring.  She would have never dreamed of doing  this to Jonathan if her sister hadnt given her the courage to try.  He was a very powerful man.  One that intimidated her the from the first time she had met him.  She had stood in Graces shadow for so long, she hadnt know how to go about attracting a man of his statures attention. 

Jonathan groaned even louder and pulled harder on his bonds when the little tease between his legs reach up and gently cupped his balls.    Damn, he thought, I dont want to come without her.   But if she kept up her teasing it would be over before it even began.   He sighed with relief when she lifted her wet mouth away from his aching erection.    

Come here. He gasped.

Why? she whispered as she slowly stroked him.

You know why, you little tease.  He groaned as she settled herself over his hips and aching cock.  

Damn, Im already wet. She whispered to him as heat filled her face.

Let me see. He begged, eyeing her lower torso.  Bring that beautiful pussy up here.  She gasped before slowly crawling up his torso to hover over his upper chest.  

There. She whispered.  Can you see it now?  

Bring it closer. He said with hunger in his eyes.   Whimpering she tilted her hips forward so that she was almost straddling his head.  On bring that pussy down here. he ordered.  I wanna taste.   Patience did moan this time as she felt his tongue trace the outer edges of her labia.  Relaxing her thighs she sank a little closer to his playful tongue.   

Jonathan groaned as he buried his tongue in her moist slit.  Damn, this woman, that he had chosen, tasted wonderful.   He couldnt believe that he had gotten in the predicament with his beautiful Patience but he wasnt going to complain.  But he was going to be true to his word.   Next time that he saw Patience, she owed him one.   And he intended to collect.   

Patience could feel her orgasm coming but she didnt want to climax this way.  She wanted to be filled full of her lovers hard cock.   And with her sisters little gift of bondage she could do exactly as she pleased.   And Jonathans superior strength wouldnt be an issue.   Pulling away from his talented mouth she gasped as she teetered on the edge of orgasming.   Taking a few deep breaths, she tried to regain control of her body.

Bring that pretty ass back up here.  Jonathan growled.  I wasnt finished. 

No.  She said as she slid back down his torso.   I want more.  

You little minx.  He growled.  Just wait til I get loose.  

Why?  Are you going to punish me?  She asked as she positioned herself over him.

Hell, yes.  Im gonna eat that little pussy until you beg me to stop.  He growled as she slowly slid herself down onto his cock.   Throwing his head back, he groaned.   

Like that, do you? she whispered as she fully seated herself on him.  

Hell, yes.  Now move that ass.  He growled as he lifted his hips off the bedding.
Gasping, she did as he asked and started to move on him slowly.  As the pleasure started to race through her body, she quicken the pace.    It wouldnt be long now, she thought vaguely, as she continued to bounce up and down on her lover.

Jonathan groaned as he watched her breasts sway each time she lowered herself on him.   Damn, he wanted to touch those breasts and lick them.

Patience, untie me.  He growled as he fought against his restraints again.

Not yet. She muttered as she crept closer to the edge of release.

Please.   I want to hold you.  He gasped.   

After. She gasped as her release started to break over her.  Leaning down she fastened her mouth on his as her release exploded through her lower body.   Jonathan growled into her mouth as he felt her pussy squeeze him tightly.   He arched his back and thrust his hips up against hers as he felt his own release approaching.   It crashed over him as he felt Patience run her fingers through his hair. 

Son of bitch! he growled before throwing his head back against the pillow.   

Thats it.  Patience gasped as she continued to move on his exploding cock.  Fill me full.   

When the last of the spasms left them, they laid tangled together.   Jonathan was still restrained but he was still basking in the glow of his powerful orgasm.   Patience laid across his chest, trying to catch her breath.   
Sweetheart, untie me please.  He whispered against her ear.  Nodding sleepily she tugged his bonds free before dozing off on top of him.
***********************************************************
Jonathan awakened and sat up in bed.   Reaching over for his robe, he shrugged into it and then left the room that he had been assigned at the palace.   With Rands wedding so close, he had decided to stay at the palace to be close.   And now he was glad had chosen to stay.  

Walking down the hall, he stopped at Gracies suite of rooms and knocked on her door softly.    He wasnt surprised when Gracie answered the door.   

Where is she? he asked softly.   

In the guest room sleeping.  Gracie said with a yawn.  Im not surprised to see you though.

I bet not.  He said as he stopped in front of the closed door to the guest room. That wasnt very nice of you, Gracie.  Wait til I tell Rand what youve been up too. 

Gracie laughed.   She could just imagine how that conversation would go.
Do you think he might find it humorous that you were bested by two women?  

Like I told your sister, Gracie.  Turn about is fair play.  Maybe Ill have to do the same to you.  Leave you tied to the bed for Rand to find.  He said with a grin.

You can try.  She told him.

That might just be worth the time and effort.  Jonathan said before opening the guest room door.   You mind if I crash here?  Or do you want me to move her to my room?  

No, go ahead and crawl in bed with her.  Im sure shell be happy to find you there when she wakes up.
