              Randy, at one time a Marine, had most recently been employed by a guerrilla outfit<BR>
              in Colombia for the purpose of instructing others in the techniques of explosives, and<BR>
              providing an example in physical fitness and nutrition.  His two heroes were Richard<BR>
              Marchinko (the Rogue Warrior), and Jack LaLane (the eighty year old exercise guru),<BR>
              and at age fifty-eight, Randy Quentin looked like he might one day own the fitness<BR>
              king's records.  His chest was three and a half bowling balls wide, his arms bordered<BR>
              on the edge of normal-or-steroid-induced reality.  His head was shaved, but he had a<BR>
              meticulous goatee, the same gun-metal gray color as his bushy eyebrows.  He had a<BR>
              necklace made of a fine link chain which all the slugs that had ever been removed from<BR>
              his many combat injuries were hung on, and, on his body, right next to the scar left by<BR>
              each one, was a tattoo of the date which commemorated the occasion.  Each of the<BR>
              bullets on the chain was inscribed with a corresponding date.  Save for one, each of his<BR>
              scars could be matched up with a bullet from his chain; that one, he explained, had<BR>
              been caused by a lemon shark, but then offered no further explanation.<BR>

              Every morning, Randy would run forty laps around the manor's grounds, then he<BR>
              would retire to the room he'd had outfitted as a gym and lift weights for three solid<BR>
              hours.  After his ritual workout, he would eat one bowl of oatmeal, sweetened with<BR>
              honey from a chunk of raw honeycomb, and drink a glass of fresh-squeezed orange<BR>
              juice with an egg in it.  Randy loved his job, and having him on board was great for<BR>
              morale.<BR>

              Kiss was a different kind of character all together.  At the interview Eliphaz asked if<BR>
              she was superstitious at all and her reply had been, &#34;Why walk under a ladder if you<BR>
              don't have to?&#34; Her specialties were martial arts and close combat weapons: knives.<BR>
              Eliphaz said to her, &#34;You know, the word nekro comes from the Latin for death.  Your<BR>
              name could be taken then to mean, the Kiss of Death.&#34;  And she said, &#34;I don't have any<BR>
              reputations I haven't earned.&#34;<BR>

              All the same, she would've been just one of the faces in the ranks of normal security<BR>

              Kiss was a small woman, fragile-looking and loin-achingly attractive; when she first<BR>
              reported for duty, heads turned.  Her body was so lithe and perfect, her hair so wild<BR>
              and black; her eyes were so dark, and her lips so full...  Several men approached her,<BR>
              but each was shot down before they'd even managed to introduce themselves.  Kiss<BR>
              said, &#34;I have no desire or need for the company of a male in my life.  Leave from before<BR>
              my sight before I make your genitals into a key chain.&#34;  But still, there was one man<BR>
              who persisted; got to the point of forcing himself on her.  So she stabbed him to death.<BR>
              She stabbed him eight times, each time with a different knife, leaving the previous one<BR>
              lodged firmly and deeply in his body.  All eight blades were in him before he even hit<BR>
              the ground.  Then, she <SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle7">did </SPAN>make his dick into a key-chain.<BR>

              Eliphaz respected that, and truthfully, so did every one else.  Her actions were the<BR>
              subject of many whispered conversations behind her back that day.  Greggory's first<BR>
              thought was to have her dismissed, but Eliphaz dissuaded him.  He said, &#34;That is one<BR>
              tough woman.  That's the kind of thing you look for in a personal bodyguard.<BR>
              Tenacious.  Aggressive.&#34;  So she became one of Greggory's private guards.  And<BR>
              Greggory was afraid of her.<BR>

              So too, it seemed, was Coldlove.  The dog was usually seen taking shelter from<BR>
              Kiss, positioning himself so that his master's legs were separating him from her.  Any<BR>
              time she spoke his name he would whimper and cower.<BR>

              But Eliphaz himself was not worried until it came to his attention that Kiss' mind<BR>
              was blocked off from him.  At first he figured it was because he wasn't focused, but<BR>
              when she caught him staring with the effort once, and gave him a little, crooked, viper-<BR>
              like smile, he began to have his doubts.  He said to Randy, &#34;Never leave Kiss alone<BR>

              The four of them had a meeting about house security.  Eliphaz, Greggory, Randy<BR>
              and Kiss, gathered around a round table the like's of which would have been straight<BR>
              from the legends of King Arthur.  Coldlove was at Greggory's side, enjoying a<BR>
              scratching behind the ears.  They discussed mainly escape routes -- how to get<BR>
              Greggory quickly and safely out of the building.  Eliphaz had a plan for nearly every<BR>

              Randy: &#34;You certainly have invested a lot in security here.  I understand it's all in the<BR>
              interest of protecting Mr. Clefferts, but what I'm not clear on is why he need this much<BR>
              protection, and what it is we're protecting him from.  I've tried to imagine different<BR>
              circumstances, but nothing I can come up with justifies all this trouble.  Perhaps you<BR>
              could enlighten me.&#34;  He always presented his words in a careful, unhurried way.  His<BR>
              eloquence and soft-spoken nature were part of his image of cool.  He never seemed<BR>

              He gave plenty of time for someone to answer him, but when no reply seemed<BR>
              forthcoming, he continued, &#34;I understand it's not my place to question the motivations of<BR>
              my employer, but it seems to me that kind of professional courtesy can only extend so<BR>
              far.  Too many unanswered questions lead to distractions; loss of focus.&#34;<BR>

              Eliphaz cleared his throat.  &#34;You make an excellent point, Randolph.  Mr. Clefferts<BR>
              and I hoped that an explanation would be unnecessary, but perhaps the curiosities of<BR>
              our circumstances are overwhelming.&#34;  It always amazed Greggory, the way Eliphaz<BR>
              could emulate the behaviors of another person's speech.  Here he was, nearly a<BR>
              manners mirror in his dealings with Randy.  With most of the other guards he was a<BR>
              tough, sailor-mouthed, slave driver.  With Kiss he was dangerous sounding, and his<BR>
              words were filled with innuendo.  And he made his switches without anyone ever<BR>
              seeming to notice.  He was a social chameleon -- so charismatic he made Hitler seem<BR>

              &#34;Perhaps the best way to describe what we hope to accomplish is as a thwarting of<BR>
              destiny.  You, doubtless have had questions regarding the unusual appearance of Mr.<BR>
              Clefferts, yet these you have, most admirably, managed to suppress.  Maybe you have<BR>
              qualms about his taking offense at your comments, should he be disabled or<BR>

              Most of the time, when Greggory went for a walk, or did something else outside of<BR>

              matter of coincidence either; Greggory was careful to schedule such wandering<BR>

              Randy was good company.  Conversing with him was a pastime that Greggory<BR>
              found surprisingly enjoyable.  He had never thought of himself as being someone who<BR>
              would have something to say to a soldier, but as it turned out, with Randy, there was<BR>
              little noticing that he was a career military man.  Randy didn't talk about himself so<BR>
              much in terms of what he had done as he did about where he had been, what he had<BR>
              seen, the people he had met, and what he had learned of other cultures.<BR>

              One day, a rambling tour of the grounds found them on the upper-most observation<BR>

              gently sloping domes of green, and beyond, fields, those cultivated and not, contrasting<BR>
              against each other like squares on a checkerboard, stretching off to the horizon.  In the<BR>
              far, far distance, there were storm clouds, lying on the ground like a swollen bruise.<BR>
              The tops of those clouds were flickering, blazing blue-white every now and again, and a<BR>
              sound, like a big cat purring, came rolling off them after each pulse.<BR>

              &#34;When I was at the end of my second tour in Vietnam,&#34; Randy said, out of the blue.<BR>
              His eyes were on the clouds; way off, and dreamy looking.  &#34;I was going through a<BR>
              newly captured village with my troop.  We'd been tipped off to the fact that the village<BR>
              was a cover for the VC.  Apparently, it was some kind of security leak inside the<BR>
              village that got the information through to us; and apparently the VC found out about<BR>
              that leak the same time as we did.  By the time we got there, they'd already moved out.<BR>
              But as a punishment on the villagers, they'd killed all the women before they left.<BR>
              They'd killed all the women, and then set all the farms on fire.<BR>

              had been destroyed.  I remember walking through that village, with all those haunted<BR>
              faces looking out from the shadows under the doorways, and all those eyes...  All those<BR>
              people.  Hating us.  Because we were the ones who had brought it on them.  No use<BR>

              &#34;I got to the far side of the village, though, and there were three young guys.  Our<BR>
              boys.  They looked barely old enough to enlist; didn't even need to shave more than<BR>
              once a week yet.  Two of 'em were throwing baseballs out to some of the village<BR>
              children, who were running around in a field.  It wasn't a field for crops or anything, so<BR>
              it was still mostly intact.  Full of grass and weeds about knee high.  The third of those<BR>
              boys was just standing there, like he was studying something.  He was smoking a<BR>
              cigarette.  His eyes were all squinted down like he was concentrating real hard, but all<BR>
              he was doing was just standing there, watching those children in the field.<BR>

              never stopped to think about why they were doing it.  I never stopped to wonder about<BR>
              why their aim was so far off.  Why they made those kids chase after so many bad<BR>
