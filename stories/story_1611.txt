              On my wedding day, at the reception, surrounded on all sides by friends and<BR>
              relatives and loved ones, I met a man that I had never met before, and have never seen<BR>

              Cassie was dancing with my little brother, Jason, who had just turned twelve, the<BR>
              baby of my family.  Jason was blushing furiously, embarrassed both by close contact<BR>
              with a girl and from being the center of everyone's attention.  Everyone had either an<BR>
              &#34;oh,&#34; or a laugh on their lips.  It was a real Kodak moment.  I remember that moment<BR>

              &#34;Yes.  Oh, for sakes, my family, we were so grieved by the tragedy.  Especially<BR>
              when we later learned that Marrianna was pregnant with his child.  Nothing tears at the<BR>
              heart like a young widow with a baby, you know?  She was a courageous mother, but<BR>
              it was still kind of pitiful.  Kind of sad.  A kid needs a father, you know what I'm<BR>

              made a withered, sandy noise against his dry, stubbly skin.  I thought he was probably<BR>
              done with his story, so I backed a step away, hoping for a quick, clean separation, but<BR>
              I didn't quite put enough distance between us.  &#34;Mary never would accept any help<BR>
              from any of my family.  She had a lot of pride.  She was a strong woman, I'll give her<BR>
              that much.  My mother, and her sister, my aunt that is, offered to help her out on many<BR>
              occasions, but Mary wouldn't have any of it.  She was an outsider, a loner; everything<BR>
              she did, she did on her own.  We never really knew much about her after Daryl died.<BR>

              The day Cassie and I moved into our house is another one high up on my list of<BR>
              fond memories.  It seemed to me to be the finishing touch on the project of my success.<BR>
              Thirty-four years old, I had a career as a future partner in my law firm, I was making a<BR>
              six digit salary, I had my health, I had the singular most beautiful woman in Western<BR>
              Civilization for a wife, I had a Mercedes, and now, I had my house.  The only things<BR>
              missing were children and a good dog.  The children would come (children are a natural<BR>
              by-product of being married to the most beautiful woman in Western Civilization).  The<BR>
              dog was another situation all together.  Cassie preferred cats; cats and birds and<BR>
              rodents.  Rats, mind you, were fine, but dogs were out of the question.  Still, even<BR>
              minus the dog I dreamed of someday having, I was happy.<BR>

              it was like the beginning of a whole new life.  Here was a perfect space, empty and<BR>
              waiting.  Waiting for me to fill it with my things, my family, and good memories.  I took<BR>
              a couple of minutes there at the threshold, mostly excited, slightly overwhelmed, to<BR>
              explore the magical feeling of the moment.  The sense of personal history in the making<BR>

              ...and set down in my bedroom; my new bedroom in my new house, and Cassie<BR>
              was there.  She was shocked to see me in the state I was in, soaked and chilled to the<BR>
              bone, my clothes dripping.  Her lips moved but no sound came out.  She came to me<BR>
              and began to undress me.  I saw that outside the bedroom window it was night, and<BR>
              floating in that night were three pairs of eyes.  Icy blue eyes, like Cassie's.  They<BR>
              watched with great interest as Cassie first stripped me to my underwear and then<BR>
              wrapped me in blankets.  All the while she seemed to speak, but I heard nothing.  She<BR>
              caressed my forehead.<BR>

              I was warming rather quickly; feeling was returning to my fingers and my toes, and<BR>
              they burned painful hot.  But even as some parts of my body were just beginning to<BR>
              thaw, others were warm already, as though heated by fire.  I wanted very desperately<BR>
              to make love to Cassie just then, and I could see in her eyes that she knew this.  She<BR>
              reached inside the blankets with one hand and I felt that hand slip under the waist-band<BR>
              of my shorts.  She fondled me.  I stiffened.  A soft, pleasured gasp slipped from my<BR>
              lips.<BR>

              Then, quite suddenly, all the pleasure was pain and I felt warm wetness, alarming in<BR>
              quantity, oozing between my legs, and I knew it was blood.  My toes curled, and my<BR>
              knees locked and my thighs were seized by hot, clenching cramps.<BR>

              Cassie was looking me straight in the face.  In her eyes I saw raw, unsorted<BR>
              emotions -- confusion.  Her mouth was a tiny, thoughtful frown.  Somehow, through the<BR>
              pain, I felt her hand leaving me.  When she pulled that hand out of the blankets it was<BR>
              balled into a fist and dripping red.<BR>

              Cassie held one finger from her clean hand up to her lips as though to shush me.<BR>
              While doing this I saw her slowly open her crimson fist.  And it was filled with babies.<BR>

              Hundreds of tiny babies, each one probably no bigger than a ball bearing, yet I<BR>

              She leaned towards me then, and pressed her lips onto mine.  But it was a kiss full<BR>
              of malice.  She began to inhale and I realized the air was being sucked from me.  I had<BR>
              a brief vision of my lungs collapsing like tubes of toothpaste whose contents were being<BR>
              squeezed out.  Darkness was coming to greet my wide and staring eyes.  The last thing<BR>
