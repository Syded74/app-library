    <i>Gracie, its time to get up.</I>  Rands voice whispered softly through her mind.

    <i>Go away.</i> She told him as she snuggled deeper into the pillows.

    <i>If I have to come in there, mi reina, you will not like the consequences</i>.

    Go away, Gracie said without opening her eyes.  She could feel his presence near by.  More than likely it was coming from next door.  She hadnt slept very well the night before.  Her dreams were filled with erotic images, and all of them were of her soon to be husband.

    <i>Dont want to.  I want to slide inside that tight little body of yours.</i>

    Gracie opened her eyes with a groan. <i>Wasnt last night enough for you?</i>

    <i>No.  I want every inch of you under me, Gracie.  Loving each other until we cant see straight due to the fire building between us.</i>

    <i>Rand, please.  No more.</i>

    <i>Im going to give you more until your body cant hold any more.  Then Ill give you every single inch of me.<iI>

    Gracie arched her back and sat up in bed.   Her breathing was accelerated.  Damn, that man, she thought. <i>You wont be happy unless you have me panting after you.</i>

    <i>Damn straight, I want you to want me as much as I want you.  I wont settle for less.</i>

    * * * * *

    Gracie was sitting in her room, eating breakfast when her mother and father appeared in her door way.  When they moved further into the room, Gracie realized that her Aunt Clara was standing behind them. 

    Good morning, Grace, Clara said.  I have met your young man.  He is indeed everything I hoped he would be.  I have a feeling that you two are going to set the night on fire with your passion and love of each other.

    Good morning, Aunt Clara she said, unwilling to say more.  She wouldnt dignify her aunts assumption with an answer.

    Why arent you get ready?  her mother scolded.

    Mom, I have several hours before the wedding.  So why get dressed up.  Its not as if Rand is going to care about what Im wearing.

    <i>Id rather have you naked under me.</i>

    <i>Stop it.  My parents are here, my aunt is receptive to your thoughts too.</i>

    <i>I dont care if she hears.  You are my chosen. We will bond tonight.  Then the </i>mezclar<i> will take over and well be as one.</i>

    Gracie leaned her head back and slowly counted under her breath. The man was going to drive her insane.   Her mother walked over to her and placed a calming hand on her shoulder.  

    Relax, Gracie.   Your big day is here and let me pamper you,  Eve told her daughter.  Now, I ve hired someone to come and do your hair and nails for the wedding.  My treat, sweetheart.

    Mom, you shouldnt have, she protested.  Just then there was another knock on her door.  Turning towards, it Gracie hoped that Rand would stride through it.  She hadnt laid eyes on him since before she had been kidnaped.   At the cottage all she had seen was smoke and fire.

    <i>I wish I could, Gracie.  But you know what would happen.</i>

    <i>Damn it! Stay outta of my head, unless you have something important to tell me,</i> she growled.

    * * * * *

    Sitting across from his father, Rand couldnt help but chuckle.   The tremors were still rippling across his powerful frame but he knew hed be okay.   King Mica looked up at his sons laughter.

    Whats so funny? he asked.

    Gracie.   She just tried to chew me out. Told me to stay out of her head. If I thought she meant it I would be hurt but shes just as testy as I am today. Mica just shook his head.  He could remember those days.   He didnt begrudge his son at all.   He was glad he had done his time with the <i>mezclar</i>.

    Dad? Rand said as he jumped out of the chair. I feel like Im gonna jump out of my skin.  Lets go to the gym.

    The gym? King Mica asked.  Okay. You want to go to the gym, lets go.  Standing up, he walked over to the door of his office and opened it.  Looking down the hall both ways, he motioned his son to follow him.

    * * * * *

    William settled down in his seat.  He was glad that he was on his way home.   Glancing around the plane he noticed that it was mostly empty.  Probably due to the princes wedding.   Then a man sat down next to him.   Glancing at over at him, recognition hit William.  He had seen this man before.  The man turned and gave William his full attention

    Hello, William, the man said quietly.  The boss wants to talk to you.

    Im going home, he told the man.

    If you dont come with me I can guarantee that your mother will receive you in small pieces, the man told him softly.   William cursed under his breath.  Guess he wasnt out of this mess yet. Unbuckling his seatbelt, he got up and followed the man back down the aisle.

    * * * * *

    William waited nervously as the boss came into the room.  When the man finally walked through the door, he cringed.

    William.  Where were you going? the boss finally asked him.

    Home, he told him.

    I see. And Princess Deanna.  What of her? 

    She is bonded with her cousin, Charles, William said sadly.  She wont be of any more help.   Shell be lucky if the Prince doesnt imprison her and Charles, William said truthfully.

    I see. Turning he looked over his shoulder at the man behind him. It looks like well have to find another avenue of pursuit to over throw Prince Randalls kingdom.  Turning back to William, he smiled. And you, Will, are going to help me.

    All I want is to go home, he protested.  I dont want to die. 
     
    The man smiled evilly.  Then I suggest you do as you are told or I will kill you.

    Gracies Suite

    Eve watched with misty eyes as her daughter stood with her back presented to Emma.  The maid was slowly tying the intricate ties on the back of Gracies wedding dress.  

    To Gracie, the soft brush of her maids hands against her back were torture.  Every inch of her skin was on fire. The <i>mezclar</I> was burning in her veins.  Taking deep breaths she tried to control her racing heart.   She hated feeling like this.   The last two days had been like this and every moment seemed to last an hour.   Her mind was a chaos of need.    Rand hadnt touched minds with her since she had scolded him earlier.   Damn, she needed the contact but her stubborn pride wouldnt let her give in and be the first to give in.

    <i>Gracie?</i> Rands voice whispered softly.

    <i>Rand.</i>                        

    <i>Hang in there.  Soon well be together.</i>

    * * * * *

    Rand gritted his teeth as he fought to control the tremors that were wracking his frame.   They had only grown in intensity as the day had wore on.   As his trembling fingers attempted once again to pull his hair back with a leather thong, he nearly screamed.   As the small piece of leather hit the floor once more, Jonathan walked into his dressing room.  

    Jonathan stooped down and picked up the hair tie and took a good look at his best friend.   He noted the tremors immediately.   He could tell that Rand was on the verge of overloading.   This was not a good sign. 

    Here, Jonathan said handing it to Rand.   Who promptly lost it again when his trembling fingers wouldnt close around the small object.

    Son of bitch! Rand growled as it fell to the floor once more.

    Just leave it down, Jonathan suggested.  Its not going to matter to Gracie if your hair is pulled back or not.

    You dont understand, Jonathan.  It is customary for the bride to loosen the grooms hair during the ceremony,  Rand said hoarsely.

    Fine.  Give me the damn hair tie.  Ill pull it back for you.   As he briskly pulled his friends hair back, he continued to talk.  Does your father know that you are in this bad of shape?

    No.  I sent him to be with Mom.   She was having some last minute issues with the caterers.

    Screw the caterers.  How are you going to make it through the ceremony with out attacking her?  Jonathan asked as he ran the comb through the long ponytail at the base of his friends head.

    I dont know, Rand groaned helplessly.  I feel like Im on fire.   And shes the only thing that can put it out. 

    Enough of this,  Jonathan growled as he headed back to the door.  Sticking his head outside the door, he hollered at someone in the hall.

    A few moments later, King Mica and Queen Aria came rushing into the room.  When Mica saw the state his son was in, he was concerned.

    How long have you been like this? he demanded.

    All day,  Rand gritted out between clenched fists.

    You are almost out of control, Rand.  We need to get your wedding over now. Mica told him. 
     
    Turning to his wife, he continued. Aria, go fetch Gracie and her parents.   We have to preform the ceremony now.  

    But what about our guests?  Rand croaked as he tightly held himself, trying to control the tremors.

    Well have a private ceremony in our chapel and video tape it.  Then well broadcast it later tonight,  King Mica decided.  The <i>mezclar</i> will wait no longer.

    * * * * *
     
    Eve was surprised when Queen Aria stormed into the room and looked around wildly for Gracie.

    Wheres she at? Queen Aria demanded.

    In the bathroom,  Eve said.  The queen hurried over to the bathroom door and knocked briskly.  Gracie?  There was no response from behind the door.   Finally the queen tried the door knob and opened the door.   She walked into the bathroom and found Gracie huddled in the corner, sitting on a vanity chair, trembling. 

    <i>Mica, send Jonathan to Gracies quarters.</i>

    <i>Whats wrong?

    Gracie is in worse shape than Rand.  I need someone to help me get her to the chapel.

    Alright, love.  Jonathans on his way.  Meet us there with Gracies parents.

    Fine.</i>

    * * * * *

    Jonathan, go and help Queen Aria with Gracie.  Ill take Rand down to the chapel and get the minister there, the king ordered.

    I can do that, Jonathan said as he darted out of the room, instinct telling him that something was not quite right.

    Now, son, lets go down to the chapel and wait for her,  Mica told his son.

    Alright.  Is Gracie okay?  Rand asked as another violent tremor seized him.

    Shell be fine, Mica reassured him.

    * * * * *

    When Jonathan, Queen Aria, Gracie and her parents arrived in the chapel, King Mica had the minister and Rand waiting at the front of it.   Colin wrapped his hand around his daughters waist and slowly guided her up to the alter. 

    The minister watched as the kings advisor guided his trembling daughter to the alter.   As many of these weddings that he preformed he had never seen such a couple as close to the edge as the two young people in front of him.  

    How long have they been in the grip of the <i>mezclar</i>? he asked the king.

    Almost two weeks. the king replied softly. That is why I have asked you to preform the ceremony here.  Well tape it and then broadcast it later.   These two probably wont make it down the aisle before they lose it.

    I understand.  Ill make the ceremony quick but beautiful. The priest told his king. Turning to Jonathan, the priest questioned him.

    Do you have the required items?  he asked.

    Yes, Jonathan told the minister. 

    Alright, the minister said loudly. Lets get this marriage done.  About that time, Colin stepped forward with his daughter.  Standing between the two as was customary, he joined their hands and held them in his own.  On the right of him, his daughter gasped and to the left of him, Rand growled deep in his throat. 

    I know.  Colin told them softly enough that the vid cams wouldnt pick up his comment.   Just for a moment, he promised them.

    We have come here today to join, these two in royal matrimony.  The duties that Rand and Gracie have chosen to take on, has been determined through much reflection and has been predestined through the ages.  Who gives this woman to this man?  the priest asked.

    I do,  Colin said clearly.

    And who gives this man to this woman? the priest asked.

    I do, Queen Aria said standing at her husbands side.

    May I have the bindings? the priest asked Jonathan.   On silent feet, he moved forward and handed the delicate looking bindings to the priest.  I bless these binding to hold and join Gracie to Rand, and Rand to Gracie.  The minister said in a solemn tone.   Taking the binding the priest interwove it around both of their joined hands.

    Gracie gasped as she felt the binding settle in place.  Now, there was no way for her to escape. 
     
    <i>What am I doing?

    Calm down, Gracie.  I wont let anything happen.

    I dont want this.

    Like hell, </i>he growled. <i>You want this so much that youre ready to jump out of your skin.  I can already feel your body readying itself for mine.

    Rand!

    You realize, Gracie, that once this over, the wait is over.  Im going to love you until you cant walk and then Ill love you some more.   I just hope that I dont hurt you in the process.

    Hurt me?

    Yes, I know that you are a virgin.  Ill try to take it easy on you but I cant promise that I wont hurt you.  Just be patient with me, Gracie and Ill more than make up for any pain I cause.

    What do you mean, you know Im a virgin?

    Its the royal decree, Gracie.  No royal may marry unless they are untouched.   I just hope I have enough self control to take my time and not ruin it for you.  Im just as untouched as you are.

    You rat!  You mean if I lost my virginity, I wouldnt have to go through with this wedding?

    There was no other choice but to go through with this wedding, Gracie.  You are mine and Im yours.  No other man will ever touch you and no woman will ever touch me.  That is the way of chosens.

    I dont want to be your chosen, damn it.

    Thats too bad.  You are and Im gonna love you until all you can think about is having me inside of you.</i>

    Colin felt the sudden tension grip his daughter.  What ever was going on between these two was very strong.   The damn minister needed to hurry and finish this before one of them lost control.  Catching the kings eye, he communicated the urgency for the minister to hurry. 

    Hurry, the king whispered to the priest.

    Turn and face each other, the priest told them softly.  
     
    Turning, Gracie glared at her husband to be.   She didnt know if she was more angry at him or more aroused by being in such close proximity to him.

    <i>Oh you may be angry with me, Gracie.  But I know that under all that anger is a desire so hot that youll burn with me until we both rise from the ashes.  Damn, I want you under me.   I want to kiss those magnificent breasts and then roll over and have you ride my cock while I nibble on those dark nipples.

    Knock it off,</i> Gracie whispered as the desire that had been barely leashed tried to break free.

    <i>No, Im going to knock you up,</i> he promised. 
     
    Gracie moaned softly. 

    Gracie, to show his utmost faith and trust, Rand is going to allow you to free his hair for his kingdom to see.   And I know you know the significance of his gesture.  No wizard is allowed to wear their hair free until after they have bonded with their chosen.   Rand, please kneel in front of your bride, the priest finished.  Rand did as the priest asked and knelt in front of Gracie.  

    Gracie swallowed roughly as she stared at the tie at the nape of Rands neck.  Dare she touch him?

    <i>Release it

    I dont know...

    Just do it Gracie.  Ive longed to feel your nimble fingers run through my hair.</i>

    Holding her breath, she did as she was asked and untied the thong that held his midnight hair restrained.  Her knees almost gave out when she ran her fingers through his soft hair.  Pleasure shot through her as she tried to pull her fingers away.

    Rand smiled up at her as the pleasure flowed from him to her.  Coming up from his knees he once more towered over her.

    May I have the amulets? the priest asked.  Both Colin and Queen Aria stepped forward with them.   The amulet has always been a symbol of each wizards or witchs power.  In exchanging these amulets, Rand and Gracie, are giving each other control over their power and their commitment to one another.   Turning to Rand, he handed Rands amulet to him.  Place this over Gracies head and repeat after me.  the priest told him.  I, Rand, entrust this woman with my heart, my soul and my powers.  To hold and protect forever. 

    I, Rand, entrust this woman with my heart, my soul and my powers.  To hold and protect forever, Rand repeated, every word echoing through his heart.  Then he placed his amulet over Gracies head and settled it gently against her bosom.

    The priest smiled softly and then handed Gracies amulet to her.  Gracie, its now your turn.  Place this amulet over Rands head and repeat after me.  I, Gracie, entrust this man with my heart, my soul and powers.  To hold and protect forever.

    Gracie swallowed before slowly repeating after him.  I, Gracie, entrust this man with my heart, my soul, and powers.  To hold and protect forever, she finished softly, tears glistening in her green eyes.  Bowing his head, Rand leaned down enough so Gracie could place the amulet on him.

    <i>Youll never regret it, Gracie.

    I better not.</i>

    After he straightened up, he smiled at her.  The mezclar was still clawing at him viciously but the fact that his amulet glimmered softly against her breast, was enough to leash the savageness that was attempting to claim him. 

    I, now, declare that Rand and Gracie are as one in holy matrimony.   What I have joined together let no man or wizard ever part,  the priest finished and turned them to face their families.   

    King Mica smiled happily before leaning down and giving Gracie a kiss.

    Welcome to my family Gracie. You are a most welcome addition.  And you have made my son a very happy man today, he said so softly that Rand couldnt hear him.  Turning to his son, he gave him a hug.   Go give your mother a kiss and take your bride to your rooms.  You will not be disturbed until the mezclar has run its course.  Just remember do not untie your bond.   Come to me and I shall break it when the time is right.  He reminded his son.

    I know, Rand said as he returned his fathers hug.   Leaning over he kissed his mother. Thank you, both, he told his parents.

    *****

    Rand opened the door to his suite and brought Gracie into the room with him.  Not that she had much choice, she thought.  The damn binding made sure that she followed him everywhere.

    Gracie, sweetheart, look at me, Rand said softly after he shut the door.

    Why? she growled. Youve gotten what you wanted.

    Not yet, I havent. he replied as the fire burned brighter in his system.

    Fine, take what you want, then leave me be, she said hotly as she pulled as far away as the bindings would let her.

    There will be no taking in this room, Gracie.  Only giving.  Im going to give myself to you and you are sure as hell gonna do the same for me, he growled.

    Make me, she taunted.

    Oh Gracie, you shouldnt have done that, Rand said softly before making all her wedding finery disappear.

    Bastard.  Two can play at that game, she hissed just before stripping him in the same manner as he had her.   Rand growled before lifting her off her feet.   Walking to his bed he tossed her down on it and immediately covered her naked body with his own.  Get off, she growled.

    I will, he promised. When Im done.
