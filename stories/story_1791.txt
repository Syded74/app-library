<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harriet got out of bed next morning and left Gwen fast
asleep.&nbsp; She went out to continue working,&nbsp;&nbsp; after first
getting herself something to eat from the kitchen&nbsp; (bacon and eggs
and sausages and mushrooms and all manner of other unhealthy things), hoping&nbsp;
that the excellent Jenkins would not mind her intrusion into his territory.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The cold was as intense as ever but the wind had dropped
off.&nbsp; Without Gwen working by her side, it was a slow business and
the metal boxes were not full until mid-morning.&nbsp; She carried them
over to the site of the rockery and tipped out the contents. After yesterday
night's epic struggle she was tired and sore, but forced herself to carry
on until lunch-time.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>As&nbsp; she made her way back to the house, she reflected
that yesterday's fight had been her fourth contest&nbsp; only the first
that she had won, after a string of defeats.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only that,&nbsp;
it had also been by far&nbsp; the longest and most brutal,&nbsp; and horrifically
painful, although at the time she had felt nothing in all the adrenalin
charged excitement of combat.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>There ought to be more civilised ways of settling differences
than this, she decided, and made up her mind never to lift a violent hand
against another again.&nbsp; It would not be her style any more, she resolved.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwen was still asleep when she went up to her room
and Harry with infinite care and gentleness,&nbsp; turned the dear girl
over onto her side.&nbsp; She saw properly for the first time the damage
that that loathsome woman had done to her.&nbsp; She went over to the dresser
and started pulling drawers open and searching through them.&nbsp; Finally
she found what she was looking for and brought the bottle of Mrs Travers
magic lotion over to the bed and started gently rubbing it into those bruised
but still beautiful buttocks.&nbsp; She could hardly believe&nbsp; the
damage that Janet had inflicted on that sweet girl and when she saw it,
she changed her mind about violence.&nbsp; That woman had got got what
she deserved and if she, Harriet ever saw her again,&nbsp; she would give
her such another beating-up as would make the first seem mild by comparison!</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>She&nbsp; lovingly turned Gwen onto her front,&nbsp;
went over to&nbsp; a cupboard and brought a sheet and a blanket over and
laid them&nbsp; carefully over Gendoline's still sleeping form.&nbsp; Tired
herself after her morning's work, and still in great pain after last night,
she slipped into the bed beside her friend, enveloped, for once,&nbsp;
by&nbsp; the comfort of bed coverings.&nbsp; She gave out a contented sigh
as she&nbsp; felt Gwen's lovely animal warmth against her own flanks, breathed
in the scent of that beloved body next to her and fell asleep.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>It was three before she woke to find Gwen had got out
of bed and gone to get&nbsp; something for them both to eat.&nbsp; They
lay together, the tray in front of them and had their first meal together
since that rather uncomfortable Sunday dinner, yesterday.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Harry bit off a piece of boiled egg, took it out of
her mouth and popped into Gwen's.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"She did a lot of damage to that sweet rear of yours,
Gwen.&nbsp; Why did you let her do that to you in your own home?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"She was kind of blackmailing me, Harry.&nbsp; Not
for money, that didn't interest her.&nbsp; If I didn't let her do what
she liked with me, she was going to tell Jim about our affair and I can't
bear to lose him.&nbsp; She told me I was going to get fifty on my bottom
for being hard on you last week - just any old excuse was good enough for
her.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to stay perfectly still and count - you must have
heard.&nbsp; If I moved or didn't shout loud enough,&nbsp; she started
again.&nbsp; She was getting more and more frenzied, Harry and kept telling
me I'd moved or wasn't counting out loudly enough.&nbsp; It went on and
on until you and Jenkins came.&nbsp; It was pretty bloody horrible, I can
tell you!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"You silly girl, Gwendoline!&nbsp; Jim knows all about
you and Janet - and you and Jessie - and you and me!&nbsp; He might not
like it, but he accepts it.&nbsp; He knows you're&nbsp; wild, self-willed,
capricious and utterly out of control and he loves you for it.&nbsp; He
wouldn't have you any other way, you&nbsp; fool!&nbsp; You suffered all
that abuse from that wicked bitch for nothing!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I hope you're right, Harry.&nbsp; I hope you're right."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Course I'm right!&nbsp; Now let's see that old, lovely
confident Gwen back again!&nbsp; Let me feel the lash of your tongue like
I did last week!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I'll never order you around again, darling.&nbsp;
If you want to stay on here and help out, I'll be most grateful - over
the moon, in fact -&nbsp; but we're equal partners from now on, and that's
an order!&nbsp; And another thing, my darling.&nbsp; I said before that&nbsp;
if I can ever help you out of a hole, I will.&nbsp; I say&nbsp; it again
now.&nbsp; I'd count&nbsp; it a sacred privilege&nbsp; to be able to give
my own life to save yours."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Don't be so over-dramatic and morbid, Gwendoline!&nbsp;
Neither of&nbsp; us is going to die for the next seventy years!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I hope not"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>They spent the rest of Monday, after finally leaving
the bedroom, sitting looking out of the dining room window at the rolling
expanse of lawn and at their miserable, girlish efforts on the new swimming
pool.&nbsp; They had no wish to go out into the cold again.&nbsp; Gwendoline
took the cushion away from under her buttocks after an hour or two and
gingerly lowered her bare and battered rump onto the wooden seat.&nbsp;
She breathed a sigh of relief.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"That stuff of Mrs Travers&nbsp; works wonders, Harry!.&nbsp;
I've lost all the soreness already.&nbsp; Can I tell you a terrible secret?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Don't bother, Gwen!&nbsp;&nbsp; I can guess - you've
started to get back a yen for the odd spanking!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I promise I won't over-indulge, Harriet my darling!&nbsp;
Just the odd bit of fooling about now and again - nothing&nbsp; heavy -
well, not that heavy - well, only really awfully heavy&nbsp; very occasionally
-&nbsp; I mean it's my arse after all -&nbsp; stop looking at me in that
reproachful way !!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Nice to see you looking more cheerful sweetheart!&nbsp;&nbsp;
All that morbid stuff about dying for me!&nbsp; I was getting really depressed."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwendoline returned to the subject of last night.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"That fifty turned into a whole lot more than fifty.&nbsp;
Guess how many I got, Harry.&nbsp; If you get within five we can share
a glass or five of of my very, very best Burgundy together"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"One hundred and twenty five?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Not even close.&nbsp; Try again."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"One hundred and fifty?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Wrong again!&nbsp; Give up?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Give up"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Three&nbsp; hundred and seventy six and a half.&nbsp;
The half was when you came in!&nbsp; Not bad, eh!&nbsp; I wonder if it's
a record of some kind?&nbsp; AND I took that little lot and still had the
strength to come and watch you two slugging it out on my terrace!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"When I was a little girl I'd ride my tricycle up and
down that terrace.&nbsp; Watching you take her apart was much more fun!&nbsp;
So was washing the blood away this morning while you were working away
out there!&nbsp; The stains will never come out totally - I'll always think
of you when I look at them!&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on - we''ll still have that
wine - Jenkins decanted it earlier and&nbsp; it should be ready to drink
by now - our special way!&nbsp; Stay where you are,dear!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll
be right with you.&nbsp; Lie down on your back and get yourself&nbsp; ready!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Gwen soon returned with one glass and a decanter.&nbsp;
She poured some wine into the glass, raised it to her lips and poured it
into her mouth,&nbsp; then leant over Harriet's expectantly parted lips
and let the wine&nbsp; trickle out of her mouth into her friend's.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>She paused while Harriet rolled the wine around her
tongue and swallowed.&nbsp; "What's the verdict, sweetie pie?</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Wonderful stuff, Gwendoline.&nbsp; Must have been
at least ten years in that cellar of yours, and all the better for having
been in your sweet mouth&nbsp; just now!&nbsp; Time for you to have some
- lie down and open wide!&nbsp; There's a good girl!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>&nbsp;By the time the decanter was empty and Gwen had
gone and procured two more bottles of the same rare vintage from the cellar,
both young ladies were ready to sleep.&nbsp; They walked very carefully
and uncertainly, lurching arm in arm to bed.&nbsp; Jenkins heard and saw
the naked, battered but happy pair singing some incomprehensible but clearly
obscene ditty,&nbsp; staggering clasped to each other,&nbsp; along the
corridor.&nbsp; He allowed himself a rare smile.&nbsp; Yes! The old house
was all the better for a breath of fresh air, he reflected,&nbsp; making
his own way to bed.&nbsp; He took a rather more generous swig than usual
from his hip-flask and fell asleep, remembering for the thousandth time,
that&nbsp; intoxicating wet kiss Gwendoline had given him last night.&nbsp;
If he could die for her, what a perfect way to go!</font></b>
