<p>part 1</p>
<p><b>Early Monday morning

</b></p>
<p>As Paul exited the elevator and walked the empty hall to
his office, he felt a creepy tingle on his neck.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing so far had happened to make him feel this way, no
thought had crossed his mind as yet, and he could not imagine why he felt the
sudden pinch of dread.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was far
too early in the morning for anyone else to be in the office.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps he heard the skyscraper creaking because of the lack
of the usual businessy noises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul shrugged his shoulders and concentrated on the tasks
ahead of him today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had almost
reached his office when he heard sounds in his office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Peeking around the corner, he saw Jeanine rummaging through his credenza,
a small pile of papers askew on his desk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
knew hed left it clear the previous Friday, and his anger rose watching the
intrusion of this most disagreeable woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul entered his office quickly and closed the door with
a bang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanine looked up startled
and stood with her mouth open, eyes darting from Paul to the papers on his desk
to the door and back again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
waited in silence for her explanation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed in the silence, and she finally spoke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I suppose you think youve got something pretty special here, she
spat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wouldnt get too
excited about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Youll just
make things worse for yourself by making a scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>I have no desire, nor need, to make a scene here,
Paul replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Youve done
quite well by yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
smiled a cold, mirthless smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
will have some explaining to do, my dear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
your cronies in our boardroom wont be willing to bail you out of this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As he spoke each word, he saw her face, a pretty one in the best of
circumstances, change from shock to fear to near panic, then to anger and
hatred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Ill take care of THAT, she hissed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You will never get an upper hand on me this way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>in fact, I consider this meeting fortunate, as you are going to bring
yourself down as a result.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
that, she passed the desk and strode purposefully toward him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She raised her hand as she neared him and sped up to strike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul ducked to the side of her onrush and she flew past, just missing
striking his neck as she tumbled by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now
between Paul and his office door, she went directly for the knob, only to find
it locked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul reached over and
covered her hand in his, intending to pull her away from the door to open it
himself and toss her out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanine
mistook the gesture and reached around to strike him with her other hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He leaned in against her, the blow missing his face and flopping over his
shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a tight clinch now, he
struggled to hold onto the hand he gripped as she tried to get free.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Her free hand grabbed a handful of his hair and she tried to
pull him away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul felt himself losing his grip on the doorknob and
stepped back to regain his balance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanine
released his hair and went at the door again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul composed himself in the middle of the office and watched her
struggle with the locked door.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>See that it would not open for her, she turned to him, flames
of hatred in her fiery eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
body shook and she growled deep in her throat, the feral growl of a cornered
animal, and she charged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul,
still smarting from her pulling his hair, decided to end this confrontation once
and for all and decked her with a single chop to her neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jeanine crumpled to the floor and lay there in a heap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul stood looking at her, the adrenaline draining from
his system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He felt like kicking
her in the head, but under the circumstances, could not bring himself to do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He considered simply throwing her out of his office into the still vacant
hallway and making her do the explaining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
also thought of chucking her out of the window and teaching her, in an
unfortunately fatal way, what it is like to be a bug hitting a car windshield.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As he contemplated his next move, his doorknob was jiggled.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Someone was at the door!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>new surge of adrenaline
surged through his body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A knock on
the door, and Paul, are you here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>It was Bea!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
a break, a friend visiting at this early hour, though she might be curious about
the prone figure on his office floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having
no choice, Paul unlocked and opened the door, pulling Bea inside and reclosing
it before she could speak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
motioned for silence and pulled her over to his couch, where he hugged her hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She returned his hug warmly and worriedly gestured to Jeanines fallen
form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He whispered in her ear the
basic outline, pointing to the desk and credenza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her eyes widened as he related Jeanines attack and finally his blow
that silenced her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul drew back and looked into Beas eyes as she
digested the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quickly she
came to an apparent decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
stay here and keep her quiet, said Bea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have just the thing for your friend there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul opened the door and she slipped out silently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He returned his attention to Jeanine, who was still out cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He felt like kicking her again, but instead lifted her up and placed he
inert form on the couch.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He checked her vital signs, breathing, pulse, and all seemed
normal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her loose flowing dress was
disheveled but he made no effort to straighten it out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He paced the office and stared out the window in turn, waiting
forwhat?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea obviously had
something on her mind, and figured it would resolve his problem, but he could
not imagine what it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>After about ten minutes, he heard noises in the hall
outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A soft knock on the door
was followed by Beas voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul
took a deep breath and opened the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea
walked in behind a large container, the kind youd see on a large television
set or refrigerator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wheeled it
before her expertly, stopping at the side of the couch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Now, quick!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Put
her in this box and well get her out of here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There doesnt seem to be anyone around.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul followed her direction and opened the box, positioned it
on its side, then lifted Jeanine from the couch and put her in the box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She still hadnt moved, though she was breathing more deeply than
before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Together they closed the
box and sealed it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea said, Im going downstairs to the loading dock to
move my car into position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
bring her down the freight elevator and Ill meet you there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul nodded, opened the door and let Bea out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He quickly put papers back in place before following, closing the door
behind him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The freight elevator
was at the back end of the office, among storage areas and a computer room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He wheeled the box through the empty office, straining to hear the sounds
of arriving staff members, his heart in his throat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The elevator took what seemed forever to arrive, but no sound or movement
was apparent behind him as he ducked in and pressed the button for the basement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul relaxed for the first time since that creepy feeling
hit him as he got off the elevator earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The feeling of relief, tempered as it was by his continuing peril,
continued to calm him and he thought the situation through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jeanine had it in for him and clearly did not expect him to arrive as he
did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She also was looking for
something  but what?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The papers
hed put away before leaving his office were not of particular importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had fixed her wagon, but in doing so he was taking a road that was one
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hed have to do something
with her, something drastic, and the thought was making him angry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Stupid BITCH!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He breathed deeply and cleared his mind again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Then there was Bea! He thought.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What the heck was she doing there so early?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How did she get in?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What was
with the box  was it actually intended for HIM?!?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Were Bea and Jeanine in cahoots for some reason  man-hatred or
whatever sickness Jeanine evinced  were they after Paul?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He shook his head and dismissed the thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And yet...</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>The elevator opened on the loading dock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A mini van was parked at the closest berth, engine running.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea stepped out of the drivers door and walked to the back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She looked excited and scared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
opened the door and pursed her lips and brow at him, indicating her desire for
Paul to hurry the bleep up!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
wheeled the crate to the edge of the dock, removed the cart, and jumped down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Between the two, they manhandled the box into the van.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Luckily the rear seat was missing, and the crate fit snugly into the back
of the cab.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ANOTHER coincidence,
thought Paul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Much too weird, so
Id better be on my guard</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>After climbing in the van they eased out of the dock
area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The guard was walking down
the ramp opposite the van, back turned to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea turned left onto the street and they were gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul let a deep breath out and stared ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea looked at him nervously intermittently, while guiding the van through
the early morning traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>They arrived at Beas place and pulled around back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea went to open the garage door and Paul opened the back of the van.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He pulled the box out and hitched it to the cart, dragging it into the
garage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea closed the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul opened the box and found Jeanine inside, still apparently out cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He lifted her out and she slipped back out of his hands, dead weight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He laid hold of her dress and pulled, ripping the material down the back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nervous now, he lifted her, again ripping the dress, this time from skirt
hem almost to waist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He let out a
low frustrated growl, Bea giggled, and finally Paul lifted and carried Jeanine
in the door, laying her on a couch in the main room.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Her dress was a mess, the back open exposing her bra strap
and skirt torn up exposing her thighs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
seemed to be still unconscious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Bea grinned at him and reached down to her torn back and
suddenly ripped the dress from her back, yanking it down her arms, exposing her
shoulders and giving Paul a glimpse of Jeanines breasts held captive in her
bra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea took the shreds of dress
and tossed them aside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pauls
adrenaline was up anyway, and he took hold of the skirt part and ripped it
completely off, flipping Jeanine over in the process of unwrapping her waist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jeanine moaned, awaking finally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul
saw that she had a pair of tiny cloth panties, now half off her ass from the
assault, and he beckoned Bea to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea
grabbed the little panties and pulled them off her hips in a quick move, then
pushed the groggy woman over onto her stomach again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Jeanine was now laying on her face, ass in the air, and
Paul and Bea found something they had not expected at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Protruding from Jeanines ass was something plastic; oval, about one
inch in diameter and two inches long, a deep deep blue color!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They looked at each other and suddenly Bea laughed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul laid hold of the thing, which he found he could grip easily, and
slowly pulled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Out of the womans
ass came a thin dildo, and it kept coming, and coming, and finally fell out,
Jeanines ass making a soft !pop!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
thing was eight inches long at least.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Jeanine was coming around.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She had coughed when they were stripping her, and now she
moaned and slid off the couch, catching herself with her hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly she was not back with the living yet, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea unclasped her bra strap, and her breasts tumbled out and hung in the
air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul was definitely excited now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanines ass faced him, and her sex was tantalizingly
hidden just below the soft flesh .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
saw hair peeking out and decided he would take her then and there, and work out
the details later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He glanced at
Bea, who was also hot, standing stiffly staring at Jeanine.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He nudged her and unbuckled his belt.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea suddenly came to life, smiling widely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She knelt down by Jeanine and motioned for Paul to get undressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He merely dropped his pants and shorts, and massaged his cock as he
decided how to penetrate the bitch before him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea reached between Jeanines legs and eased them apart, not wanting to
be too rough and wake her up before Paul had his chance.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul flipped off his shoes and stepped out of his pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He knelt behind Jeanine and grasped her hips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea lay down on the floor and crawled under Jeanine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Paul moved in, Bea clasped his rigid cock and guided it to Jeanines
cunt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She rubbed the cunt gently,
cooing and pulling gently on Pauls cock, now fully stiff and anxious for
contact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanine moaned again and
tried to raise her head, but Paul grabbed her by the back of the neck and forced
her head back down on the couch, face down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea was now working his cock across the cunt lips, moistening both man
and woman from their juices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Jeanine brew a sharp breath and tried to rise again, but
feeling Pauls hand on her neck, she relaxed and fell back to the couch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now her moans changed in tone and timbre, and Bea withdrew her hand,
allowing Paul to sink his member into the proffered cunt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He sank in slowly, and Jeanine began wiggling her ass, sucking his cock
in deeper inside her. At last Paul hit bottom, and he leaned heavily on her
back, both hands now on the back of her neck and head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He relished the depth of his penetration, the violation of his adversary.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He raised up and pulled out, or almost out, and sank in
again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Bea sat up and moved behind him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She loosened and removed his tie, and unbuttoned his shirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She took his tie and placed it around Jeanines head, covering her
eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul moved his hand and she
tied it, tight, around her head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
lifted Jeanines head to check that the tie completely restricted the
womans vision, then dropped it back on the couch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She smiled at Paul and sat on the couch next to Jeanine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul was pumping Jeanine with increasing vigor, and Jeanines hands
grasped the couch tightly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
pushed back with her hips, forcing Paul deeper inside her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He grasped her hips and ground his loins against her ass, his cock
reaching her cervix and seeking past to her womb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Bea reached over and held Jeanines shoulders, pushing
her torso back, trying to force Paul deeper inside Jeanines increasingly wet
cunt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanine leaned over to Bea
and nuzzled her thigh blindly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea
moved a leg, and Jeanines face lay in her crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul held still, his cock buried in Jeanine.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He lifted her back toward him, driving his cock impossibly
deep in Jeanines now dripping pussy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pulling
Jeanines arms back toward him, he motioned to Bea, who quickly stripped off
her skirt and panties and sat back down directly in front of Jeanine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul eased the helpless woman down to the couch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jeanine found herself between Beas legs, face against Beas soft
pubic hair. She sighed and craned her neck to get at the prize hidden in the
light hair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea arched her back
allowing Jeanine to reach the spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Jeanine nosed her way between Beas nether lips and
kissed her hole gently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
repeated this several times before opening her mouth and French kissing Beas
pussy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea squealed with delight
and grasped the back of Jeanines head, guiding her actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea closed her eyes and leaned back, holding Jeanines head tightly
against her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanine deep frenched
Beas cunt, engulfing the organ with her mouth, sucking and pulling and
kneading the soft flesh, inciting Beas juices to flow and swallowing them as
rapidly as Bea poured them out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul had watched long enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He withdrew, almost completely, and then pushed in again,
testing Jeanines reactions, careful not to upset the lovemaking before his
eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanine was transfixed on
Beas cunt, seeming oblivious to his movements, so Paul began to push more
quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon he was riding Jeanine
high, slamming into her to the hilt, his balls slapping against her cunt hair
and splashing her fine lubricant all over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Bea lifted her legs and rested her feet on Pauls
shoulders, completing the harmony and rhythm of their movements. This lifted her
hips also, exposing her anus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanines
tongue now flicked between Beas cunt lips and her ass, with each pass getting
closer to the bud of Beas back hole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul
was now slamming Jeanines cunt intensely, his gorge rising, and Jeanine
suddenly stiffened and let out a long grunt, climaxing from the scent before her
and the pounding of her pussy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>She came in spurts, and re-lubed Pauls dick with her
juices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was now sighing,
moaning and crying, burying her face again in Beas sopping pussy before her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She reached around Beas ass and massaged her anal bud with two
fingers, poking through the tight muscle gently and withdrawing in rhythm with
Pauls rapid and effective thrusts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanines
ass dropped a bit, no longer able to keep up with Pauls pounding, and he
finally slipped out, hard and slick with her cum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Paul stood and pulled on the tie around Jeanines eyes,
lifting her head away from Beas crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He guided her face to his own sex and pushed his member against her lips,
which opened and took it in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
terribly excited now, and using the tie as a handle, he shoved his cock deep in
her throat repeatedly, nearing his own climax.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Bea was helping by pushing the back of Jeanines head
as he thrust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea was
extraordinarily hot and coming on her own, flicking her clitoris with her
fingers, Jeanines hand still massaging Beas asshole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally Paul could resist no longer, and just as he began to pour his
seed down Jeanines throat, he ripped the tie off her head, allowing her for
the first time to see her attackers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Jeanines eyes opened just as Paul squirted his first
load of jism into her mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
looked her straight in the eyes as he thrust again and again to her throat,
spurting repeatedly and finally spilling the remnants of cum as his dick
softened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Jeanines eyes were hard to fathom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When she first looked up at him there was no flicker of recognition as
she concentrated on handling the large cock that came in her mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Pauls initial intense orgasm gave way to his emptying his balls in
her, Jeanines eyes grew round and clearly showed fear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, she worked hard to empty his balls and swallow every drop,
giving him head expertly and with passion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>He had no more seed to spill, yet he remained inside
Jeanines mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
comfortable, and she apparently was unwilling to release his cock as it
detumesced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sucked on him
intently, not so hard as to hurt, but enough to keep the blood flowing so that
as she took him in, he continued to hit her throat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She now cupped his balls in oone hand, massaging them to release the last
drops of immature sperm that lingered between his testes and the shaft of his
dick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul had not had a blowjob
like this since, well, since Bea had given him head on Friday!</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Bea was watching all this between slitted eyelids,
petting her own pussy after coming gloriously while watching the two before her
climax.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeanines hand was still
at Beas ass, one finger having broken the seal of Beas anus and now
trapped inside until Bea decided to release it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul was leaning over Bea, having come around to Jeanines side and had
one foot on the couch and one on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He smiled at Bea and reached down to tweak her nipple through the cloth
of her blouse and bra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She arched
her back, inviting the gentle pinch and laughingly sighed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>Jeanine still held Pauls dick in her mouth, but it was
now hopeless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He swiftly softened
and finally pulled himself out of her sucking mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He sat on the couch next to Bea and put his arm around her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bea leaned forward so his arm could drop down around her waist, then
stood briefly to remove Jeanines finger from her asshole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jeanine gratefully collapsed to the floor on her back and gazed silently
up at the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>[more:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paul
demands Jeanine explain what her problem is with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; Paul and Bea use their new toy girl some more, </span>then it is back to the office]</p>

Reader:<br>
In
at least two of my stories&nbsp; youve read of the protagonist (hero of the story)
hitting women and knocking them out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dont
think for a minute that I condone physical violence toward women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I do not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The man who
punches or otherwise strikes a woman in any situation other than self-defense is
a coward and a bully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many men beat
women because they can not get it up. Impotence is not your partners fault,
so get real and DONT BEAT WOMEN.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Get
help instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>porzu
