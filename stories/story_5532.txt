Three: Sky Iron and Yankee Rituals


The day passed slowly. While Kehanee was helping herself to an
early lunch, Chaz let himself into his uncle's room with the
intent of doing some serious snooping around. Normally he was a
firm believer in respecting other people's privacy, but he was
getting pretty tired of being kept in the dark--especially when
it concerned the strange visitor who he seemed to be falling in
love with.

Like the rest of the house, his uncle's room was cluttered with
an eclectic hodgepodge of antique baubles and miscellaneous
knickknacks. The walls were lined with various kinds of old
furniture that ranged from bookcases and file cabinets to desks
and nightstands, all of them covered with an incomprehensible
amount of stuff. How his uncle managed to find anything in here
was a mystery in itself.

Chaz's eyes were drawn to a strange contraption that hung on the
wall over his uncle's bed. It was a dreamcatcher: a netlike
circle of leather decorated with beads and feathers. Supposedly 
the Native Americans believed that it gave protection from 
nightmares and evil spirits.

After the strange events of the last few days, Chaz supposed that
anything was possible.

His gaze fell from the dreamcatcher to an old steamer trunk in
the corner. Thinking that a trunk would be the most likely place
for hidden secrets, Chaz cleared it off and opened it. All that
greeted him were stacks of old magazines from the forties and
fifties.

"Where does he get all this junk?" He asked no one in particular.

Chaz put everything back as it was and looked around again. His
search stopped at the bed, where he caught sight of a
leather-bound journal lying half hidden under one of the pillows.
He picked it up gingerly, noting with excitement that the binding
was tattered and worn with age.

"Now *this* has gotta be something."

Opening it with the utmost care, he began to turn the pages. Most
contained sketches of strange, elaborate constructions and
devices that he couldn't begin to identify. In the margins were
hastily scribbled notes which no doubt explained the drawings,
but the writing was so cramped and faded that he could only make
out a few words. The most coherent illustration was of a room
with walls made of a hundred different mirrors all facing each
other. It was noted as being 'perfectly suited for the
acquisition and storage of wandering souls.'

Weird.

As Chaz flipped toward the end in search of something that made
sense, a slip of paper fell out from the back pages and landed on
the bed. He unfolded the paper and read it slowly, his face
warming with embarrassment. It was a note from his uncle, who
seemed to be a step ahead of him once again.

	"Chaz, since curiosity is a perfectly natural reaction to 
        such unusual occurrences, I expect that you have come into 
        my room looking for answers. You now hold in your hands 
        all the secrets in my keeping. This is the journal of your 
        great-great grandfather, Jebediah Michaels. He is the man 
        who started it all, for better or worse."

Below that his uncle had written a summary of the journal's
contents and a brief history of his grandfather's life. Chaz read
onward, almost spellbound by the words that flowed up at him from
the note's pages.

	"Haunted by his experiences in the Civil War, Jebediah
        developed a strong fascination with obscure spiritual 
        beliefs and practices, especially those held by the native 
        people of the Americas. He spent the remainder of his life 
        in pursuit of ghosts and spirits, amassing a wealth of 
        myths and legend. He was fascinated with the idea of 
        influencing the unseen world, but he seemed to have little 
        success until he settled here, when a discovery led him to 
        build this house and outfit it with devices intended to 
        summon and capture otherworldly beings."

Chaz couldn't suppress a tiny shiver. Apparently he'd been
staying in a ghost hotel without even knowing it.

	"This discovery involved a strange type of metal ore found 
        only on a nearby hill. Called `sky-iron' by the local 
        tribes, this material has long been believed to hold some 
        kind of mystical power. Your grandfather was able to 
        harness that power, and built some of the metal into the 
        walls of your room. Of his success in this we can both (so
        to speak) see the results. It is clear that Jeb had 
        additional plans for this house, but whether realized or 
        not, the remainder of his knowledge vanished with him when
        he disappeared from this very room in 192--"

There was a sudden touch on his shoulder. Chaz jumped and
screamed. The hand quickly withdrew.

"Ekah?" Kehanee ventured, sounding just as surprised as he was.

"Shit." He exhaled, feeling foolish and relieved when he turned
to see a familiar set of empty clothes standing behind him.

"Shet?" She repeated curiously.

"Sorry," he said, finding her hand and giving it a squeeze. "But
you scared the bejesus out of me."

"Becheesus?"

"Nevermind." Chaz felt silly to have let himself get spooked by
such a crazy story, but as he stood there holding the hand of an
invisible girl wearing a Metallica shirt, he realized that
`crazy' was fast becoming a relative term.

A kiss on his cheek and the follow-up nibble on his earlobe
helped to remind him what was really important. After a long,
soulful, pants-tightening kiss, he lead Kehanee back to the
kitchen, leaving the journal on the bed where he'd found it. Just
like everything else in his life recently, its answers had only
given rise to more questions. He still didn't know if her
condition was permanent or if she would eventually disappear as
abruptly as she'd arrived.

He wondered if she had the same concerns, or if she was just
taking everything as it came. He hoped for the latter. That was
the only way he could think of to stay sane in a situation like
this.

Chaz grabbed a quick lunch of peanut-butter crackers and milk
while he considered how best to kill time until his uncle
returned. He supposed that he could take her outside again. She
seemed to be adjusting well to her surroundings--maybe they could
even go for a walk.

A sudden thought struck him and he wondered why he hadn't thought
of it earlier. Horses. He could take her to see his uncle's two
raggedy old horses and if she was up for it they could even try
riding for a bit. After a few moments of consideration it seemed
like a great idea.

Sadly, he had no idea of the horrors that lay in store for him.

* * *

Chaz had been worried that the horses would freak out at
Kehanee's invisibility, but to his surprise they received her
with more affection that they'd ever shown him or his uncle, even
at feeding time.

The day had turned out hotter than expected, with a sticky
humidity brought on by the scattered cloud cover. Heavier clouds
seemed to be gathering on the horizon, their fat dark bellies
threatening rain or possibly even a thunderstorm.

At Chaz's prompting Kehanee had changed into cooler attire. She
now wore a blue form-fitting tank top that gave a good impression
of her high, firm breasts, and her bottom half was similarly
treated by a pair of denim cutoffs he'd made for her out of an
old pair of jeans. He'd told her that every self-respecting
country girl needed a pair of daisy dukes, but he wasn't sure she
understood.

The horses, however, were right up her alley. They greeted her
like old friends, a sentiment she seemed to return. She
gravitated to the older of the pair, a venerable chestnut mare
who whinnied and snorted with the eagerness of a horse ten years
younger. Kehanee murmured something into the chestnut's ear, then
laughed as the horse nodded and stamped emphatically.

Chaz smiled, thinking that he'd have to add horse whispering to
her growing list of skills.

She'd already mounted by the time he saddled his own horse,
seeming to prefer riding bareback. While it was a practice he
fully agreed with in the bedroom, it was beyond him as far as
horse-riding went.

The chestnut and its rider quickly galloped away, leaving him in
their dust. The empty clothes riding it turned back as if to look
at him, and again he found himself wishing that he could see her.
In his mind's eye he saw her as a slender Pocahontas; long black
hair flying in the wind, brown skin gleaming in the afternoon
sun. Then the vision faded and he gave himself to the chase,
nudging his reluctant mount to greater speed. Kehanee seemed to
be relying on her horse to know where to go, or for all he knew
she might be guiding it with some kind of horse telepathy.

He lost sight of her as she passed around a grove of trees, and
after that he was forced to follow her hoof-prints down the
narrow ravine of an old creek bed and up the slope of a tall,
bushy hill. Near the top he found the abandoned chestnut munching
calmly on some wild grass, alone. There was no sign of its rider.

Chaz was beginning to worry that she'd fallen somewhere when his
attention was caught by a circle of flat stones further up at the
crest of the hill. The stones were low and squared, looking
something like a midget Stonehenge. Veins of what looked like
white quartz ran through the rock, giving them a striped
appearance.

Draped over one of the stones were a pair of discarded daisy
dukes and a tank top. Smiling at the thought of a naked Kehanee
lurking someplace nearby, Chaz dismounted and went into the
circle. He looked around for a minute, wondering where she could
be hiding. Then he stopped and smacked himself in the forehead.

"She's invisible, you idiot." He closed his eyes and listened,
trying to hear anything that might give her away. After a few
minutes with no luck he decided that two could play this game.
Remembering that he was nearly as invisible to her, he took off
his own clothes and started exploring as quietly as he could,
thinking that being naked might come in handy for when he finally
found her.

The sound of a faint voice drew him toward the far edge of the
hill. He made his way over as stealthily as he could. After a
minute it sounded like he was hearing *several* voices. He went 
on, his curiosity piqued.

The ground ended at a sharp dropoff. About fifty feet below him was
a rocky swimming hole fed by a slow stream that wound down
through the trees, and enjoying the cool spring were no less than
five teenage girls, all bare-ass naked. Chaz stared in amazement.
Most of the girls were hidden in the water but one of them was
lying on a flat section of rock, sunning her audaciously curved
body. The girl's tits were almost cartoonishly huge and she was
sporting a seventies-style bush that Chaz felt a sudden urge to
cliff-dive into.

Unfortunately, this moment of voyeuristic beauty was disrupted
when one of the girls noticed him and screamed. Despite
everything he'd learned from porn, the quintet of naked girls did
not seem happy to see an equally naked and semi-erect guy
watching them from above.

Chaz retreated before they started throwing rocks. Embarrassed
yet elated, he resumed wondering where the hell Kehanee had run
off to. The clouds were rolling in quickly and he didn't like the
idea of her being caught in a storm all alone.

He went back to the circle of stones and called her name.
Nothing. He sat down on a rock and sighed, hoping that she hadn't
hurt herself or decided to run away.

A handful of leaves fell on his head and he reflexively brushed
them away, startled, turning just in time to see a pale reddish
shadow on the rock behind him. Then the shadow darted away with a
quiet giggle. Grinning, he pursued her around the stones,
impressed by how well she navigated and a little dismayed by how
quick she was. The game of hide and seek lasted several minutes
before he finally grabbed her around the waist and hauled her to
one of the smoothest, flattest stones. He sat and pulled her onto
his lap, her invisible naked butt feeling really nice pressed up
against his bare skin.

"I caught you, naughty girl," he said playfully, a little out of
breath. "Now what am I gonna do with you?"

"Hakah. Hakah oh nah." She panted and started wiggling on his
lap, the overall effect of which was to give him an instant,
raging boner.

"You are *so* bad," he insisted, then he got an idea of how he
could punish her for it.

Chaz took her arm and pulled her over his lap so that she was
lying across his knees with her backside upward. Sliding his hand
over her hidden curves, he found the smooth round cheeks of her
ass and fondled them affectionately before giving her butt a firm
slap. Kehanee squealed and kicked as he continued to give her a
mild spanking, finding himself unexpectedly turned on by it. And
judging by her weakening struggles and the occasional quiet gasp
he heard, she didn't seem to exactly hate it either.

"Bad girl," he said again, blushing and hard enough to drill
diamond.

"Hakah oh nah," she repeated breathily. He was going to have to
learn what that meant.

Her butt felt very warm under his hand, almost hot. He imagined
that, if visible, her skin would be glowing pink or even bright
red. Chaz was able to lean down just enough to place a gentle
kiss on one of her buttocks. He licked and blew on it, trying to
soothe the spanked flesh. She shivered and arched her back as he
treated the other side in the same way. He could smell her
arousal, a heady, musky-sweet scent that fired his blood and made
his cock twitch dangerously.

With a final squeeze he let her up. Kehanee immediately pushed
him back and crawled over him. He closed his eyes and
concentrated on the sensations of her skin brushing his, her hair
sweeping softly up along his chest and over the side of his face.
He felt her lips touch his forehead, then his eyelids, then his
cheeks. Chaz tried to kiss her but she dodged him, her mouth
brushing his neck as he felt her hands start to slide over his
thighs. He relaxed and sighed as she moved ever downward.

Finally a slow gasp escaped him as he felt his cock being touched
and stroked by unseen hands, kissed by invisible lips. It wasn't
really a blowjob; it was more like she was making out with his
penis, kissing it slowly and wetly all over, even rubbing it
against her face and neck as her hair brushed lightly against the
shaft. It was the most sensual, loving thing that any girl had
ever done to him. Chaz decided that he was going to have to spank
her more often.

He felt a gentle squeeze on his balls and felt his body tense
involuntarily. The light, pleasurable squeezing continued as she
went about kissing the head of his cock from every angle, and he
suddenly felt the urgent prickle running from his shaft to his
scrotum that signaled impending climax. He groaned urgently and
she stopped, but not before his frustrated penis gave a few weak,
abortive spurts. The first dribbled out and down onto his
stomach, the others stopped at the tip as he felt her lips cover
the head of his cock, capturing the rest in her mouth.

After a moment she withdrew, and with a quiet spitting sound the
white fluid flew to the ground. She climbed up over him again
until he felt her hips rubbing against his, her hair once again
tickling his cheek.

"You like?" She asked. He could hear the smile in her voice.

"Very like. Want more."

Chaz pulled her close and kissed her, finding her lips sweet and
her tongue salty. Kehanee pressed herself against him, her firm
nipples rubbing his chest as she straddled him. He felt a gentle
touch on his still-throbbing erection, followed by a gradual
enclosing warmth as her fingers lifted and guided him into her.
They both groaned as he went in, her slick clinging tightness
trapping and embracing him.

He closed his eyes, feeling rather than seeing as he lay back and
let her take over completely. She moved slowly at first, rocking
herself on top of him and moving her hips lazily as her pussy
molded itself to his cock. Then she began to bounce harder, her
soft groans in his ear prompting him to reach up and find her
tits, grasping the soft handfuls with his hands and holding them
firmly as she bounced faster, groaning loudly.

In. Out. In. Out. God, she felt so good. The soft, slippery grip
of her cunt was driving him crazy. Chaz sensed the slow boiling
rumble of a climax in his balls but hoped he could hold out long
enough for her to come too. He was actually grateful for the
small bits of pointy rock that were digging into his back,
because otherwise he would have ejaculated almost immediately.

His thoughts were interrupted by the wet smack of a raindrop
hitting his forehead, followed by a rolling boom of distant
thunder. He looked up to see that the sky was now a dark blanket
of bruised-looking stormclouds. Kehanee appeared not to notice.
In fact she was humping herself against him with growing urgency,
their bodies connecting with a quiet slap. She began corkscrewing
her hips almost violently, her tight, oily pussy squeezing him;
milking him.

It was more than enough to finish him off. He held her tighter
and grunted, cumming inside her with an intense, spastic gush.
Just as he came she slammed her body down on his, taking him to
the hilt as she answered his groans with her own. Chaz felt like
his balls were literally deflating as he continued to pulse
violently inside her, his thoughts reduced to bright, brief
flickers. So much for pulling out. Grunt. Invisible babies.
Groan. Fuck, this feels good...

He held her as their orgasms faded, hearing her panting breaths
in his ear. The smell of damp earth rose sharply and they felt
the cool patter of rain on their skin as the clouds let go with a
sudden burst, nature answering the fury of their spent lust with
a climax of its own. Then the patter of rain was drowned out by a
cannonade of thunder as lightning played over the horizon,
sending brief strobing flashes over the darkened hilltop where
they huddled in each other's arms.

A bright, licking flare of lightning startled them both, almost
seeming to strike right on the hill. Kehanee laughed giddily but
Chaz was not quite so amused. He supposed that sitting in the
middle of a thunderstorm could be lots of fun--right up to the
point where you got struck by lightning and electrocuted.

There was another flash and a strange glow rose up around them.
Chaz blinked, assuming that he was still seeing afterimages. But
no, it was real. The stones in the circle were *glowing*, the pale
veins now blazing an incandescent blue-white in the cloudy gloom.
He felt Kehanee gripping his hand tightly as if she too could see
what was happening. He looked over at her and was shocked to see
a strange wavering outline, the air around her body rippling and
distorting like water.

Suddenly everything snapped into place. The journal, his uncle's
note--they had to be sitting right on top of the sky-iron deposit
he'd read about! Chaz got up quickly and swung his legs over the
rock, preparing to grab Kehanee and make a run for it.

"We gotta get out of here!" He shouted, taking her by the arm.
But his voice was lost in a sudden explosion of light and noise
as a bolt of lightning struck right among the stones not more
than a dozen feet away. The rocks pulsed and hummed and Kehanee
was yanked from his grasp, pulled violently toward the center of
the circle.

He called her name, his voice battered aside once more by the
massive fork of lightning that struck down like a thunderbolt
from Zeus himself. His vision exploded in dazzling white as a
single image was burned into his retinas; the silhouette of a
feminine shape being outlined by snaking arcs of electricity as
the lightning hit her dead-on. There was a deafening crack and
Chaz found himself on the ground, twitching. The parts of his
body that didn't ache were quickly going numb.

That's it, he thought calmly, tasting dirt. I'm dead. But then he
remembered Kehanee and staggered to his feet, dazed. He'd seen
the lightning hit her. What if she was hurt? Or even...

Ears ringing and half-blind, Chaz stumbled into the circle and
began to crawl around, feeling the ground and praying.

"Please be ok. Please." He chanted, barely able to even hear his
own voice. At last his fingers encountered bare flesh. Her skin
was hot and sweaty, almost feverish, but she was breathing.
Ecstatic, Chaz finally allowed himself to breathe too. He felt
carefully along her body, searching for burns or other injuries.
She seemed to be ok. Unconscious, but ok.

He rested her head gently on his thigh and began to stroke her
hair while he waited for his vision to clear, not sure what else
to do. He was amazed that she'd come away from that lightning
strike without so much as a scratch. He couldn't see a single
mark on her.

See. A mark on her.

Chaz started and nearly let her head hit the ground. Holy shit.
He could see her! The shape of her body was still dark and
indistinct, but as his eyes slowly recovered he was able to take
in more and more detail, and what he saw took his breath away.

She was lying on her back, eyes closed, lips lightly parted,
black hair streaming over his thigh and down around her light
brown shoulders. Her breasts were smallish with dark nipples; her
stomach was flat and smooth, flaring out into wide hips. A shock
of sparse black hair rose on the soft mound at the cleft of her
long smooth legs. She looked youngish, somewhere in the
mid-to-upper teens. Her features were vaguely Native American,
sensual and gorgeous.

It seemed his earlier vision of Pocahontas hadn't been too far
off.

Chaz took her hand and held it tightly, dizzily admiring how
clean and even her fingernails were.  For a moment he thought he
was going to faint. Suddenly being able to see her was proving to
be just as much of a shock as when he'd first realized she was
invisible.

The excessive warmth of her hand brought his thoughts back into
focus. He could see her chest rising and falling rapidly, her
breathing fast and shallow. Her forehead was hot to the touch.
Not good.

Almost frantic with worry, Chaz found their clothes and quickly
got her dressed. He had to get her back to the house, maybe to a
hospital. He whistled for the horses, certain that it was
useless. No doubt they'd been spooked by the lightning and were
long gone. But to his surprise the chestnut mare appeared,
trotting briskly up to sniff and nuzzle Kehanee's limp brown arm.

Sighing in relief, he lifted the girl up and sat her on the
mare's back before clumsily mounting behind her. Holding Kehanee
firmly by the waist, he urged the horse to a quick walk. The rain
had slackened off but the thunderstorm continued unabated,
roaring and flashing across the sky like a sneak preview of
Armageddon.

Chaz held her tighter and whispered in her ear, which he could
now see as well as feel.

"Hang in there. You're going to be ok."

He hoped with all his heart that it was true.
