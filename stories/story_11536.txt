From the pen of Dr. John H. Watson: In which a score is settled.

Chapter 14: Retribution

Mr. Wooster and his man took their leave and headed for the back door of the warehouse while Cinwell and I lingered in the alley between the warehouse and the neighbouring building--an abattoir from the look and smell of it. It was not a far walk to the main entrance, and I still had ten minutes to wait for my comrades to reach their position. I was wary of Cinwell, despite his docility, so I kept my revolver close against his back as I steered us towards a dark shadow in which we could wait unobserved by any chance passer-by, however unlikely it was that anyone would be walking down this lonely road in such miserable weather so late at night.

"You know," Cinwell said conversationally, "if I were to run away now, there's little you could do about it. You aren't strong enough to hold me, even tied up as I am, and between your age and your bad leg there's not a chance in hell that you'd be able to catch me, and if you shot me, Roberson would surely hear and your whole rescue mission would be ruined."

I tightened my grip although I knew that he was correct in all his points. "Why aren't you running, then?"

Cinwell shrugged. Tension gripped my jaw. Our whole scheme was predicated on my ability to distract Roberson, and for that I needed Cinwell's compliance if not his active cooperation. At this point, I trusted Cinwell only slightly more than I trusted Roberson himself. Roberson at least was familiar in his habits and had uncomplicated motives; Cinwell was an entirely unknown quantity in our formula. I had nine minutes before I entered the lion's den; I might as well use that time to gather what knowledge I could.

"Jeeves guessed that you were an honest policeman when you started your career. Was he correct?" Cinwell might lie, but if I could get him talking enough, I might be able to shine a light on the character within.

"Yes," he said, then qualified, "Well, as honest as anyone, I suppose."

"What happened?" I asked.

"Do you truly want to know, or are you merely passing the time?"

"I'm a writer; of course I want to know. A fall from grace is the theme of some of the world's most famous literature, from Greek tragedy and the Bible down to Matthew Lewis's salacious gothic novel."

"Always after the human element. I should have suspected something like that from a man who put a forty page Mormon romance in what was otherwise a good mystery."

"If you say one word about ruining a classic example of logic and deduction, I will shoot you," I said. Cinwell took the threat about as seriously as I had meant it. He snickered dryly. I pressed again. "So what is your tale? Why did you do it?"

He sniffed. "Debt."

"Gambling?" I had seen the frenzy that came upon people at the track and had been on amiable terms with one or two obsessive gamblers in my life. The passion invoked by the risk and the sums of money involved made it a breeding ground of crime. More than one of Holmes's cases had a gambler lurking in it somewhere.

"No, not gambling. I never saw the appeal." There was that tonelessness to his voice again, a forced distance as if he were putting the words, along with his anger, under lock and key so only faint traces of acrimony slipped past. "It started five years ago, when I was a sergeant. My brother-in-law was in business; I, however, knew nothing of business matters. He convinced me to invest heavily in one of his projects, a project that failed. He committed suicide in the wake of his failure and I was left financially ruined with my widowed sister and her child to support.

"Superintendant Adams, who was still an inspector then, offered me a proposition��"work for him on the sly and receive a cut of his profits��"and I accepted. Within a year, I'd earned enough to pay off my debtors, but once down that path…" He trailed off, and when he resumed his story, his words were more deliberately casual, and no longer carried the whiff of suppressed rage. "Well, to hell with it, I thought. Might as well be hanged for the goose as the gander. I was taking in five times as much as I could on just my policeman's salary. I was able to afford a lifestyle I'd never had before and could pay for my nephew to attend a respectable public school besides. Furthermore, Adams intimated that anyone who tried to get out would find himself with more enemies than he knew how to handle, so there were disincentives to stop and every reason to continue as I was. And there you have it: the self-justifications of a petty criminal. I fear it's entirely prosaic; no heartfelt romance to enliven your story."

"How old is your nephew?" I asked.

"Thirteen."

"Any children of your own? A wife?"

"No. It's bad enough having my sister and nephew as dependants." Cinwell's comment hung in the silence for the space of three breaths.

"You're tired of the obligation," I said with sudden insight. "You want it all to end. That's why you're not fighting me, because dead, wounded, or convicted of abetting criminals, it all means the same thing for you. It means an end to your current circumstances and that is precisely what you want."

Cinwell did not reply, but I did not need his affirmation to know that I was right. "But it's not just that, is it," I continued. "You resent the obligation to your family that made you become a criminal, and yet you cannot choose to put an end to your unlawful way of life or else your sister and nephew will be left to fend for themselves. Your actions, your sins, will be rendered meaningless and you will have debased yourself in vain. So, you do not act for yourself, but passively wait for fate to make the choice for you."

Cinwell was still, his limbs trembling. He snarled. "Are you using your experience of observation and deduction to reach your conclusions?"

"No, I'm using my knowledge of the human heart."

"Fuck you," he spat. "And your friends, and all your sanctimonious judgment."

"Inspector," I said. He was struck by my mode of address, as I'd intended. I had his attention if nothing else. "I can't claim to know you and I can't say that I like you, but I have encountered many criminals in my long years working with Holmes. A few of them were near demonic in their capacity for evil, and a few were genuinely noble, who broke the law only because the law was not able to grant justice, but most were neither extreme, merely ordinary people with all the ordinary human frailties��"pettiness, anger, greed, jealousy, lust, and fear. If there's one thing I have learned, it is that anyone and everyone has the capacity to become a criminal."

"Including respectable and stalwart doctors?" Cinwell replied sardonically.

"More than you could know."

He gave that dry, bitter chuckle that I was learning was characteristic of him. "Are you trying to save me?"

"No," I replied. "I'm trying to have one less enemy. It would make my coming confrontation simpler."

"I like you. You're honest. I don't know many honest people anymore. Of course, I dislike you for the same reason--honest people are smug and complacent bastards. But there you have it." He paused. "I'm not your enemy."

I considered his words, then lowered my revolver. He twisted his neck to glance over his shoulder and even though the shadows were too dark to see his expression, I could feel his surprise in the quality of his silence. "As you said, you could have run away at any time and I wouldn't have been able stop you. Besides, my fingers were growing cold in all this damp." I put both revolver and hand in my coat pocket.

Cinwell and I stood side by side, neither of us breaking the weighty hush that had overtaken the alley. Many minutes later, Cinwell spoke again. "Would I be pressing my luck to ask that you untie my hands?"

I was not expecting such a prosaic request after such a long and thoughtful silence, but the answer was simple. "Yes, you would."

"I think my arms are growing numb."

"I'll loosen the binding." I picked at the tie, trying to get a bit of slack in Mr. Wooster's tight knot. I wondered if I was bestowing too much trust on Cinwell, a man who openly confessed his essentially deceitful nature. I knew, however, in ways that had nothing to do with deduction and everything to do with instinct that, whatever his motivations, Cinwell was on our side��"for now. It took a devilishly long time to pry open Wooster's knot and retie a new one. As soon as I was done, I took out my pocket watch and peered at it in the gloom. "It's time."

I took out my revolver and resumed the role of captor. Prodding Inspector Cinwell before me, I walked the few steps down the pavement, which took us to our destination. I rapped on the door, unhesitatingly, acting before uncertainty could set in. A few seconds later a gruff voice with a thick Liverpudlian accent came from the other side.

"Who's there?"

I nudged Cinwell with the barrel of my revolver, urging him to answer. "It's Inspector Cinwell," he said. "Open the door."

There was no reply, but the bolt grinded as it slid back and the key rattled, turning in the lock. The backlighting in the warehouse meant that the guard at the door did not at first notice me lurking behind Cinwell's tall form. I kept my back to the doorframe and my hostage between me and my enemies, gaining the threshold before the guard saw me, cursed under his breath, and went for his pistol.

"Roberson, I want to talk," I called out. The guard's pistol rose slightly, but before he cocked the hammer, he glanced questioningly at Roberson, who was making his way around a nearby table��"a plain, wooden bit of furniture with a lamp, the only source of light, standing at the centre.

"Let him in," Roberson said, his head cocked with curiosity. "I want to hear what the doctor has to say."

The guard backed away and I entered the warehouse fully, sidling along the wall to prevent anyone from sneaking up from behind. "I propose an exchange," I said.

"An exchange? One common Scotland Yarder for the great Sherlock Holmes? Not a very equitable exchange. I hope you've got more to offer than that."

"I've got more," I replied. "Let Holmes go. Let him go and we'll go back to Sussex and never cross your path again. You can tell the world that you won, that you beat Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and forced them to surrender. Just let him go."

"Hmm, tempting offer. Would Mr. Holmes abide by it? He's in no state to be swearing oaths right now. Mens insana in corpore insano and all that."

"He'll abide by whatever I decide."

"He never struck me as the sort who would play the part of the obedient wife, but of course you know him far more intimately than I."

Roberson was goading me, trying for a reaction, so I took care to give him none. "What is your decision? Do you agree to an exchange of prisoners and our concession of defeat?"

Roberson's eyes narrowed and the edges of his full lips tilted up in a faint smile. "Your proposal has some merits, Doctor, but I'm afraid going to have to say 'No deal.'" I had not seen his pistol, but where Roberson was concerned, that meant nothing. His weapon came up in a flash of motion and I had scarcely time to register the movement before he fired.

Cinwell staggered back, forcing me off balance. Letting go of my grip on him, he fell to the floor, writhing and gasping as blood poured from his chest. I put his fate from my mind and my senses narrowed to the immediate concern of survival. My revolver was aimed at Roberson without my having any memory of doing it. For the second time in a week we faced off like duellists at the ready.

"Well, this is familiar." Roberson said mockingly. "Shall we give it a second go? No valet to spoil my shot this time."

Roberson was faster than I, of that I had no doubt. I prayed that my aim was truer, and thanked God that my rural lifestyle shooting stoats and pheasants honed my skill even through my semi-retirement. Sweat prickled on my brow as I watched Roberson's laughing eyes, waiting for the flicker that would warn me of his intent to fire. He, in turn, appeared self-assured and utterly undaunted by my own pistol aimed at him. I could only hope that it was overconfidence that loaned him his haughty air and not some secret knowledge, some special advantage about which only he knew.

"Come on, Doctor, I'm waiting," he taunted. "Or are you incapable?"

I heard pistols firing to my left and spared a brief thought for Wooster and Jeeves. The retort of gunfire echoed around me, and it was as if I were in the fields of Afghanistan once more and the decades between were but a pleasant dream in the midst of a waking nightmare. It was as if two separate minds inhabited my skull, one that watched, outside the whole scenario, and one that acted with calm and methodical purpose. I aimed for his right shoulder and pulled the trigger, dropping to the floor even as Roberson fired his own pistol.

I could not breathe, and for one terrifying moment I thought that I had been hit, a punctured chest the source of my breathlessness. To my intense relief, a moment later my lungs recovered from the shock of my heavy impact with the ground. I inhaled deeply once, and a second time. The warehouse was still but for a few groans of pain; all gunfire had ceased and I was unhurt. The same could not be said for Roberson. He was sprawled across the ground, dazed and squirming from the sudden injury.

I ran to where he had fallen and snatched up his pistol before he could recover his senses. It was only then, with the immediate threat neutralized, that my thoughts returned to me and I became aware of my pulse pounding in my ears. Scanning my surroundings for further danger, I saw none. One man was on the ground, his glassy eyes and slack jaw combined with the broad red stain across his chest proclaiming him dead. Two more appeared to be unconscious but otherwise unharmed, and Jeeves was at this moment subduing a forth man, twisting his arm behind his back until he dropped his knife.

The soldier's instincts fading, the doctor's instincts came to the fore. There were many people hurt, and as in any other battlefield, I needed to determine the best way to proceed to treat my patients efficiently and effectively. My eyes went first to Holmes, who was locked in a small cage against the wall. I desired more than anything to rush to him first, to ensure his wellbeing before all others, but other than a flush to his cheeks and an assortment of bruises, he did not appear to be in imminent danger. Holmes more than anyone would understand putting practicality above sentimentality. In fact, I suspect that had I attended him first, I would have received a tongue-lashing and a rant about romance and irrationality and orders to see to our companions first. His treatment could be delayed; others could not.

Three men were bleeding: Mr. Wooster, Inspector Cinwell, and Roberson. The shot that felled Roberson shattered his scapula, but missed all major veins and arteries. His care could wait. Cinwell was curled on the floor and gasping for air. The bullet had punctured the lower left side of his chest, and must have lodged somewhere in his ribs, judging by the lack of an exit wound. Mr. Wooster was sitting on the floor, leaning back against a shelf. His left arm was coated in blood, which was spurting from his upper arm in worrying pulses, despite his hand covering the wound.

Glancing between the two of them, I chose Mr. Wooster. I had no idea how long he had been haemorrhaging, but it would be the work of a few seconds to give him basic aid, and in any event I would need to retrieve my medical bag from Jeeves before I could do anything for Cinwell. I staggered over, breathing deeply to get my trembling under control and loosening my tie as I went.

By the time I had reached Mr. Wooster's side, Jeeves had knocked out the last guard, and, from the look of it, knocked out a few of the man's teeth while doing so. I called to him. "Jeeves, secure Roberson, then bring me my bag." Paying no attention to his reply, I knelt where Mr. Wooster sat propped against a shelf, looped my tie around Mr. Wooster's arm, and knotted my makeshift tourniquet. Mr. Wooster himself was conscious, but pale.

He winced as I cinched the tie, saying, "Did we win?"

"How do you feel?"

"A trifle dizzy, and my arm hurts like the dickens."

I reached for his right wrist to check his pulse. It was fast, but still strong, and he appeared stable. "Put pressure on the wound and call out if the dizziness gets worse."

Next I made my way to Cinwell. He was bleeding less profusely than Mr. Wooster, but air whistled through the bullet hole. I took a few seconds to untie his hands and turn him onto his back. I pushed his waistcoat and shirt aside and, plucking Cinwell's handkerchief square from his pocket and folding it up with my own staunched the wound.

Jeeves returned, then, placing my black medical bag at my side. As I wrenched at the buckles, I said to Jeeves, "Keep an eye on Mr. Wooster. The tourniquet should stem the bleeding, but let me know if his condition worsens. And bring him over here if you can. It will be easier for me if we can keep the patients in roughly the same place."

Cinwell, like Wooster, was conscious, although much less cognisant. All the same, I spoke to him, trusting that even if he did not understand the words, the professional tones of a doctor would be comforting.

"I can't stitch your wound yet, not until you're at a hospital and have a chest tube in you to drain the blood out of your thoracic cavity, but the bandage I'm putting on should help." I dabbed away the blood and taped an airtight dressing over the hole in his chest.

Cinwell choked and rasped out, trying to speak. I bent closer so I could hear his words. "Damn Roberson to hell. And Superintendent Adams. And you, too."

It was not the worst thing I had ever heard from a patient in pain. "You're welcome."

I stood just as Jeeves returned, carrying Mr. Wooster in his arms like a groom with his bride. He set Mr. Wooster on the ground with the tenderness of a parent putting a child to bed and removed his jacket to place under Mr. Wooster's head for a pillow.

"I'll check on Holmes, then come back to finish tending to Mr. Wooster."

"Very good, sir," Jeeves replied. He retrieved a key from his waistcoat pocket. "I liberated this from Roberson; it will open Mr. Holmes's cell. Roberson and his associates are currently residing in the neighbouring cages."

I thanked Jeeves and took the key. At last I was able to go to the person I wished most to attend. Holmes himself was crouched near the bars, leaning against them as if they were all that were keeping him upright. I unlocked the door as fast as I could and fell to my knees at Holmes's side.

"Sherlock," I said, reaching out for him and self-indulgently stroking the back of his hand with my thumb before turning his hand so I could check his pulse. I scanned his face and body for clues to what Roberson had done. My first impression was one of battered dishevelment: coat and waistcoat gone, shirt untucked and buttons missing, hair wild, lip split and swollen, cheekbone bruised, nose bloodied, and two black eyes. His face was flushed and dotted with sweat, but his eyes were bright and alert. On closer examination, however, his eyes seemed too bright and too wide and staring, the pupils dilated and shining. The flush on his face was at odds with the chill of his hand, and even though his cheeks were rosy, the tip of his nose was bone white. His pulse was thready and weak and his fingertips were the same ghostly white as his nose. That, along with Cinwell's early description, was enough to give me a diagnosis. "Damn him," I muttered, wishing for a moment that I'd aimed for Roberson's heart and not his shoulder.

"John." Holmes's voice was hoarse. "Roberson...he..." His gaze and his words drifted away as if he were too exhausted to hold either a look or a conversation.

"Holmes," I said, squeezing his hand to hold his attention. I could only guess at the dose or how long ago it had been given, and could not be sure what condition his mind was in. "Holmes, you have ergotism. Ergot poisoning." Holmes, staring unblinking into space and moving his lips as if speaking to himself, did not reply. I placed a hand under his jaw and gently turned his face towards me. "Holmes, are you listening?"

"I'm drugged, not..." His eyes skittered as if reading words across a page. "...deaf. It's better now, it's better. I was on fire. Oh, God, John, I was burning, burnt as a witch, just like they warned me. Burning in hell…monstrous dogs gnawing…" He shook his head. "It all seemed so real. More real than this."

I was chilled to the core to see dampness in his eyes and hear a stuttering quiver to his breath. I had never before in my career seen a case of ergotism, but one of my medical school lecturers had dealt with an outbreak in a small village on the coast of France and had loved to regale the students with its strange and horrifying symptoms: nausea and vomiting in the earlier stages; convulsions and hallucinations so vivid that one patient climbed to the hospital window and jumped to his death, all to escape some terror that no one else could comprehend; constriction of the capillaries causing dry gangrene in the distal limbs in the later stages; and, of course, the intense burning whence it derived its name in medieval times��"St. Anthony's Fire. What Holmes must have endured at the height of the poison's effects, I felt ill to imagine.

"I'm here; I'm real." I brushed my lips against his. He sighed against my mouth and when I drew away he dropped his weary head on my shoulder. "Come," I said, draping his arm over my shoulders and wrapping my own around his too thin ribcage. We both groaned as I hauled him to his feet, my leg protesting the motion. "Let's get you out of this wretched cage."

Together, we hobbled across the room to where Jeeves watched over Mr. Wooster and Inspector Cinwell. Holmes, trembling in my grip, moved with uncharacteristic clumsiness. Once I sat him down I surveyed my three patients. "Right. Holmes first, then stitches for Mr. Wooster, then I'll dress Roberson's shoulder if he'll let me." I set to work. As I took a small jar from my bag, Mr. Wooster, who was peering curiously at the proceedings in a manner entirely too cheerful for a man who'd been stabbed, asked, "What is that?"

"Glyceryl trinitrate," I answered.

"Glistening what?"

"Glyceryl trinitrate," Jeeves said, in a voice like a school master. "It is more commonly known as nitroglycerine, although it was initially named 'pyroglycerine.' It is also sometimes known as trinitroglycerine or 1-2-3-trinioxypropane."

"Good Heavens!" Mr. Wooster exclaimed, drawing back. "What if it blows up?"

"It's not pure nitroglycerine. It's perfectly safe," I replied soothingly. "It dilates the blood vessels. With luck it will counteract vasoconstriction before the gangrene takes hold." I used a swab to apply the substance to Holmes's bloodlessly white fingertips and nose, then removed his socks and shoes to do the same to his toes. "It will take effect in a few minutes," I said, even though Holmes showed no sign of listening to me or to anyone, instead staring across the room to the cage where Roberson now sat favouring his shoulder. I swept a gentle hand over his head, running my fingers through his hair before turning my attention to Mr. Wooster.

Cutting the fabric of his jacket and shirt from cuff to shoulder I revealed the gash, which was deep, but not terribly long. I gave him a small injection of morphine for the pain, cleaned the wound, and began stitching. I quickly learned that while Mr. Wooster had what might be called an effervescent personality under normal circumstances, when under the influence of morphine, his speech became incessant, raining out of his mouth like sparks from a fire.

"I say, that's smashing stuff. My arm already feels loads better; I can hardly feel the pain at all." He giggled. "For a while there, I thought I was done for. Jeeves saved my life, you know. I suppose it's not very Wooster-like to play the damsel in distress--did you know that a Wooster fought at Agincourt? And another in the Crusades? Jolly war-like folk, the Woosters, brave and unflinching in battle--where was I?"

"The Wooster family history, sir," Jeeves said.

"No, before that."

"Damsels in distress, sir."

"Ah, yes, damsels in distress. That is to say that, as a rule, I'm not one. Certainly not a damsel, although I will owe up to getting in a bit of distress now and then. The point is, if anyone is going to play shining knight to my damsel, or, well, gentleman in distress, then let it be Jeeves. Just as the beastly villain was coming in for a second blow, Jeeves came out of nowhere and walloped him a good one across the dial." Mr. Wooster's eyes were shining and he gazed at his man with possessive pleasure as he continued to recount his tale. I smiled and let his words wash over me, concentrating on placing the stitches evenly. It was quickly done, which left only one more patient��"one whom I was, to my shame, most reluctant to treat.

Repacking my bag, I said to Jeeves, "As soon as I'm done with Roberson, I'll watch over these three while you go for help. Lestrade's promised reinforcements should be here soon; you can guide them to the right warehouse."

"Very good, sir," he replied. It was surreal hearing that calm and plummy tone, more suited to a drawing room, in the midst of this bleak building and the carnage therein.

I looked at Holmes before I went to Roberson. It may have been my wishful imagination, but it seemed that the flush on his cheeks was receding and colour was returning to his extremities. He was drawn and exhausted, but composed, legs crossed Hindu style and eyes closed. I rose, sparing a second glance at Holmes to verify my assessment and comfort my own anxious mind, which still could hardly believe that Holmes was safe, and made my way to the cage where Roberson sat rocking back and forth in pain and cradling his arm.

Roberson looked up as I approached. "Have you come to take your revenge, Doctor, on behalf of your darling nance?"

"I've come to bandage your wound," I replied, filling a syringe with morphine. "if you will strip to expose your shoulder and come up to the bars where I can reach."

"How do I know you won't poison me?"

"If I'd wanted to kill you, I would have aimed a little further to your left."

Roberson remained stonily unmoved by my answer. The morphine was not medically necessary; I could wrap the injury without it, but medical ethics compelled me not only to treat injury but to ease pain where I could. "Primum non nocere," I said. First, do no harm, the motto on the watch fob that had been used to incriminate me. "But if you don't want the analgesic, I won't force it upon you."

I began to put the needle away, but Roberson stopped me with a cry. "No!" he said, and shuffled his way to the edge of the cage, wrestling off his jacket as he came. Waistcoat and shirt were soon pulled from his right side and I cleaned the wound, stitched it, and dressed it. Neither of us said a word throughout the proceedings. I, because I feared that if I spoke I would not be able to prevent the fury and abhorrence I felt from pouring out; he for reasons of his own that I did not care to fathom. Once I was finished with my task, I stood and, turning, nearly jumped out of my skin as I came nose to nose with Holmes, who had been looming over me for some unknown period of time.

"Good Lord, Holmes, you startled me!" His colour was definitely much improved, and he must have been feeling more like his old self if he was once again able to sneak up on me, moving without a sound.

"Holmes," Roberson said as if the words were venom. "You do know that you'll never get the charges to stick. I have money enough to buy half the police force, and you, you're just a relic of a bygone age. You don't have the friends or the influence you used to. And since your doctor insists on meddling, next time I won't be so generous in my willingness to spare him. I'll let you watch, helpless, as I slice open his veins and bleed him out like a pig in a slaughterhouse."

Holmes ignored Roberson with a casual nonchalance that was calculated to offend. "Watson," he said to me. "Your revolver, if you please. I want to interrogate Roberson and find where he's hidden your indiscreet writings and I'd feel safer if I were armed."

"Of course," I replied. "I have Roberson's revolver as well, so--"

"Give me both."

I hesitated for a moment. Holmes interrupting me or issuing demands was nothing new, but there was an edge to his intensity that worried me.

Roberson continued to spit and snarl, still aiming to cause as much fear and pain as was within his power. "Afraid of me, Holmes? You should be. I know what's underneath that mask. I saw you twitching and crying and frothing at the mouth like a rabid dog. I saw your mind shattered and your body helpless. You can put me in a cage but I still have that power��"to know what you look like broken."

I tried to sustain the same indifference to Roberson's taunts and threats that Holmes's did, but it was difficult to endure. I marvelled at Holmes doing so, given the brittle state he was in. "Are you sure you want to do this now?" I asked. "You're not--"

Holmes scoffed. "I'm perfectly fine. The poison is completely out of my system by now."

"You're not fine. You look as if you can barely stand up."

"I'm just tired; my mind is as clear as it ever was."

He did indeed seem lucid, but still I was reluctant. He snarled in impatience. "Hurry up, man! I won't be able to question him once he's in police custody." He held out his long, thin hand. I sighed and against my better judgment gave him the two pistols.

"Would you like me to stay?" I asked. Regardless of Holmes's assurances as to his health, he was still obviously weak; but Holmes, never one to acknowledge his limitations, rebuffed my offer.

"No. Go tend to your other patients. I can manage this alone."

I squeezed his shoulder as I passed, both an admonition for him not to push himself too far and a gesture of support. I returned to where Mr. Wooster and Inspector Cinwell lay. It seemed that Mr. Wooster had not stopped talking from the moment I left to the moment I returned, and as Jeeves departed to flag down the police, Wooster simply redirected his conversation from his manservant to me without a hitch.

"…she'd never believe a word of it, of course," Mr. Wooster was saying. "I can hear her voice now, bellowing out in that way of hers that can be heard across three counties, 'Bertie, you young blot! What are you on about now! Who would want to stab you? Are you sure it wasn't just some innocent chap who tripped on you while carrying a pair of scissors?' To which I will say, 'Assuredly not, Aunt Dahlia!' and add that I would show her the war wound if modesty did not prevent me from so exposing myself before a lady. And Aunt Agatha," Wooster shuddered melodramatically, "she'd probably use this as evidence to what depths I've sunk and the deplorable sort of people whose company I keep��"no offence to you or Holmes, of course��"and fix me with her gimlet eye, gnash her teeth, and rant on about how I need a strong-willed woman to cure me of my wild delinquency."

While Mr. Wooster talked, I checked Cinwell's status. His pulse was still strong, but too fast, and his breathing was increasingly shallow and laboured. He needed the care of a hospital, quickly. I bent to check that the dressing was still properly sealed, when the explosive sound of a pistol firing thundered behind me. My stomach dropped to my boots and my breath caught in my chest as I whirled about, dreading what I would see.

My heart resumed beating when I saw Holmes still standing, calm and uninjured, but the knot in my diaphragm and roiling in my stomach remained when I saw that Roberson was on the ground, blood spattered across the back wall in a spray and pooling around his head.

I ran to Holmes's side and stared down in shock at Roberson's body laying on the ground, unmoving, his skull shattered. Without glancing my way, Holmes handed my revolver back to me and proceeded to methodically wipe down Roberson's pistol with a handkerchief, removing fingerprints, I realized. "He was going to escape," he said. He did not turn to look at me, so I could not see what secrets he might have held in his eyes. "It had to be done."

He knelt to place the pistol in Roberson's hand and curled the dead fingers around the handle. Rising, he scanned Roberson's still form, imagining the scene as a policeman would see it--a criminal, cornered and desperate, about to shoot before being shot in self defence. Draping a gentle hand on Holmes's shoulder, I pulled him away from the body. A garnet speck of blood gleamed on his pale cheek; I stared at it in horror.

"Good God, Holmes! I--Good God!" I could not stay silent and yet I was at a loss for words. Each one tripped over the lump in my throat. "We had him captured! I thought we were going hand him over to the court. What happened?"

"Justice. He should have been hanged years ago."

"Taking the law into your own hands?" I was trembling, whether from fury or revulsion I could not say.

"It's an old habit."

"You murdered someone, Holmes. Shot him in cold blood, a man who was caged, unarmed…"

"People have died in our cases before."

"Accidents!" I shouted. "Or in the case of Moriarty, genuine self defence! Not this…this summary execution, this vigilantism!"

"I tried letting the courts deal with him once. They failed. Can't you see? This was the only way."

Holmes, always so damned sure of himself, would never be convinced that his actions were in the wrong. He had deemed it necessary, and therefore the only logical option--if this atrocity could be called logic.

"And how will the courts deal with you? And what about the police?" I asked. "Deserved or not, it's still murder as far as the law is concerned."

"Has it not occurred to you that I seriously and thoroughly contemplated the moral and practical considerations before I acted? That I did not do this lightly?" he snarled. He looked away for a brief moment. When his focus returned, he was again calm and aloof. "I have you to attest that it was self defence, and I'm sure Mr. Wooster will corroborate my account."

"He didn't see what happened."

"Mr. Wooster will believe whatever he's told to believe, regardless of whether it is the truth."

"And Jeeves?" I protested. "Jeeves will not be so easily misled."

"Roberson nearly killed Mr. Wooster. Jeeves would have pulled the trigger himself had he been the one holding the pistol. With such reliable witnesses--a solid doctor, a solemn valet, and a mostly respectable young aristocrat--the case will be over before it has begun."

I had no doubt that Holmes was correct in his assessment, for he knew well the habits of the police and the courts. I closed my eyes, wishing it would all vanish like a dream upon opening them. To my dismay, no such thing occurred. "I'll perjure myself for you, Holmes, because I love you, and it would kill me to see you hanged. But never again. Do you hear? Never again."

"No," Holmes whispered. "Never again."

Shortly afterwards, Jeeves returned. With him came a bevy of policemen, including a man who introduced himself as Lestrade's protégé, Inspector Shelton. The echoing quiet of the warehouse dissolved into the organized chaos of a crime scene. Cinwell was laid out in the backseat of an automobile and taken to Royal London Hospital. The surviving, unconscious criminal lackeys were shackled and carried away.

When they questioned each one of us in turn, Holmes averred that as he was speaking to Roberson, the man drew a revolver that he had hidden on him, and Holmes was compelled to shoot. It was accepted without question. I said that I was tending my patients when it happened, and so was not paying particular watch, but that to the best of my knowledge events occurred exactly as Holmes said they did.

Once the questioning was completed, I was able to use Mr. Wooster's injury and Holmes's recent poisoning as leverage to convince Inspector Shelton to drive us to Mr. Wooster's flat in a police car while Jeeves followed in Mr. Wooster's smaller vehicle. Mr. Wooster left his telephone number with the inspector in case further questioning was needed, and at last we were left in peace.

Jeeves prepared a pot of tea and a light repast, but it was a solemn meal. Despite Mr. Wooster's irrepressible chatter, I did not engage in conversation, even though I knew it to be unforgivably rude of me to ignore my host. Holmes, too, was silent, picking unenthusiastically at his fillet. Our eyes did not once meet throughout the entire supper.

It was well after midnight by the time we'd finished eating, and the last few days had been far from restful, so we all retired to our respective rooms as soon as the dishes were cleared. Holmes and I held our mutual silence through our undressing and nightly ablutions. When we lay down on the bed, it was with our backs to each other. The rift between us had never felt so vast, a chasm the other side of which I could not even see, much less reach. I wondered how Holmes could have changed so much without my noticing, or, even more distressing, if perhaps he had not changed and I had simply never known him at all.

It was while I was in this state of mind that Holmes rolled over and placed a kiss on the nape of my neck. At first I ignored his attentions, but when his hand drifted around my back and over my chest, I shifted away and sat up, turning to face him.

"It won't solve anything," I said.

He blinked in confusion. "What do you think I'm trying to solve?"

I merely sighed in disgust and settled back down on the bed. Rare as it was for Holmes to initiate any sort of physicality, it was even rarer that I rejected it. He propped himself on one elbow and said, "You're angry at me."

"Of course I'm angry at you!" I exclaimed. "I would have thought you'd draw the line at murder, no matter how just you thought it to be."

"Roberson's actions threatened not only me, but you as well. If he had been acquitted, as he swore he would be, he would never have stopped until one or the other of us was dead. I could not allow that."

"So you weren't lashing out over the torture he'd put you through. It wasn't the ergot still poisoning your brain." Those were the two excuses I was clinging to--passion or madness. Not that either would have made the murder any less real, or less wrong, but it could render it comprehensible to me.

"No," Holmes replied. He hesitated for a long moment before continuing. "Perhaps it would be better if it were, less cold-blooded. I first suspected that I would have to kill him directly after our encounter with him in Mr. Wooster's sitting room." He traced a finger above my ear, following exactly the path of the scrape where Roberson's bullet had grazed my skull.

I shook my head away from his touch. "Good God," I breathed, appalled. "You'd planned to murder him all along?"

"Not entirely. I still believed that I'd be able to simply expose his criminality and see him in prison for the rest of his life, and I acted in accordance with that belief. Underneath the surface, however, where less noble thoughts linger, I imagined killing him ever since I saw you lying on the ground, motionless and bleeding. When he boasted about his money, his police connections, I feared that no matter what I did, what evidence I presented, it would not be enough. All my plans of capture to the contrary, I knew all along that gaol would not hold him, and I could not risk him running free, threatening..." He trailed off, swallowing deeply before he resumed his confession. "The solution was inevitable."

"You never used to say such things. You've grown harsh, Holmes."

"So has the world, and all the gaiety, the music and song, is the world trying to forget the darkness it saw inside itself. After the War…nothing is as it used to be. Not even me."

Holmes never spoke about what he did during the war. Aside from a few brief and impersonal letters to me, he had completely vanished from the world during that time. Those years were a black void. The hollow despair in his grey eyes undid my ire, and the horror I felt turned away from Holmes and towards the fate that had brought us to such circumstances.

"Sherlock." I stroked his hairline, his sharp widow's peak to his temple and further down his narrow face to his jaw and chin. "You're dearer to me than I can express, but you frighten me sometimes."

"I know."

"There were moments when I wanted to kill Roberson," I confessed.

"But you didn't," Holmes replied.

"I didn't."

"You tended his injuries, bandaged his wound, offered him Christian mercy," he said. "You're a better, nobler man than I." His voice dropped to a whisper. "I'm sorry."

I kissed his brow.

"My dear John, I don't know why you put up with me."

I smiled, a little softly, a little sadly. "Neither do I."

He curled into the circle of my arms and breathed deeply as I stroked the plane of his back. He was shivering ever so slightly, although his skin was warm, but I made no comment upon it, and if I had I am sure he would have denied it.

"I don't consider you a bad habit," Holmes muttered into the fabric of my nightshirt.

"What?"

He lifted his face. "I don't consider you a bad habit, or a mere convenience. On the contrary, at times you are damnably inconvenient."

I could not at first place the context for these unexpected statements. Then I recalled our argument all those nights ago in this very room and Holmes's ingenious evasion of the conversation. For him to bring it up again, now, on his own accord, brought a smile to my lips.

"Inconvenient, you say?" I prodded him to elucidate.

He turned his face away and looked anywhere and at anything but me. "At times. I confess, you occupy a disproportionate percentage of my thoughts. So you see, it would not be reasonable to assume that it is convenience that keeps me with you or you with me."

"So what is it?"

He licked his lips and darted his eyes like a nervous schoolboy. "Surely you can deduce the answer now that we have eliminated the alternatives?"

It was as close as I would get to a declaration from him, and, I realized with some surprise, it would be sufficient for now. Holmes could not act otherwise, and I could not begrudge his nature, no matter how it infuriated me. That did not, however, mean that I was compelled to follow his example.

I cupped his cheek in my hand and pressed my mouth gently against his. It was a simple kiss. There was no youthful fervour or lustful passion in it, just a long and abiding warmth. When our kiss ended, I brushed my lips against his ear.

"I love you, too, my dear Holmes" I whispered.
