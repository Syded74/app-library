ASSM_ANNIV_FLASH_Twin_Image_Effect
AUTHOR: C.D.E.

ABSTRACT: A husband is puzzled why his kids favor his co-
workers

	Russel and his wife, Renee, just celebrated ten years 
of marriage.  They have two daughters and two sons.  They 
are a happy suburban family.

The only thing that Russel finds odd is that each of 
their children strongly resemble four of his male co-
workers.  The four, as well as his wife, say it's not 
uncommon for people to favor some other person in the 
general population.  They called it the twin image effect.

	It was at a company social function, when each of his 
co-workers was with each of his kids that respectively 
favored them, when he really noticed the strong facial 
resemblances.  He also seemed to feel the eyes of other co-
workers on him and his family the entire time.  He also was 
suspicious of the hushed whispers and smirking smiles of 
other co-workers.  His wife said his nerves were playing 
games with him and that he was being paranoid.

His wife tried to downplay his discovery and didn't 
seem concerned.  She claims she couldn't see the 
resemblance he mentioned.  When he surfaced it to her again 
later that same night, she told him that if he weren't 
careful, he'd start rumors that his co-workers were their 
children's real fathers, and imply that she'd been 
unfaithful."

	"Oh no, I didn't mean anything like that Renee.  But I 
guess you're right.  People might get that idea."  He 
replied to her.

	"That's right dear, they might.  Also I suspect you 
need to go see our family doctor again, because I think 
you're experiencing delusional associative image 
resemblance behavior syndrome again."

	"What? I am?"

	"Yes darling, a good indication is when you start on 
this thing about our kids resembling other men.  See, 
you've forgotten already about the last time you saw Dr. 
Harris about your condition."

	"My condition?"

	"I can see now that we need to get you an appointment 
right away.  I'll call and see if we can get you in to see 
him tomorrow."

	"Russel, you're back again?  I hear your condition 
flared up again?"

	"Dr. Harris, my wife said the same thing. However, I 
can't remember having seen you before for such a 
condition."

	"That's okay, that's not an uncommon symptom of the 
condition.  The treatment this time will last much longer.  
In fact, this new drug should make it go away permanently.  
You won't have to be obsessed about your current or future 
kids looking like other men."

	"Well, doctor, I-I wouldn't say obsessed, more like 
curious."

	"Either way, this injection will makeup for your 
body's shortage of a key chemical causing the malady."

	The treatment was successful. Russel no longer is 
bothered with worrying who his kids favor, even the new son 
he had a year later, who coincidentally, is the spitting 
image of Dr. Harris.
