>A stupid
>Pointless
>Question
>That was the last thing she said
>From that point on she was silent

>We tried to invite her into our conversations, bring her up in
topics so she would feel inclined to respond.
>I even tried mentioning a few topics i knew she loved, silly
things, trivial things that she should have even given a shift of
her eyes in response to.
>But she was silent
>Stared forward
>Hands neatly folded in her lap
>Not a word, Not a movement
>She wouldn't take a controller, wouldn't move from her seat.
>So we went back to symphonia, beat the game.


>We hadn't been too far, but the ending bits were tearjerking to
say the least.
>We lost all of our party one by one to various traps, had to
fight Kratos, then Mister-this-isn't-even-my-final-form.
>Angels, space travel, all that yank
>And the ending was something we all wanted to talk about, so
talk we did
>We discussed the balance between the worlds, the relationship
between the two main characters.
>No its hot, no its cold, no i lied its hot.
>Various things about magic being people, all that snazz.
>Was a game that influenced my youthhood deeply, but the
conversation was heavy
>There were bouts of awkward silence in between some of the
topics, stares that lingered a bit too long.
>It's tough to hold a conversation like that, to pretend to be
cheery
>To banter about a game and the ending
>Whats on your mind, what you're thinking right now
>Well it's obvious to everyone at that moment
>But what the fuck do you do about it.

>What's the real problem
>Did she love me?
>That's the problem, i didn't think so.
>Her actions seemed shallow, if glasses could be considered
"Casual" sex, then raven was like she was throwing it away.
>She didn't seem to enjoy any intimacy with me
>Like a friend forcing herself to be more
>For my sake
>That wasn't what i wanted
>Casual sex might be fun, but i was living in the dreams of media
and anime
>I wanted romance, love, all those important things that don't
really work the same way IRL as they do on TV.

>You might have only known this girl for the short three days of
this party, but i had years

>She was never unstable, never had hit me before, never had
thrown a tantrum and stopped talking to anyone.

>She was usually the most sane out of the group, but this had
somehow changed these last days.

>She had progressively degenerated into something completely
different

>It was like she was destroying herself and trying to remake her
personality as something new, just for me.

>Failing every step of the way

>Trying approach after approach as differently as possible and
failing.

>And something caused it

>I had no clue what

>But it was my fault

>So what did she want?
>Did she want a fake relationship to pull me away from someone i
might have a chance of actually connecting romantically to?
>Blondie had been completely receptive every time, shared the
passion
>Even when she wasn't buzzed
>Raven had only been passionate the first night, when we were
both rather drunk.
>Even then i couldn't be sure i wasn't just forcing her and she
went along because she trusted me.
>Everything past that? It felt like i had done it all, lied to
myself to imagine she liked it.
>She had it in her mind that sex was the way to win me over, just
like homely.
>Did she want our old friendship back?
>I had tried to give it to her
>I thought i had
>But i just made it worse, a thousand times worse somehow
>So that really was the question.
>What was i supposed to do, besides charge on like an idiot and
hope it all turns out fine.
>But the feeling in the pit of my stomach was back.

>That was the thinking, the thoughts that flowed through my head
for almost an hour.
>I don't remember what we were doing, it was 4:00, maybe 5:00pm
>If i'm honest, it was probably TV
>But it would have just been boring without those thoughts
>Nothing happened, no more sexy things
>No more cuddles with my new-found girl
>It was a quiet, empty, hour of relaxing and just chilling
>And the fact that nobody wanted to break the silence
>Because talking felt wrong when one in our company wouldn't.
>Better all be quiet than only one i guess.
>It was thirsty eventually from all that thinking
>I left to the kitchen, offered to get everyone drinks
>Blondie offered to help
>She really shouldn't have, she knew what birthday said
>But it happened
>We ended up in the kitchen together
>She just wanted to talk

>About lots of things
>About us, mostly
>We didn't really say it, but there was a relationship between us
now
>Boyfriend, girlfriend, couple. We didn't use any of those words
>But it was implied
>I think blondie preferred the term "Item"
>But some things weren't so much implied
>Like her flat out telling me that i wasn't going to touch anyone
else.
>I wasn't actually going to argue, Blondie was the only one there
that i kept telling myself i had a connection to.
>There was electricity every time we kissed, just being around
her made me feel better, and i had that generous urge to ravish
her until she couldn't be ravished anymore.
>In my mind, that was more than a crush
>But Andromeda was shining brightly that evening.
>Glasses was behind her, and interrupted with a small cough
>She had that tendency, to show up right when she was summoned
>and absolutely ruin everything
>She mused, almost half thought ,half real words
>"Don't go ruining my fun just yet~"

>I expected blondie to actually turn around and stab her
>But luckily there were no knives within reach
>Instead she just swiveled
>Some kind of angry frown on her face
>Blondie wasn't in a good mood anymore, her eyes were dark and
stormy.
>Cat's out of the bag
>Thanks Glasses you giant je-
>"I still need to get him naked, it's on my list~"
>She pulls this out of nowhere
>Fucking amazing acting, i believed her even
>Glasses the true master of the ruse
>But she held up a glare towards blondie.
>Which meant one thing.
>Blondie softened
>Like a delicious serving of 15% milkfat old-style ice cream.
>Which for those of you un-used to such treasures, was nearly her
hair color.
>She folded right over on herself
>Typical really, she wasn't very confrontational
>Her words, the ultimate compromise
>"y... i mean when the sleepover is finished"
>Hahaha
>If you haven't noticed
>Blondie is beta as fuck


>But she leaned over and whispered in my ear
>"B...but to me first please"
>Timid, quiet
>Not really a demand, a request really
>IT made me feel awfully guilty
>But it helped me realize something.
>That pit in my stomach
>Wasn't guilt.
>I forced a giggle when she whispered this
>Even though i didn't feel like giggling, it was cute
>she needed to know it was cute
>Glasses even gave us the appropriate grin.
>She had managed to convince blondie she was winning the race by
a fair amount
>I mean she was, but in different ways of course.

>We kept talking, Glasses busied herself gathering liquids for
human consumption and listened in.
>These kinds of talks, they just happen when a relationship is
starting out
>They're always different
>They're always about completely different things
>But they're always about the same thing
>It's a bit confusing
>You've had one in your past, or you'll have one in your future.
>Maybe a couple that never went too well and nothing great came
of it.
>Maybe one that went perfectly
>But as we talked, atleast the guilt went away
>I felt better
>I liked feeling better
>We consummated this feeling better with a kiss
>It was a lovely kiss, i could tell glasses wanted in on it too
>She even asked
>Rather awkwardly i might add
>I was full-on-ready to give her one
>Until she winked

>Oh fuck she was being clever
>I backed out of the kiss
>Pretended i changed my mind
>Turned around right to blondie and said the words glasses was
secretly feeding me through a microphone in my ear.
>"Sorry, kisses are off limits to everyone but Blondie"
>The mentioned girl was back to saluting me, a proud look on her
face
>Humming the national anthem, i could see the reflection of the
american flag in her eyes.
>Communism, had lost , Democracy had won.
>Red chinese victory, impossible.
>Communism, is the very definition of failure.
>Thanks to glasses, i now had enough points to get past the trash
tier trinkets at the glass case, and go for one of those fancy
electronic things behind the counter.

>So i gave glasses a hug and a pat on the back
>Winked back
>"Best i can do"
>Fuck i'm dying of laughter on the inside
>So bro
>But that was that, discussion over, kisses were off limits
>Wasn't even a bad compromise, but frankly i knew pushing
anything that wasn't focused on blondie would just end badly.
>Was more of a trap than any kind of real benefit to myself.
>[spoiler]If anyone you're with ever agrees to let you touch
other people, it's either a trap, or its hurting them and they
won't admit it[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]Unless they're personally involved too[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]I could make sure that happened[/spoiler]

>We streamed back into the living room, i ended up on the couch
again, glasses plopped down beside me.
>Blondie sat down next to birthday and whispered something.
>She was trying to be quiet
>But not quiet enough
>Raven stiffened, visibly
>First real movement she'd made, which in itself was impressive
>But she was up and out of the room in half a second
>Gone
>It's not hard to guess what blondie was whispering
>Birthday looked happy at first until raven vanished, then it was
just a sad look
>Blondie too
>Glasses too
>Me too.

>I didn't keep track of what happened, but blondie ended up
between glasses and myself.
>Snuggling me again
>I guess she wanted to comfort me, or wanted me to comfort her
for fucking up everything.
>I didn't shove her off, she made me feel better anyway
>Birthday glares at us
>But i shoot her an unhappyface and she allows it.
>It's back to cuddling i guess
>I just wish this other feeling would go away.
>Glasses gets up and follows raven
>Returns a couple minutes later, leading her by the hand
>Comb in the other
>Glasses is on the couch first
>Raven is forced onto her lap, and has her hair peacefully
assaulted by the bristles.
>Which does the trick, even if she's trying to hide it.
>She's relaxed, soothed by the brushing.
>It makes me worry that glasses really can read minds
>Brings back memories even i've forgotten.

>Used to be something i did, years ago when i was just spending
time with raven.
>Another one of those things we hadn't done in years, we grew up
and it didn't happen anymore.
>My stomach hurt, right at the bottom.
>Just remembering those things brought back the realization that
"friend" was no longer talking to me, or anyone really.
>Left me with a sad empty longing feeling
>Like i missed those days more than i knew
>Blondie was watching, and she pulled herself upright and
whispered in my ear
>"Maybe you should be the one doing that"
>She was honest, trying to get me to re-extend bridges with raven
>She didn't know how right she was
>So i offered to take the comb and let raven sit on my lap
>I felt like it was foolproof, an easy way to win her back into
the world of the talking
>She wanted more friendly physical intimacy, that was the only
thing left
>That was what she wanted, right?
>Except she doesn't respond, Glasses had frozen waiting for it
too.
>So i put my hand gently on raven's
>She snaps it away.

>Well that was it
>That was the last thing on my list of things she could possibly
want
>I didn't realize that she was doing the same thing i was doing
earlier.
>But i was lost myself
>So i asked
>"What do you want from me?"
>I tried to be as serious, as sincere, as emotionally invested as
i could ever sound
>I wasn't sure why i tried to be this way, but i did
>No response, no reaction
>IT didn't matter what i sounded like
>But one thing changed
>The pit in my stomach felt worse
>Now i knew what it was

>Well... why it was
>You know, the girl i talked to all day every day for years not
talking to me.
>Guess up till this point us fighting didn't seem real, wasn't
setting in correctly.
>But now it was.
>But i didn't know what the feeling was, only that it hurt.
>A heavy weight, growing every time.
>I was still rather angry at her for attacking me, and my chin
was probably bruised, but
>My stomach told me i had to try to smooth this out
>But realistically, my talking had done nothing to make this
better
>I just had to wait for her to talk again
>She would talk
>She had to talk...
>Right?

>It didn't work out the way i wanted
>Never does
>Blondie decided she needed a nap, had woken up way too early to
make breakfast and was dead tired.
>Said she was leaving to birthday's room, asked me to wake her up
in an hour
>Can do boss
>Raven was slumped over against the pillow, relaxed and maybe
sleeping
>Birthday still on the floor, glasses still brushing.
>We were rather relaxed, i figured now was as good a time as any
to try to re-initiate contact
>Various probes sent
>Multiple languages, hoping one will meet a tangent of alien
life.
>No responses
>):

>I wish i could say things were more interesting here
>But they really weren't
>I tried multiple times to get raven to talk to me, the other two
girls tried too.
>It really just, wasn't going to happen
>And the pit wasn't going away.
>So i said fuck it, after maybe forty minutes
>I left the room
>Ended up wandering around the house
>Aimlessly
>No real thought
>Until i reached Birthday's room
>Stepped inside
>closed and locked the door behind me
>And turned to stare at the sleeping girl.
>My sleeping girl.
>Figured it was time i wake her up
>Like i wanted to this morning.

>Now normally i had a thing against molesting sleeping girls
>But i could put up a waiver because this one had already broken
that rule on me.
>Fair turnaround
>I flipped up the covers
>She was adorable, sleeping with a little pout on her face
>Blonde hair a mess all over the pillows
>Shirt hiked up above her bellybutton
>That's fine, i didn't plan to disturb that
>With both hands i grab the edges of her panties and wiggle them
down her legs
>She's got em bent, so it's a tad bit more wiggling than pulling.
>Really only takes a couple seconds of movement before they're
off
>Discarded to the floor
>No need to do anything with them, not where i'm going


>I press my head between her legs, separating them enough for
room to breathe
>And i get to eating her out
>Really i'm not going to go over what it's like, because i've
told you already.
>But i can tell you her flavor was the same one i'd sampled
earlier.
>Imperceptible, light. Like drinking flavored sparkling water.
>No sugar, only bubbly, with a hint of fruit you wouldn't know if
the label didn't say so.
>It's not like i had any technique or anything, or magical plan
for doing this
>It was just the way i wanted to wake her up.
>I wanted to imagine in my own little world that waking up to a
blowjob must feel great
>So therefore waking up to the girl equivalent must be just as
good.

>Well it's just never that simple is it

>It was rather fun at first
>Tons of things to do with my tongue, plenty of places to explore
>Delicious flavor
>But that all kind of came back to reality real quick
>Firstly the flavor went away, really just vanished after a
minute or two.
>Then at minute 3-4, i realized i wasn't really able to get my
tongue as deep was i wanted and was running out of ways to play
the swirling game.
>About minute 6, i realized the only reason i liked playing with
women was because of the reaction they give me.
>Minute 7, i forced myself to go on, expecting the grand
awakening of the sleeping girl
>The face she'd make would make it worth it, assured.
>Minute 8, and 14 i think she actually had some mini-Os in her
sleep.
>I couldn't tell for sure, but she shifted and tensed a bit
>I licked her for what must have been fifteen minutes.
>Then i gave up

>My tongue was sore and tired
>My mouth ached
>My back hurt from the angle i was in
>I gave up
>Had a semi- but i wasn't going to care
>I was done with this entire lewd-wakeup thing
>I got up, i was contemplating waking her up just like that,
leaving her panty-less
>Maybe taking them with me
>But then i got an evil plan
>I grabbed her panties off the floor
>The lovely black-bunny ones.
>Stuffed em in my pocket
>And i walked over to Birthday's underwear drawer

>And by that i mean i searched the room for like four minutes
trying to find it.
>Because fuck if i knew where she kept any of her clothing
>But i found it finally
>It was full of various unmentionables, and some very... uhh
>Lewd
>Objects that we're just not going to mention here.
>[spoiler]It's no secret that if you've ever been to a teenage
female's room[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]Any long, or even remotely phallic object has probably
been inside of her at one point.[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]Women like to pretend they aren't just as sex-crazed as
men, but they often are[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]From the typical hairbrush, to the often-requested
sharpie. To even odd objects like rulers, umbrella handles, and
vibrating toothbrushes[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]After a while they may find favorites, or they may keep
looking[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]But we can just say that i found where she kept her
favorites[/spoiler]

>Either way, i pulled out a pair of blue panties
>The girls were about the same waist size, i figured they would
fit.
>Then i spent a seriously painstaking three minutes trying to get
them back on without waking her up.
>Success
>Threw the blanket back over her
>And left
>I just hoped she hadn't been pretending to be asleep the entire
time.
>Would run all the fun
>Specially since i returned to the living room and mentioned
offhand that someone should probably wake up blondie
>and that i "Didn't feel like doing it"
>I winked at glasses a couple times
>She would get the idea
>She did
>She got up and went to wake blondie
>Left raven sleeping
>So i left her to have the couch alone, she was talking up half
of it anyway
>And i sat up front with Birthday

>I didn't actually have much time
>But i still had that burning question in the back of my mind
>Had to get it answered
>So i told her i had a question
>But i didn't ask it
>I put my hand on her leg
>No complaints so far, just a funny look
>Then i slid it all the way up her skirt.
>Skin all the way
>No panties
>I laughed
>I didn't have any intention of doing anything, but i just had to
know
>Even offered her back her old pair.
>I was amassing a panty-army in my pockets
>But she refused
>Said she liked the "Breeze"
>I laughed, pulled my hand away and stood up.
>She was still a tease, even if she didn't really like me.


>I mentioned that we should start thinking about food again
>Lunch was rather light, even if delicious
>Birthday gets up, notes we should probably move to the other
room to discuss it
>I agree, but take a couple seconds to grab a folded blanket in
the corner and throw it partially over raven.
>Birthday stares
>It's a mixture of worry and understanding.
>Like its saying "Yeah i'm worried about her too"
>I'm not really worried about her myself
>But it's what the pit in my stomach told me to do, and felt
better after i did it.
>I wish i had a couple more blankets to throw.
>We arrive to find a still groggy blondie half under the covers.
>Food is mentioned
>It's decided Birthday and Glasses are going to throw down some
soup and toast.
>Simple, canned, yummy
>Blondie gets up and starts to move towards the door before
stopping
>Looking down with a look of concentration on her face.
>Glasses and Birthday whisk off to whisk up some soup.
>Aka start a fire and wait

>I ask blondie how well she slept
>I get a "I had funny dreams" in return.
>Hahaha, i wonder what kind of "Funny" dreams
>I make sure to ask this question
>I get this long winded story
>">Well, i think i was in some kind of boat. Sailing on a huge
lake or ocean, it was beautiful"
>">Crisp blue as far as the eye could see, but silly me i managed
to hit the only rock for miles"
>">Boat kind of got a hole, and started taking on water"
>">But it was a nice warm day, the water was actually really
nice, and i managed to get to land while bailing most of it out"
>">Only my pants got wet"
>Well
>Th...
>Well
>Yeah
>Ok
>[spoiler]Most women won't have erotic dreams if you lick them
while they're sleeping.[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]Atleast none i've been with, because i've god damn
tried[/spoiler]
>I'm rather dejected, but atleast i got her pants wet
>Right guys
>Right?
