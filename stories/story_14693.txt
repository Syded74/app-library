Day 260

Jack made it to the door of the TARDIS this time before the damn Toclafane finally got to him. He had just about figured out how to get past them and through them, but they finally caught him. Even so, he figured out what he’d done wrong at the last moment.

When he awoke this time, it was to see the guards doing a half-assed patch job on the wall of his cell so they could reset the rings his chains were secured to. Here Jack had been thinking he was such a strong guy, that he’d been ripping his chains right out of the wall, only to find out the guards had been rigging it up this way the entire time.

Suddenly it all clicked into place for Jack. All of the failed escape attempts, all of the failed plans to defeat the Master -- they had been scouting expeditions. They had been reconnaissance missions. Why hadn’t Jack, career soldier and warrior, seen this before? Each time they failed, they learned something new. One of them learned some small, significant fact that they added to their knowledge base and used the next time. Yes, they were distracting the Master so he didn’t focus all of his energies on locating Martha. Yes, they disrupted his focus on his plans for destroying Earth long enough to distract him and slow his progress. Through it all, they learned.

The Doctor had a plan. The Doctor always had a plan. It wasn’t always immediately decipherable, but it would always be for the greater good. Jack had forgotten for a time those lessons he’d learned from the Doctor about selflessness and sacrifice. He hoped his extended pity party hadn’t slowed the progress of the information-gathering. If it had, it was water under the bridge. He was on board one hundred percent now, though. Whatever they needed him to do.

He knew full well he might cost the lives of Gwen, Ianto and Toshiko. He couldn’t let that stop him. The Doctor’s plan was to save the planet and anyone still alive down there. His team would never forgive him for putting them above humanity. If their lives meant the eventual overthrow of the Master, they would give them. They would ask only that Jack do anything and everything he could to see it actually happened.

Jack was smiling when the new guards chained him back up. For the first time in 260 days, Jack thought he had a reason to go on.

Day 261

Jack was hauled onto the command deck again. When the lift doors opened, he immediately looked around for the wooden cross but was relieved when he didn’t see it. Relief was quickly replaced by dread when he saw what was on the upper level. If he wasn’t mistaken, it was something commonly used in the time of Earth’s Spanish Inquisition called the rack.

Aw, hell.

Jack’s guards hauled him up the stairs, and he expected the stripping to begin. Instead he was forced to his knees, facing into the room.

The Master entered first, his face like thunder. He was as angry as Jack had ever seen him. He wondered what had gone wrong in the Master’s grand plan besides their latest attempt at escape, such as it was.

“Jack!” the Time Lord barked as he strode purposefully across the room and up the stairs. “I warned you. I warned you.”

Jack’s guards held him up as the Master backhanded him across the face.

“I told you the next time you defied me and martyred yourself you’d take one of your little team with you.” Jack didn’t think he’d ever seen the Master shake with rage before. That was a bonus. Still, Jack felt dread lying in his belly like a stone. If the Master’s statement meant what he feared it did…

Jack’s worst fears were realized when the lift opened to reveal Gwen, Ianto and Tosh dragged out of it by several armed guards. They seemed to all catch sight of him at once.

“Jack!” He heard each of them cry. All hell broke loose as they began to struggle against their captors. Gwen kicked out, Ianto executed a head butt and Tosh shoved hard against her guard, digging in and actually throwing him off balance.

“Stop! Stop! Stop! Ianto, Gwen, Toshiko! Stop!” Jack heard his voice crack in distress and his desire for them to cease their struggles or risk being hurt.

They heard him and they stopped fighting, but they didn’t relax in their bonds. They were ready to have another go at any second. God, but he was proud of them. They were as grimy as he was, their jeans and shirts as filthy as his own. They were still beautiful as far as he was concerned. They were smart and strong and still fighting. He couldn’t be more proud.

“Jack! We knew it was you,” Gwen said through her tears. “When we heard about the man on the Valiant who couldn’t die, we knew it was you.”

“The one and only, kids,” Jack gave them a brilliant smile, trying to be reassuring. “You three been behaving yourselves?”

“Hell, no,” Gwen said loudly, “They killed Owen right in front of me.”

“I know. He made me watch.”

That fired them all up again. Gwen tried to shake off her captors’ hands once again. Ianto and Tosh attempted to run their own guards into one another to throw them off balance. It actually took several moments for them to be subdued again.

Jack could only laugh at their bravado. Who was he kidding? It was bravery. And they all looked good. As filthy as they were, they looked healthy. They were being fed and they weren’t being harmed, at least not seriously.

“Enough with the touching reunion,” the Master said. “I warned you, Jack. The next time you defied me for one of the Doctor’s idiotic plans, one of your team was going to die right along with you. Pity is, you’ll come back from the whole ordeal but none of them will.”

Jack didn’t take his eyes from his team. It had been too long since he’d seen them. He was saddened by the fact that Owen was no longer with them, but he’d take his blessings where he could find them.

“What’s he talking about, Jack?” Gwen asked hesitantly.

“We’ve all been staging active revolts up here. After the last one I was told that if I participated the next time I’d have to watch one of you die.” There was no point in hiding anything from them. They were going to find out soon enough.

His team stood silently regarding him. “We tried not to get caught, Jack,” Ianto said.

Jack met Ianto’s gaze again and couldn’t believe what he saw there. He looked to Tosh and then to Gwen and realized they all wore the same expression. They felt they had let him down when they’d been captured. They were being used against him and they blamed themselves. It hadn’t occurred to any of them that he should not try to escape even if it meant they had to forfeit their own lives.

“I hear you all raised some hell before they got you,” Jack told them, letting his pride show in his voice and his eyes. “I couldn’t have asked for more from you.”

The Master stood beside Jack slowly clapping his hands in a mocking manner. “Touching yet still nauseating,” he said with disgust. “Pick one, Jack.”

Jack’s eyes shot to the Master’s as his words sank in. He was being made to choose which of his team would die today. He looked back at the three of them and saw that they understood what was happening.

He couldn’t choose. He couldn’t sentence one of them to death. Jack shook his head in refusal.

“Choose one, Jack, or all three will die.”

Jack’s blood ran cold and he saw Gwen’s eyes widen. Ianto’s jaw dropped and Toshiko covered her mouth with both bound hands.

Jack considered quickly. He had to doom one to save two. Not Gwen, she fired them up. Kept them fighting. Not Tosh, she just might find a way to bring down Archangel yet. Not Ianto…not his Ianto. Jack knew he could not watch Ianto die in front of him. Looking back at Gwen, he caught sight of the steely determination in her eyes. She nodded at him slightly. She was volunteering.

In that moment Jack realized it almost made sense. Ianto and Tosh were one another’s support system. Yes, they all drew strength from one another but the friendship between Tosh and Ianto empowered them each just a little bit more. To take one of them away from the other would weaken the whole.

A look of understanding passed between he and Gwen and then Jack spoke. “Gwen.”

“PC Cooper, come on down,” the Master said in a twisted imitation of a quiz show host.

Tosh and Ianto let out cries of dismay and protest. They tried to interfere with the guards, who dragged Gwen to the Master.

“Tosh! Ianto! This is how it has to be,” Gwen yelled at them over her shoulder. “I volunteered. It needs to be me. Don’t blame Jack.”

When she was forced to kneel at the Master’s feet she glared up at him, hostile and defiant. “Don’t stop resisting,” she shouted. “Don’t ever give up.”

The Master produced a large, clear plastic bag and without hesitation slid it over Gwen’s head. She began to struggle immediately. She tried to draw her bound hands up to claw away the plastic but her guards held her fast. The Master secured the bag around her neck with a thick, black tape. Her struggles caused her to use whatever air she had that much faster. Jack suspected that was her intent. 

He watched in horror as Gwen Cooper suffocated in front of him. As she struggled to breathe, her face distorted as it was pressed against the bag, her movements became sluggish. Jack watched as the life left her eyes and she collapsed against the guards at the Master’s feet.

Gwen was dead.

“Get her out of here,” the Master said with disgust as he toed her lifeless body. He took the steps two at a time until he stood in front of Jack. “Let’s hope you learned your lesson, Captain,” he said.

Jack glared up at the Master with undisguised hatred, and in that moment he decided he would anything and everything he could think of to bring this Time Lord down.

His attention was drawn back to Ianto and Tosh at the back of the room where they had collapsed against one another. Tosh sobbed softly against Ianto as he held her against him, running his hands over her back. At the sight of them he knew he had made the right choice.

“Now it’s time for your real punishment, Jack.” He was pulled to his feet and his guards began to strip off his clothes.

“No!” Jack roared. He struggled against the hands that held him. He’d never done this before, fought his guards. They were caught off guard and looked to the Master in fear and confusion. “Not in front of them.” Jack said, inclining his head toward Ianto and Tosh.

“What, in our long association, Jack, has led you to think I would take any request you make into consideration?” the Master asked incredulously.

“You want my cooperation and my submission, don’t you?”

“I have that.”

“Until I take it back.”

The Master regarded Jack with something akin to surprise. “Since you desperately don’t want your remaining kiddies to witness your pain and humiliation, I find I really want them here for this.”

“If you keep them here for this I won’t go anywhere or do anything with you without one hell of a fight,” Jack leaned in so he could lower his voice just above a whisper. “I won’t suck your cock nicely anymore. I won’t lie beneath you and pretend to be enjoying myself. I’ll bite, scratch, punch and kick and I won’t care how you hurt me in retaliation. I can take it. I can die and come right back so I have nothing to fear.”

The Master took a step back. He regarded Jack for a long moment. “Get those two out of here,” he said over his shoulder. “Take them back planet-side.”

When their guards stood them up, Jack heard Ianto and Tosh shouting.
“Get out of here,” Jack shouted back. “Go back to the surface. Stay alive. Any way you can.”

Jack’s last image of them was of their desperate expressions as Ianto and Toshiko were pulled backward into the lift by the guards. They all managed to smile at one another just before the doors slid shut.

Day 261

Jack was hauled onto the command deck again. When the lift doors opened, he immediately looked around for the wooden cross but was relieved when he didn’t see it.

I can die and come right back so I have nothing to fear.”

The Master took a step back. He regarded Jack for a long moment. “Get those two out of here,” he said over his shoulder. “Take them back planet-side.”

When their guards stood them up, Jack heard Ianto and Tosh shouting.

“Get out of here,” Jack shouted back. “Go back to the surface. Stay alive. Any way you can.”

Jack’s last image of them was of their desperate expressions as Ianto and Toshiko were pulled backward into the lift by the guards. They all managed to smile at one another just before the doors slid shut.

When the doors had closed on Tosh’s and Ianto’s exit, Jack relaxed and submitted to the guards once again. They removed his clothes and he offered no resistance. He caught the Master watching him carefully.

“I had no idea it was so important to you that your little team not see you weak and helpless,” the Master said, as if he’d just discovered something new and delightful.

“It matters to me that they don’t lose hope,” he said, but it was only half the truth. The Master had been right; Jack was horrified at the idea of Ianto seeing him naked, bound, bloody and dying.

The guards finished stripping him and then lifted Jack onto the rack. His torso was placed over three rolling tubes with dozens of sharp spikes all along their surfaces. His wrists and ankles were secured at either end by rough ropes. The Master stepped up and once again tortured Jack himself.

Each crank of the lever at Jack’s feet pulled his limbs further from his body. Each turn stretched him further and further until his arms felt like they were about to be pulled from his shoulders and his legs were about to be yanked from his hips.

Jack screamed with abandon. He’d been through worse, quite recently in fact. This was nothing. Jack felt at peace today. He’d seen his team. Toshiko and Ianto were alive and healthy. Together they had formed their own little internal resistance cell.

As Jack’s first shoulder slipped from its socket, he didn’t care. He’d faced his worst fear – causing the death of one of his team. Gwen had helped him face it and had given him absolution for his decision in the end. As his second shoulder slipped from its socket, Jack didn’t care. He’d seen Ianto. Jack’s legs slipped from their own sockets at almost the same time, as he lost consciousness. Jack’s last conscious thought was of Toshiko and just how beautiful and brilliant she was.

…………………………………………………….

When Jack roused he was more than a little surprised to find he was still on the rack, still in pain and that his bones were still out of joint. He groaned and started to look around for an explanation.

“Captain, try to relax,” he heard Francine say from somewhere near him.

“Why haven’t I healed?” he croaked through his pain.

“We don’t know,” Francine answered with desperation in her voice.

“Where is he?” Jack asked, trying to look around.

“He left. Something happened planet-side that sent him into a fit and he just left.” He felt her gentle hands stroke his face soothingly. “We’ve untied you but you don’t seem to be healing.”

“Kill him,” came a soft voice from somewhere on the lower level.

“What?” Francine asked in confusion.

“Kill him.” Jack realized it was the Doctor who’d spoken. “It will reset his body. It’s in death that he heals.”

“Yes,” Jack concurred, realizing he was right. Leave it to the Doctor to know how this whole thing worked.

“But...how?” Francine asked.

“Doesn’t matter,” Jack gasped through his pain. “Just do it.”

“I can’t kill you, Captain,” Francine sounded appalled.

“You have to. It’s okay, Francine,” he reassured her.

“Here,” a male voice said. “A knife to the heart will be the safest and probably the most humane.” The face of the guard who had been with Jack the longest and shown him the most courtesy and respect appeared just above him. He produced the long, wicked blade that the Master always seemed to wield. “I’ll be as quick as I can,” he said to Jack, tightening his grip on the hilt.

“Hurry,” Jack groaned.

In the end it went pretty well compared to Jack’s recent deaths. The guard made a clean and accurate strike, and he died quickly and mercifully. ……………………………………………………………………

No one was ever sure why the Master lost almost all interest in torturing Jack. Rumors were everywhere that Martha Jones was making her way back to the U.K. The Master seemed to always be just a few steps behind her. The Resistance was growing and the willing informants planet-side were fewer and further between. Toshiko continued to try to crash Archangel with Ianto’s help and support.

The Toclafane were still killing anyone who looked sideways at one of them, and the Master continued to slowly kill the planet as he tried to march onward toward his new Time Lord Empire. It became a race against time. Could he kill the planet and launch his war on the universe before they stopped him?

The attention the Master used to pay to Jack seemed to shift instead to the Doctor. He teased and taunted him, increasing the humiliations he heaped on his fellow Time Lord until they were a daily, eventually an hourly, occurrence. The Doctor never stopped organizing escape attempts, and perhaps in the end, combating those along with all the other troubles that were being thrown his way was what finally brought the Master’s wrath down solely on the Doctor.

Sometime around Day 300, the Master’s manic jovialness seemed to morph into something a little more unhinged. The self-congratulatory parties he threw in the control room seemed more forced than they had been previously. More and more beautiful young women prowled the corridors of the Valiant, but none seemed to please him like they used to. His treatment of Lucy became dark and violent. More often than not she sported a black eye or a fat lip and the vacant look in her eyes was constantly present.

As of Day 310, Jack spent nearly every moment of every day and night chained in his cell. His only respite was when he broke free and tried once again to make it to the TARDIS. As always, the Toclafane got him at the last second. He’d wake up in his cell and his guards would patch the wall half-heartedly so Jack could pull out his restraints the next time. Since the Master never arranged for visits anymore, Jack stopped getting showers and Tish and Francine never had another chance to try to launder his clothes. By Day 320 Jack couldn’t stand to be around himself.

Around Day 365 rumors were rampant that Martha Jones was back on British soil. The Doctor organized their final escape attempt. They executed it on the day the Master got hold of Martha and brought her back to the Valiant. The Master’s outrage at the Doctor snatching up of his laser screwdriver led him to resurrect the television signals so the world could watch him age the Doctor beyond recognition. Jack watched from his cell as the Master delivered his message to Martha Jones.

…………………………………..

Jack was thrilled to see Martha looking so well. The last year couldn’t have been much easier on her than it had been on him, and if she died, it would be permanent. He was amazed at the Doctor’s plan, the plan that Martha had spent a year putting into action. As soon as the Doctor was restored, it was up to Jack to put into action all that he had learned about getting past the Toclafane and into the TARDIS. This time, though, he had help.

With the Master neutralized and no longer a threat to their loved ones, Jack’s guards were willing and able to help. Jack got into the TARDIS and destroyed the Paradox Machine. Shortly after he got back to the command bridge, the entire year had reset itself. Jack was light headed with relief and joy when he realized his team was intact, alive and most likely somewhere in Tibet making their way home. Owen had to be pissed off that they’d been sent on a wild goose chase, but Jack didn’t care. He was alive. Gwen was alive. None of them would have any memory whatsoever of the year that now never was, never had been.

……………………………………………….

Jack stood quietly over the Doctor as the Time Lord cradled the lifeless body of the Master against his own. The grief was palpable in the room. Jack felt his heart ache with compassion for the Doctor. He’d thought himself alone for centuries, found out another of his kind still lived, and then that person had been taken from him so that he was once again alone. The sobs that shook the Doctor’s shoulders were heartrending. Jack knew that pain, the familiar pain and desolation of loss.

Jack’s emotions about the Master were mixed, and that surprised him. He looked on as the Time Lord he loved cradled the one who had hurt and humiliated him continuously during the past year. Part of Jack hated the Master with every fiber of his being. Remembering the times he’d been taken to the Master’s bedchamber, the times he’d been murdered in horrific ways, Jack had a sudden inclination to grab up the Time Lord’s dead form, toss it out a door and let it plummet down to the Earth below. Drawing and quartering him, even though he was beyond feeling the pain, seemed like a satisfying option, too. One bullet wasn’t enough, to Jack’s way of thinking. He’d like to put a few more in himself.

Another part of Jack knew the Master had been sick and afraid and hadn’t known how to cope, so he’d become a bully. He had tried to control his own fear and exorcise his own shame at his cowardice by controlling a planet and bending its people to his will. Jack realized the Master didn’t deserve his hatred. Only his pity.

The Doctor continued to hold the Master’s body to himself as silent tears streaked down his face. He looked as broken as Jack should feel. Instead he felt only a sense of relief that the psychotic Time Lord was dead. The past year had never existed except in the memories of those who had been on the Valiant’s bridge when time had reset. Jack had his memories sure enough, and they weren’t pretty. But it was over and he was thankful for that. He could and he would heal. To hang on to his hatred would only eat at him, knaw at his guts until he didn’t just hate the Master, but also himself and all those around him who might try to reach out.

Thinking of those who would reach out to him, Jack spun around and looked for the women who had been his saviors in the past year. He found them at the back of the room, huddled together and weeping. He started toward them.

Martha saw Jack first when she looked up from her mother’s tight embrace. She graced him with a wide smile and stepped in to hug him.

“Ugh!” she wrinkled her nose at him. “Jack, you stink.”

He laughed at her, relieved at feeling lighthearted enough to laugh after so long. “Your mother has been trying to get me to wash behind my ears, but I just don’t learn.”

“I’m surprised she didn’t pin you down and make you wash behind them.”

He leaned down and whispered in Martha’s ear, “I run fast, she couldn’t catch me.”

Jack released Martha to go to Francine and draw her into a tight embrace, “Thank you,” he said into her ear, “for everything.”

Francine’s eyes flooded with tears once again. “You are so very welcome, Captain.”

“Jack,” he corrected and placed a chaste kiss on her lips.

“Jack,” Francine repeated dutifully.

He cradled her face between his hands. “You were the caretaker of my sanity this past year.”

“And you are my hero.”

Humbled, Jack place a kiss on her forehead, then turned to locate Tish. She stood in the circle of her father’s arms. He took her hand and drew her to himself.

“Thank you,” he whispered as he hugged her tightly, “and I’m sorry you had to go through this with me.”

Tish clutched at Jack’s shirt and shook her head against his chest, “You have nothing to apologize for. I wish there had been more I could have done for you.”

Jack pulled back and kissed her on each of her cheeks before releasing her back to her father’s care. He turned once again to Martha.

“So Martha,” Jack said as he slung an arm around her shoulders, “Done anything interesting lately?”

“Oh, you know,” she said in a casual tone, “I kicked around Europe for a while, got chased by Toclafane on multiple continents, convinced an entire resistance movement to say the same word at the same time on the same day. The usual.”

Jack laughed again and kissed her cheek. “Thank you.”

“Thank you, Jack,” she countered with a serious expression. “It would have been for nothing if you hadn’t rescued the TARDIS.”

“Took me long enough to figure out how to do that.”

“You figured it out when it mattered.” They clung to one another for several long moments before Jack remembered the Doctor. He turned to look at the two huddled Time Lords across the room.

“He looks broken,” he heard Martha say.

“He’s alone again.”

“Can we do something for him?”

“You stay with your family. I’ll see to the Doctor.”

Jack quietly approached the Doctor and the Master’s body. He stared down at the smooth features of the Master’s face as he lay still in death. He felt the last of his hatred and resentment bleed away. He’d given the Master all he was going to give him. He was keeping the rest. Maybe he’d give a little bit more to Ianto this time.

The Master had viewed him as a freak to be experimented on and tortured as if he were a non-sentient. Worthy only of cruel experimentation. Jack knew he had a purpose, now. He’d learned what that purpose was during the past year. He had been given a gift. It was not a curse. He was not a freak and he was not wrong. He was going to take himself home to his team because he loved them and they loved him and together they did important work.

The Doctor’s sobs subsided, and it was time to start moving on. For all of them. “Doctor,” Jack kept his voice low, “how can I help you?”

Without looking up the Doctor answered, “I’d like to get him down to the surface. Someplace remote where I can light the traditional pyre.”

“I can help you with that. I even know a good spot.”

“Thank you, Jack,” he heard the Doctor whisper against the Master’s hair.

“I’m sorry for what you went through, Jack,” the Doctor said to him after they disposed of the Master’s body.

“So am I, Doctor,” Jack replied.

“I would have stopped him if I could have.”

“I know.”

“Thank you for your help this past year. You realize it was your ability to get into the TARDIS that ended this entire nightmare?”

“You’re welcome, Doctor. But I did it as much for Martha, her family and my team as I did for you.”

“All stellar reasons,” The Doctor paused. “You’re a very brave man, Jack. I hadn’t realized just how brave until now.”

“Dying for you on the Game Station wasn’t a clue?”

The Doctor sighed heavily. “I didn’t know what to do about you. You scared me a little. I just wanted to be away.”

“Well, I’ve found my place with Torchwood and my team. I’m not your responsibility anymore.”

“They’re lucky to have you, Captain.”

“I’m lucky to have them.”

When the Doctor said Jack could him, he was surprised that he really didn’t want to go. His heart and his mind were already back that the Hub; his body just needed to follow. He was proud of his work with Torchwood and he was back to continue it. He was proud of his team and he was back to lead them and guide them.

Before too much time passed he needed to get Ianto alone so he could start showing thathan a passing office romance. Jack shook his head and laughed at himself. How could he spend a year being chained, tortured, raped and killed over and over and still be nervous of the welcome home he was going to receive from Ianto?

He’d sort it later. Right now he couldn’t run across the Plass fast enough.
