Sophie is studying English literature, but she is having trouble paying the loan she took for that. Odd jobs don't last much, and the bank is sending increasingly threatening letters.

When they are about to add penalties to her debt that will make it forever impossible to pay, and her landlord is about to kick her out of her small rented apartment, the bank finally offers a deal. She gets some more time if she takes a job from some of its clients, under conditions fixed by them.

The client turns out to be an organizer of events. They offer her a job as some sort of cosplay hostess in a comic/videogame convention. As part of the job she has to dress with a slutty cosplay attire, somewhat ridiculous, and physically uncomfortable too. She will have to smile to everybody, accept all kind of jokes from nerds passing by, accepting to pose for pictures smiling and being nice despite feeling denigrated, and maybe even participate in some sort of videogame-inspired competition where if she loses, she takes real physical blows.
