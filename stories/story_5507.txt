    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>On Wednesday, August 29th, 2000, there were tearful and sad
    goodbyes as <br>
    the Williams family waited to board the aircraft that would take them from <br>
    Tehran back home to the U.S. and begin a new life. Narisa's heartfelt and <br>
    sad farewell to her family, a family she'd never see again was especially <br>
    painful to witness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>It was especially painful for all in the Williams family to watch
    as Narisa <br>
    sobbed in her mother's arms crying, &quot;Oh, Momma, I love you so much and
    <br>
    my heart is breaking! What am I going to do? How will I ever make it <br>
    without you! You are my dearest and closest friend. Who can I turn to for <br>
    guidance?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Hush now, my child. I will always be right there with you in
    your heart <br>
    and you in mine. We're Iranian women, remember? It's up to us to take <br>
    care of our families. You have a husband that loves you - would lay down <br>
    his life for you. Take strength in that. He will be your partner in life
    Trust <br>
    him with your heart, your feelings and even your fears. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;You have a mother-in-law that calls you daughter. Accept her
    love and <br>
    claim her as your own. Trust her like you trust me. Go to her and have the <br>
    same talks like we've had. She will advise you as I would - I'm sure of it.
    So <br>
    you see? You're not alone and you can make your new life one of joy, of <br>
    love and hope for the future. I have taught you to be a good wife. Now is
    the <br>
    time for you to leave and start your own family. I truly thank Allah for <br>
    giving me you as my child and I know He will be your strength. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Go, Daughter, and make me proud. Never forget your heritage
    or your <br>
    faith. It's up to you to lead your husband, for you are the stronger one. <br>
    Establish yourself as the dominant force in your home and put your family <br>
    and your husband first. If you do that, he will trust and follow your <br>
    direction. Always make sure your decisions are selfless with regard to your
    <br>
    family and do what your heart knows is right. Don't be misled by their <br>
    society. Keep the traditions - honor, chastity and family and most of all, <br>
    what's right in the sight of God. Protect those traditions with your
    life&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;I will, Momma. Just wait and see. I will grow up just like
    you for you are <br>
    my role model and idol. I love you, Momma and it feels like my heart is <br>
    broken into pieces. Goodbye, Momma. I'll miss you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Goodbye, Narisa. I will pray for you every day knowing that
    you will make <br>
    Allah and me proud. Know this my child: I will miss and think of you until <br>
    my last breath. Now go, go make your farewells to your father and <br>
    brother.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Mother and child tightly embraced and kissed each other for the
    last time. <br>
    Narisa made her way into her father's arms and continued to sob.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;There, there, Princess, don't cry. You're a woman now and
    must leave my <br>
    house and begin a new life with your husband. Josh is a good man and you <br>
    have a good family to support you. When I imagine all the beauty and <br>
    wonder of this world, I only see your mother, Rafi and you. I'll miss you, <br>
    pray for you and remember your beautiful eyes. I make this vow to you, <br>
    Daughter: I will live long enough to look into the eyes of your children
    and <br>
    I know I'll see your eyes again.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Oh Daddy! You have been my hero and I measure all men in the
    world <br>
    against you. I will miss our games together and your reassuring hugs. I'm <br>
    so sorry for disappointing you and getting into trouble. I know that I've <br>
    embarrassed you and brought you shame. Can you ever forgive me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Hush now, child. You did no such thing! You could not and
    have never <br>
    brought me shame. You did nothing wrong. You're a young girl and acted <br>
    like one. You have a husband that saved your life and for that, I praise <br>
    Allah. Look to him for <i>he</i> will now be your protector. Sometimes,
    Princess, <br>
    we know not why things happen. All we can do is trust in God for He knows <br>
    our hearts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;I believe that Allah brought these events upon us to bring
    you and Josh <br>
    together. He's a good man and has been an honorable husband to you. Be <br>
    his strength and driving force in life and your family will prosper. If I
    know <br>
    you - and your mother - he will become as trained as I (sniffled giggles). <br>
    You're a strong girl and my faith in you is unwavering. Your mother has <br>
    taught you well and now it's time for you to take those lessons and make <br>
    your own way in the world. There will be times when you are lonely, tired, <br>
    frustrated and unsure of yourself, but if you draw strength on your
    heritage <br>
    and faith, Allah will see you through it all. Trust in your husband and
    your <br>
    new family, your heritage and the lessons we've tried to impart to you and <br>
    look to Allah for strength and direction and you will prevail. Now kiss
    your <br>
    Papa goodbye because it's not good for people to see a police chief cry <br>
    (more sniffled giggles).&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Rafi, my sweet brother, I love you and will miss you
    terribly.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Rafi broke down sobbing as he spoke to his sister, &quot;Oh
    Narisa, I'm so sorry! <br>
    All of this is my fault. If I had gotten there sooner none of this would
    have <br>
    happened. I feel so ashamed!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Sweet brother, don't feel bad. All of this is Allah's doing
    and is His <br>
    purpose for my life. Don't feel sad because we all have our lives to live <br>
    according to His will. Let's be happy for the years we've shared and be <br>
    grateful for God's gifts. One of the most precious of those is my beloved <br>
    brother. Find a good girl like Momma and have lots of happy babies. One <br>
    day our children will be together and play, just like you and I have and
    they <br>
    will know the love of God. Kiss me, Rafi, and be happy for me. I've never <br>
    once blamed you for what's happened and I never will. Be at peace with <br>
    God and yourself. I love you and will miss you terribly. Now kiss me <br>
    goodbye.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Brother and sister kissed each other cheeks and Narisa took her
    brother's <br>
    face in her hands and placed a gentle kiss on his lips.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>While Narisa was saying goodbye to her family, Josh was doing the
    same <br>
    with his friends. He bade farewell to his in-laws behind Narisa. Even <br>
    farewells have to end, but with every farewell there's a new adventure on <br>
    the horizon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>They boarded their flight at 5:55 and took off at 6:15. As the
    plane banked <br>
    and lifted up into the clear, blue summer skies over Tehran, Narisa looked <br>
    back sobbing for a family and a homeland she'd never see again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>It took Josh a good hour during the flight to get Narisa calmed
    down. As <br>
    soon as she seemed okay, she'd start the waterworks all over again. She <br>
    told him through her new mom that the thought of never seeing her family <br>
    again, especially her mother, seemed unbearable now that it was a reality <br>
    and she'd actually left Tehran.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh just pulled up the armrest between them and held her. There
    wasn't <br>
    much else he could do. He thought to himself, <i>If I was leaving <b>my</b>
    parents <br>
    forever, I have no idea how I'd handle it - probably no better than Narisa <br>
    is. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>After she'd cried herself out, she slept the last two of the
    five-hour flight. <br>
    Josh woke her up when the seatbelt sign came on and were instructed to <br>
    prepare for landing. She awoke red-eyed from crying and her face was a <br>
    little puffy. When they landed in London, they learned that the State <br>
    Department didn't waste any time: they were waiting for them.<br>
    <br>
    Stanley Wiseman, the Assistant Secretary of State that arranged for <br>
    Narisa's asylum along with several security personnel, met them as they <br>
    disembarked from the aircraft. They were escorted to a private conference <br>
    room where he began to prepare them for their arrival at Dulles. Everyone <br>
    was surprised to learn that they wouldn't be continuing their regular
    flight, <br>
    but instead would be flown to Washington on a government jet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>He explained that the press was waiting for them in force,
    expecting them <br>
    to arrive on a commercial flight. He told the family that he would be <br>
    making a government-approved statement and that he would answer most <br>
    of the press' questions. Then Steven, Josh's dad and Marie, his mother, if <br>
    she wished to, would speak and give their statements and take questions if <br>
    they so desired. Mr. Wiseman advised that it would be best if Narisa and <br>
    Josh didn't appear or speak to journalists because they were minors. U.S. <br>
    law prevents the press from publishing any details regarding the teens such
    <br>
    as names, personal details or information other than their ages and some <br>
    of the details of the incident in Tehran. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>The details of their arrest, trials and release were murky areas
    in that Marie <br>
    and Steven had to be careful of what they said because by asking carefully <br>
    crafted probing questions, the press hoped that some of this information <br>
    would be accidentally revealed. Any statement or information given by the <br>
    guardians of minor children could be printed. The press was hungry for the <br>
    juicy details: two young teens pulled from the brink of death only by <br>
    marrying one another. It was a story that had them all salivating. All of <br>
    them were starting to get apprehensive as they thought about the <br>
    prospective events following their landing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Having been prepared, the Williams family was escorted through a
    private <br>
    area and hustled into a shuttle bus and driven to a hangar where they <br>
    boarded a small jet. Fifteen minutes later they were airborne on their last
    <br>
    leg home, compliments of Uncle Sam. The plane was a lot more <br>
    comfortable than a commercial flight and they were served a hot meal once <br>
    they were underway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>None of them could really rest because they were so anxious about
    what <br>
    was to happen when they landed. The tension only served to make the <br>
    flight seem longer than it really was. Josh thought to himself, <i>I was <br>
    nervous about going over there and now, I'm more nervous about coming <br>
    back!<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh cuddled his tiny wife to help ease her obvious fear of the
    unknown. <br>
    She was still morose over the loss of her family. While she slept on the <br>
    plane, she'd utter &quot;Momma&quot; several times in her sleep. Add to
    that, in Iran, <br>
    she was a convicted prostitute; what would the world press do with<i> that</i>
    <br>
    information?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>After what seemed like forever, they were circling Washington D.
    C. <br>
    waiting for clearance to land. Once on the ground and the plane had taxied <br>
    to a hangar, they were again loaded onto a shuttle that drove them to the <br>
    terminal. They were told their luggage would be taken care of and loaded in
    <br>
    the van that would drive them home. After some last-minute preparations, <br>
    the family was seated in an anteroom next to the pressroom and was told <br>
    they could watch the press conference on closed circuit TV. Then, if either
    <br>
    of the parents wished to make a statement, they would be called in. Steven <br>
    Williams said he'd like to make a statement and Mr. Wiseman told him he <br>
    would bring him in at the appropriate time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Everyone attentively watched the screen and the lone podium with
    the <br>
    State Department seal on a blue-curtained backdrop and the murmurings <br>
    of reporters waiting for someone to appear. After several minutes, Mr. <br>
    Wiseman walked into the room and up to the rostrum and the room <br>
    suddenly became quiet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Good evening, ladies and gentleman, it's such a pleasant
    surprise to see all <br>
    of you here tonight instead of being at home with your families (chuckles <br>
    from the press).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;At this time, I'd like to take a moment and say that for our
    citizens <br>
    traveling abroad, we would hope that they visit the State Department's <br>
    website and review any precautions that should be taken when traveling <br>
    abroad and to remember that U.S. citizens are bound by the laws of the <br>
    countries they visit. These countries may have far more serious penalties <br>
    for certain offenses than exist in the Unites States. We are here tonight
    to <br>
    report the resolution of a situation involving the arrest, detention and
    trial <br>
    of a U.S. citizen by authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Through <br>
    delicate negotiations and diplomacy, a successful conclusion was <br>
    achieved.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh thought<i>, Delicate negotiations and diplomacy my ass! What
    were <br>
    they doing while I sat in that prison? Where were they when they <br>
    convicted and sentenced us to death? It's just like the government to take <br>
    credit for something they didn't do.</i> He then continued to listen as Mr.
    <br>
    Wiseman went on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Now to the topic at hand: On July twelfth the teenaged son
    of American <br>
    citizens - a minor I might add - intervened in an incident involving
    Iranian <br>
    police authorities and a young teenaged girl being charged for offenses <br>
    under Islamic law. The boy felt a moral responsibility to act because he <br>
    truly believed her life was in danger. As a result, he was arrested,
    charged <br>
    and tried for interfering with the internal affairs of the Islamic Republic
    of <br>
    Iran and accosting a female citizen of their country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;At this time, we would like to acknowledge the Iranian
    government in <br>
    demonstrating moderation and restraint while exercising compassion in <br>
    bringing this matter to a successful resolution. Are there any
    questions?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Is it true he was charged with rape? How old is he&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;No, that's incorrect, he is fourteen. Next?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Besides being charged with interfering in the internal
    affairs in a police <br>
    matter, exactly what else was he charged with?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Defiling a Muslim girl. Next?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;She's thirteen. You: over there in the blue.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;What was the girl being charged with and why did he
    intervene?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;She was unaccompanied on the street without a male relative
    and was <br>
    charged with a crime against public chastity. She was reportedly being <br>
    stoned at the time of intervention.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;There were reports that she was a prostitute. Is that
    true?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;That is blatantly false. She's an innocent young girl much
    like any other <br>
    girl her age around the world.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Is it true they had to get married?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;The marital status of minors - single or married - and any
    other personal <br>
    information is not open for discussion.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Yes, she has been granted asylum by the U.S.
    government.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Why was she granted asylum? Is it because she's become a
    member of the <br>
    Williams family?'&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Mr. Wiseman introduced Josh's father saying that Mr. Steven
    Williams <br>
    wanted to say a few words. Mr. Wiseman stood off to the left and behind <br>
    Mr. Williams. The room became quiet again as Steve stepped up to the <br>
    rostrum and began his statement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;I would like to thank the State Department for all its help
    in bringing our <br>
    family home. I'd just like to say that my wife, Marie, and I have spent our
    <br>
    entire adult lives in the pursuit of our love for Persian history, its
    people, <br>
    customs and culture and this incident hasn't diminished that love - not one
    <br>
    whit - and we will continue that pursuit. We would also like to express our
    <br>
    heartfelt gratitude to the Iranian government for its clemency in this
    case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;I would like to remind all of you that the details you seek
    the most involve <br>
    the personal lives and futures of two young people. They have been through <br>
    some very trying and traumatic events and need time to heal and get on <br>
    with their lives. I am now asking that you, the press, give them their <br>
    privacy and respect their rights to live their lives as normally as
    possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Make no mistake: If my wife and I feel that the press is in
    any way <br>
    investigating, intervening or intruding on their privacy, we will fight
    with <br>
    every resource we have and every fiber in our beings to protect them. Your <br>
    &quot;right to publish&quot; under the first amendment, for the sake of a
    provocative <br>
    story, is superceded by the rights of two minors to live their lives in
    peace. <br>
    Thank you very much.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>As Steven turned and left the podium, multiple questions were
    being <br>
    shouted from the gallery of reporters all at once. He remained silent and <br>
    left, followed by Mr. Wiseman's announcement &quot;I'm afraid that's all
    for <br>
    now, thank you all for coming.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Again, now away from any crowds, the reporters and
    curiosity-seekers, the <br>
    family thanked Mr. Wiseman for all his help and support. They were then <br>
    led through the private hallways of the terminal to an awaiting van to take
    <br>
    them home. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>As they sped through the darkness of night along I-495 to their
    new home <br>
    in Virginia, Josh pondered what tomorrow and the future held in store for <br>
    his Persian Princess and him. Narisa meanwhile was thinking the very <br>
    same thing as she sat enfolded in Josh's arms. They would embark on a <br>
    new journey together and start of a new life. Together, as a young married <br>
    couple, they would cling to each other as they ventured forth into the
    future <br>
    on a new beginning<o:p></o:p></span></p>
