>Well maybe that was a tad bit of an over dramatic place to leave
off
>Yeah the entire scene of Glasses dragging blondie kicking and
screaming out of a closet
>The girl i had up until moments ago, been having a warm set of
comfy intimacy with.
>After she had attempted to murder me multiple times of course
>That just made it hotter.
>[spoiler]no it didnt[/spoiler]

>Imagine if you will, as i fumble after them over boxes of shoes
clambering and grasping out with my hands
>Lets go over the expressions that crossed our faces one by one
>Glasses dragging blondie away with her characteristic evil smile
>Blondie with a mixture of confusion and fear in her eyes
>[spoiler]you know, that kind of innocent fear you get when
someone's dragging you off without your permission, but you know
you're probably safe[/spoiler]

>[spoiler]but around glasses who knows[/spoiler]
>If i'm honest i probably didn't really have an expression on
>Maybe some surprise when i realized i was no longer being
tickled and blondie
>MY BLONDIE
>was being dragged off
>but for the most part you can't really hold an expression as
you're trying to escape a closet full of boxes and coats
>Well until the door was slammed in my face
>I'd love to imagine i donned the exact woody face that i posted
up above.

>But i mean this is really just overdramatized

>I just stood up and opened the door

>BLINDING LIGHT

>WHY DIDN'T I WEAR MY EYEPATCH TODAY

>i instantly regret not turning off HDR in the video settings.

>of course, having transitioned to my vampire state while within
the closet, i flail around blindly screaming

>"My eyes!"

>"The Sunlight it burns!"

>After which i began sparkling and romanced all the girls
effortlessly, because i guess vampires don't die from sun anymore
in popular media. (yeah, twilight is really that old)

>[spoiler]Which in layman's terms means i stood there blinking
for a couple seconds trying to get my bearings[/spoiler]

>this is really just a fancy way of saying i was actually blind
for a good 15 seconds.

>that was too many puns in a row, (sorry).
>I couldn't see anything going on clearly because the glare of
the sun was streaming in through the window
>but i could hear scuffling and blondie making various "Help i'm
being dragged off against my will noises"
>You know those sounds girls make when you grab them off the
street and shove them into your van
>You know the ones

>She was making those noises, and it sounded like glasses was
actually having trouble with her
>Probably getting kicked in the chest/face as she was dragging
the feet of a very resistant opponent.
>Definitely a couple "Ommpfhs" so blondie was getting some great
hits in.
>Either way, i can't do anything but wait, so i just get to enjoy
the sounds of the two scuffling
>They aren't getting farther away
>But they're still hitting one another, the bed is creaking and
they're both breathing in pretty big gasps

>I'm throwing puzzle pieces together trying to figure out what's
happening
>Oh wait sight's returning
>Blondie has a firm grip on the bottom of the bed's baseboard
>She's practically upside down being pulled by glasses who's
trying to dislodge her
>Glasses is obviously having a hard time keeping a hold of her
>She's holding one of blondie's legs with a hefty amount of slack
in the pajama pants, and the other by the ankle.
>Poor blondie looks like she's being swept away by a strong river
current
>Her pajama bottoms are pulled down enough to show her buttcheeks
to the world

>Perfect half-moon globes of flesh

>Her pajama top is completely open, but she's contorted her upper
body in a twist to hold onto the baseboard of the bed, so her
breasts are in "I'm using muscles mode" and its not as visually
delightful as you would imagine.
>Which to me is always has its allures, something that smaller
breasts always do and big ones can't.
>[spoiler]For those of you who haven't been with women in various
states of undress in reality, breasts are not always big jiggling
things that hang out in front of the girl's chest[/spoiler]
>[spoiler] when they stretch in various positions, may it be
putting on a shirt, yoga, or lying down, women with smaller
breasts have the breasts shrink in prominence completely and
change shape to be much less prominent.[/spoiler]

>[spoiler] this is completely underrepresented in porn, or
frankly most if not all forms of media with sex involved, but its
just the way human muscles work[/spoiler]
>[spoiler] just thought you might be interested in what i meant
when i said "Muscles Mode": Yw Lonely Anons[/spoiler]

>Either way, as an example of how hard blondie was gripping the
bed baseboard at her contorted angle, her chest was nearly
completely smooth
>I thought this was pretty neat
>I like those kinds of things
>But i figured i probably have to save blondie's ass instead of
stand there and enjoy the show
>So instead of running over and holding blondie's arms like some
kind of twisted girl tug-of-war
>I just walk over and scoop Glasses off her feet
>But she doesn't let go
>So now i'm holding Glasses, who is still trying to drag Blondie
off with her
>so its still tug of war but different
>I've got to be careful because moving glasses at all will
probably slam blondie into the baseboard of the bed and i really
don't want to do that.
>I decide my plan of action is to start tickling wherever i have
my hands on Glasses
>This was her ass, and her upper back
>Just where my hands ended up
>Actually perfect tickling locations
>She starts dying of laughter in my arms and lets go of blondie
>Blondie doesn't even hesitate, in half a second she's off the
ground, across the room and into the bathroom
>The lock clicks as she closes the door
>Poor girl, i don't think she was terrified as much as just
didn't want to be a part of this anymore

>I'm left holding a still giggling glasses
>I'd love to go along and pretend i'd said  "Who has been a
naughty girl and needs to be punished"
>Or something else ridiculously cliche like that.
>But unlike harem anime, you're not thinking this when you get
your happy warm closet time interrupted
>Nope, i was going to piledrive glasses into that bed like some
crazy sumo wrestler
>Not the hot kind of piledrive either
>I did have a problem though
>I didn't lift
>Girls are heavy
>With one knee i kinda use it to hoist her up in the air a bit
more than i was already holding her
>Well that's about as much height as i'm going to get
>Give her a kind of wiggling shove in the direction of the bed
>This isnt a piledrive at all
>She just wraps her arms around my neck and takes me down with
her
>We both end up on the bed

>This isn't romantic at all
>We're fighting
>Tickles, pinches,
>ow, ow
>Everything mean i did to her in the closet i get paid back like
seven times
>My hair is pulled
>I get my butt pinched, HARD
>Across the tussling i get kneed in the stomach a couple times
>This hurts

>The only good part is, i'm slowly winning
>I manage to pin her legs down and seat my crotch right on her
stomach so she can't kick me anymore
>My legs either side of her waist and pinning her thighs together
so she can't kick off the bed or something.
>Now its just an arm battle
>With the dexterity of ninjas we trade glancing blows
>The battle rages on for seven days and seven nights
>Right as i manage to block one arm she hits me with the other
>I pin her left arm down
>I pin her right arm down
>She bites me on the shoulder
>Fucking cheater

>I've finally got her pinned down completely
>I keep myself just far away enough from her snapping teeth to
not lose chunks of flesh
>I'm actually at a loss as to what to do now
>I realize i have a boner
>Its pressed into her stomach quite firmly
>It feels quite good actually
>she definitely notices
>I guess she's mine to ravage
>To the winner go the spoils
>I try to sneak in for a kiss
>She's still playing the snapping turtle game
>Its just not serious anymore i can see it in her eyes
>She's just being a tease
>You could almost tell her eyes were laughing

>I love laughing eyes
>I was glad, we were probably back to being friends again

>She stops snapping
>The look on her face changes to another smile, an almost
expectant one.
>Her eyelids fluttered in the most attractive way
>Everything was just screaming "Your move anon"
>She closes her eyes
>I close mine
>I lean in for the kiss

>Blondie's voice punctuates the silence through the bathroom door
with a very soft "Hey... you guys"
>Both of our eyes jolt open
>We're centimeters apart from a kiss
>Frozen, my lips hovering above hers.
>Blondie continues through the door: "I'm... going to take a
shower"
>Silence
>Still both of us staring into one another's eyes
>"Can one of you get my clothes"
>Fuck
>One of us has to respond
>Glasses does it "Sure thing, i'll go get em"
>Her chipper tone is extremely loud at how close we are.
>She's speaking directly into me, her voice almost projects
through my head
>I could swear i heard a faint ringing.
>Back to staring again though
>Frozen where we were
>Just silence until we hear the water start up in the bathroom

>Glasses takes the chance to lean up slightly and clack her teeth
together in a menacing snap right infront of my nose
>I mentally scream like a little girl
>I jump backwards a good half foot
>Lose grip on her arms
>She's got my arms now
>Oh no the war is lost
>Within the span of a second, i'm on my back, complete role
reversal
>She's got her crotch firmly planted on mine through, and she's
sitting far more upright
>She wiggles around to get a sense of how hard i am
>I can only assume i'm pressing right into her through however
many layers we have on.
>She bounces
>hnnggggg
>The pressure, amazing
>She bounces again
>Ohgoddontstop
>she stops
>Smiles at me
>Leans over and gives me a kiss on the cheek before getting up
off the bed entirely and walking away.
>There's just a small man somewhere inside of me at this point.
>Screaming

>I just lie there
>Hands and legs outstretched
>Just starfish right in the middle of the bed
>No willpower to get up
>Back to staring at the ceiling in the master bedroom i guess
>Just having ceiling kinda thoughts
>Hey look the same spots i was looking at earlier are here
>Why is the paint different colors than the walls?
>Is that a spider?
>You know, ceiling thoughts

>I'm learning the secret language of the spiders when i hear
footsteps return

>Lots of footsteps

>well maybe just two people

>I can't be assed enough to look

>these bitches be interrupting me and my spiderbros

>Atleast my spiderbros won't leave me with raging boners every 10
minutes

>A voice asks "How was your talk with blondie?"

>Raven

>I mumble something about hating all of them

>"Oh it can't be that bad!" raven exclaims while the bed takes
the obvious impact.

>Raven moves into my peripheral vision as she crawls over and
plops down beside me.

>I find myself accompanied in my quest to befriend the spiderbros

>She's lying down ontop of one of my arms, but she's not heavy so
its alright.

>Glasses mentions she's left the clothes by the bathroom door and
walks off

>I listen to her footsteps approach the bedroom door, and then
close it and walk off into the hallway

>is this some kind of fucking conspiracy
>glasses wont let me near blondie, but just happily locks me in a
room with raven
>i'm being plotted against
>can't trust anyone
>factions have formed behind my back and i'm not part of them.
>Raven inquires the content of my talk with blondie
>I'm done with the games
>i make it sound as unimportant as possible
>"I'm just covering up for some shit she did, don't mention it to
her its not that important"
>Thats met with a characteristic "Oh" from raven's mouth
>I still haven't moved
>Just not gonna move until my boner dies completely
>"You sure like staring at this ceiling" - Raven, observant as
always
>"I'm naming the spiders" - Me, blunt as always
>She starts helping
>In 10 minutes we've named every spot and spider on the ceiling
>Did i mention raven is a total bro

>Raven and I, having formed a new human/spider guild of
cooperation plan on using our new found spider army to rule the
world
>Lying there on a bed doing absolutely nothing but talking about
the ceiling
>This is a feeling all anons know and have experienced
>I have to remind you that first and foremost these were really
my good friends in this house
>I had grown up with raven from way before even middle school,
glasses, birthday and homely were just middle school school
friends and blondie was a new transfer this year but she was
/b/ro status all the same.
>Moments like these are just as good as everything else
>You just forget them when they're gone.
>Less sappy, and more world domination.
>We're not sure where to take over first though
>Various countries are ruled out as too cold for spiderbros
>We're contemplating south america
>But we're interrupted by a pretty loud shriek from the bathroom.
>Followed by bang and a crash.

>what sounds like the entire row of shampoo has levitated into
the air and flung itself across the bathroom from where we're
lying
>Various small objects ricocheting off the walls
>Sounds like a bomb went off
>the idea flashes across my mind that blondie could have somehow
mixed shampoo in the right formula to form an actual explosive
>This is probably an actually possible thing

>[spoiler]mixing shampoos is playing with your life
anons[/spoiler]
>It doesn't stay long, because in what can only be considered
superhuman speed, raven and I were both up and yelling "Blondie
,are you OK?" in unison.
>No response
>We're at the door banging and trying to get her to respond
>No response
>Raven is trying the doorknob frantically
>Blondie locked it

>Not sure what the best plan of action is here
>The house isn't exactly shit, so im pretty sure i couldn't break
down a door
>There was a tiny tiny window outside, not one we were going to
get in
>Blondie was probably hurt, or had her limbs spread out across
the bathroom due to the shampoo explosion.
>My mind was jumping to grim conclusions as always as you can see
>I grab the doorknob and just try to force it open past the lock
>Not gonna work
>I back up and decide i'm gonna try to be an anime hero and bash
the door down
>Igotthiscoach
>I take a running start
>Shoulder straight into the wood
>It doesn't give in the slightest

>IT REALLY HURTS THOUGH
>I give
>I crumple into a small pile at the bottom of the door
>The door has won

>My shoulder burns and throbs like i've just smashed it into a
hardwood door
>Oh wait

>That's a double oh-wait
>Because i definitely did smash it into a hardwood door
>But i also got a chance to look up and take a good look at the
doorknob
>My friend has these
>He showed me how to open them to fuck with his sister while she
was showering
>They've got a small hole right near the knob that if you put
something small into it unlocks
>Pervert memories to the rescue
>I get back up and rush over to the parent's makeup dresser
>Raven contributes by yelling through the door and trying to get
a response
>find a hairpin
>perfect
>I roughly shove raven out of the way and crouch down to find the
hole in the doorknob
>Right where i knew it was
>The door unlocks with a click  and we're both head over heels
scampering into the bathroom

>What we find is burned into my memory
>Every tile, every wisp of steam is there, all in one picture
>The master shower stall had the biggest assortment of shampoo
and conditioner bottles when i was in there last
>They were spread everywhere across the floor
>Razors, shaving cream, everything that was kept on the giant
shower shelf was on the floor
>The shower was still on, the water was almost falling in slow
motion
>I could even see the pattern of the water as it cascaded down
from the custom showerhead
>And right in the middle of it all
>was not a beautiful naked teenager that you should all be
popping boners for.
>It was my friend, motionless , and she looked very small and
insignificant in the middle of that shower stall

>We were at her side in seconds, kicking up shampoo bottles to
make room to sit beside her
>No Cuts
>Check
>Breathing
>Check
>Any funny twisted limbs
>Nope
>We both went over the checklist of everything we could in those
couple of split seconds
>But to us blondie was still lying motionless on the shower floor
>She didn't even have her eyes open
>I don't know if you've ever been in a situation like that
>At that age, we had no experience whatsoever in appropriate
procedures
>We were more clueless than anything else up to this point
>and i don't know about raven, but i was scared shitless

>Raven guesses at what to do and starts shaking blondie softly
>Its almost sickening to watch her limp body shake
>I don't even know how to describe how fear makes everything
terrible, but ii was almost sick to my stomach every time
blondie's head rolled a little bit because her body was moved.
>I just grab one of blondie's hands and squeeze it tightly,
hoping she'll wake up
>Its a tense couple of seconds before she shows a bit of movement
>the second she does, raven and i both start breathing again
>I didn't even realize i was holding my breath

>She's not dead
>I realize she might have hit her head pretty hard, so i lift her
up gently and look to make sure there's no blood or anything
>I run my hand under her head and besides lots of wet hair, i
don't find any large bumps
>Doctor anon prognosis, she'll live
>I'm left holding a very dazed and confused naked girl in my arms
>[spoiler]yeah, she's not dying or dead so she's back to being
attractive[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]dont say a word[/spoiler]

>She's not crying or anything
>I look at raven and realize she's crying though
>Actually that's quite a bit of tears
>I look down at my lap and realize i'm crying too
>Oh, no its just raining

>Look up and see we're sitting happily right under the showerhead
>We're both soaking wet
>Wasn't even on our list of things that needed to be noticed
until that point
>I find it funny, but its not time for laughter so i just hold it
in
>Raven scoots closer and kind of envelops blondie and myself in a
hug
>Warm
>Wet
>Nothing quite like holding one naked girl in your arms and
getting hugged by another in the shower.

>I hope blondie is feeling the maximum comfy upon waking up from
her temporary coma
>I'm still not really in a place to be popping boners though
>I'm confused as to how blondie managed to take the entire shower
stall down with her
>I ask her this with a "What happened>?"
>No response from blondie, she seems to be unwilling to cooperate
with answers
>Probably because of all the chinese water torture we're forcing
upon her.
>Drip
>Drip
>Water is running down my head and off my nose and hitting her on
the cheek
>Its just gotta do with the angle my head is at, but it's just a
small detail i'm noticing as i pry into her face for answers.
>She still says nothing
>She points up at the corner, about waist height

>Raven gets up to investigate
>I take the chance to do a once over of blondie's body since
raven was no longer blocking my line of sight.
>[spoiler] was actually like four times[/spoiler]
>Not a pound of fat on her ,just wet and smooth all the way down
>Well until "All" the way down, then she's a natural blonde
>Good to know
>I get an odd sound from raven, kinda an embarrassed hiccup
>I think she's caught me looking so i drop my eyes and do a
tactical roll out of there
>but i'm pinned down by blondie so i don't really go anywhere
>i look up at raven and she's examining something in the corner
>She swipes her hand across the tile and comes over and holds her
hand in front of me
>Its sticky and shiny with a white substance
>Oh
>Oops
