 style="font-weight: bold;">08 - LISA'S PRISON <span
 style="font-family: creepy;">FLOGGING</span></span></font><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"What's all
this, Sammy?" asked Lisa.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">The girls
had just got back to their shared cell - their second night there after
being moved out of the dormitory - after a hard day at work, in the
course of which Lisa had found herself challenging a new prisoner&nbsp;
to a fist fight, which Hatchet-Face had agreed to. She still smarted
from the grazes her unprotected body had suffered as it had slid on the
sharp gravel and wanted nothing more than to rest. But Samantha had
other ideas for Lisa. Where had she got that rope from? She surely
wasn't thinking of escaping with less than a year now to serve?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"It's a
skipping rope, Lisa. Go and work out in the corridor! There's bags of
room and you need to work on those legs and it's good for
co-ordination. GO ON, Lisa! You want to win against that cow, don't
you?"</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Lisa obeyed
and was soon dripping sweat and attracting an admiring audience as she
kept up a skipping rhythm until they were all ordered into their cells
to be locked in for the night.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Now do I
get some rest?" she asked her self-appointed trainer.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Push-ups!
One hundred. Then a hundred sit-ups. I'll hold your feet for you. Even
if they are dirty and smelly!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Samantha
counted up to one hundred as Lisa did her push-ups and then leapt off
her bunk and held her feet until she finished the second exercise. By
this time Lisa's body smell filled the entire area of their not too
large cell.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Is that
all?" panted an exhausted Lisa. "Can we go to bed now?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Yes. But
not together! You're in training now and sex is bad for you!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Maybe, but
I won't be fighting all the time between now and August!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Yes you
will!&nbsp; So we'll have to wait until we get that lovely country
cottage!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"We'll
probably have found ourselves a couple of men by then, Sammy! Never
mind, it's just so lovely being this close to you."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Isn't it,
though! You smell gorgeous, Lisa, my darling sweaty friend. Absolutely
wonderful!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">In the
morning the sound of a bell wakened them and they started a new day.
Lisa shaved her head carefully (she wasn't in love with that cane,
still less with the kinky Hatchet-Face) and Samantha checked it for
her, running her hand over every square millimetre.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"You missed
a bit, darling. Give me the razor and I'll soon zap those naughty
blonde bristles and save those adorable buttocks from another
thrashing! I bet you're glad you're not a man! Fancy having to do this
for the rest of your life and not just a few months!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"A man only
shaves his face as a rule. And I think it might be great!&nbsp; If I
were one, the first thing I'd do would be ask you to marry me!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"And I'd
accept! And we'd better hurry or we'll be late on parade. We'll be
marching on all that nice new fresh gravel we laid yesterday! Your poor
feet!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Samantha
giggled at this. She had a great love for Lisa but absolutely no
sympathy for the discomforts her nakedness and continuing punishments
brought her. Lisa wondered about this at times, but she wouldn't have
her friend any other way than she was. The morning drill session
following the inspection, in which Lisa's shiny skulled perfection
brought her a rare word of praise, was as tough on Lisa's feet as
Samantha had laughingly predicted. They were marched up and down and
then double-marched around the parade ground until some of the older
women dropped from exhaustion. The barefoot prisoners were all fine at
the end, except for Lisa who limped beside Samantha to their assignment
for the day. Lisa was not anxious to walk too quickly but a prod in the
back from a rifle butt soon livened her up, eliciting yet more giggles
from Samantha.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Come on,
slowcoach. We haven't all day!&nbsp; We need the points. At least I do!
So hurry up and don't be such a baby! Just forget about those silly
feet and think what a lovely day it is!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"It's a
horrible day. I thought it was warm all the year round in this country!
It's nearly as cold as it was in the hole. It is good to be outside,
though. I just wish we could get a bit of sun. I want to get broken in
to it gradually before it gets too strong. This bloody cloud is not
helping at all."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"It never
shines till March and after that it burns like Hell. You WILL suffer
Lisa. But I'll be there to soothe your poor old body at night.
Seriously, I hope they give you some sun cream. You'll be really ill
for a while if they don't."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"I'll be
ill. I can't see them making life easy for me. That's not the point of
stripping me, Sammy."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"When you go
home will you always wear clothes, darling? I think it would be a
shame! Grow your hair, though, but not too long. I like you to have
nice short cropped hair" But be naked a lot, all round the house and in
the garden and anywhere you can get away with it!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"I don't
know. It gets terribly cold in the winter, so I will be dressed then -
outside at least. I thought when I started my punishment that nakedness
depersonalised me, but I still feel like a human being and just as good
a one as I ever did - better in fact - and I don't need clothes for
anything other than warmth. So the answer is that I will continue to
provide my exposed body for you to admire just as long as I don't
freeze and sometimes even if I do!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"I'm looking
forward to seeing your home and settling into our special one together.
I met your father. I wonder what he'll think of you living with a girl!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Don't worry
about him! He does as he's told! And anyway he's too polite where our
sex is concerned. He puts women on a pedestal. Like he did with me,
which in a way wasn't good for me, but if he hadn't I'd never have met
you! So it's all for the best, darling Sammy!" </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Today's task
involved removing the turf from the sports field and replacing it with
an artificial covering. Lisa doubted very much that this would be
complete much before her release, if at all before. After the grass had
been removed by dint of spadework, the field would be levelled with
heavy rollers, all pushed by prisoners. Finally the artificial turf
would be laid. Why the authorities should be wasting time and money on
such a pointless exercise, Samantha and Lisa were unable to fathom.
This first day of the enterprise saw four women engaged on stage one.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Lisa and
Samantha were working together, Samantha trying to give Lisa all the
really heavy work to build her up for the fight, whenever it might be.
But it was pretty heavy work for both, especially as it was raining
again, and the whole field was like one large bog. Lisa looked down at
her legs and feet and wondered despairingly how she was ever going to
present spotlessly clean toes and soles to the eagle-eyed inspecting
officer next day! It was this aspect of the inspection that gave her
most cause to fear. Whereas failure to shave her head properly got her
six strokes, there was no upper limit where feet were concerned. Three
days ago, one of the ex-solitary women, a forty year old had been bent
over the trestle to receive an eye-wateringly vicious twenty. Lisa felt
sorrier for the older woman's loss of dignity that anything else.
Whopping a twenty year old like her seemed less offensive, somehow. She
did not seek to query such crazy logicality, but knew that she must
look after feet with great zeal!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">One of the
other toilers in this muddy waste was Prisoner 10343, as her soon-to-be
opponent was known. Lisa called her Queen Kong, which was a bit of an
exaggeration, but did emphasise that she was bigger and far uglier that
Lisa. Smashing that face in might actually improve its appearance, Lisa
thought as she stole the odd searching glance, trying to size up the
problem she was going to have in a few days. Judging from the way she
was loading up the cut turfs onto the barrows, she was pretty strong,
but Lisa noticed a certain breathlessness about her after she had been
working for twenty minutes. She wasn't in such good condition as Lisa,
who would be skipping tonight and every night until the sweat poured
off her and made puddles on the floor! She saw that if she could only
survive for a half dozen rounds, she would still be fresh and this
woman would be tiring rapidly. She grinned as she saw Hatchet-Face give
her a rifle butt in her back to encourage her to keep up her work rate
which was visibly slowing. She redoubled her own efforts and soon sweat
was mingling with rain as she showed 10343 and the watching guards just
how good aand tireless a worker she was.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Hatchet -
Face came up to her and watched her slaving away for a few minutes.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Happy
little thing today, aren't we! I saw you sizing up the opposition! Give
the cow the lesson of her life, Lisa. Knock her so hard she meets
herself coming back!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"I'll do
just that, Ma'am! Oh, Ma'am?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Yes?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Would you
be my second, Ma'am? Sammy thinks you'd be better at it that she would.
I'd account it an honour, Ma'am!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"I'd be
proud to, Lisa. Now get on with it. I've seen what you can do, so keep
it up. Got that, Lisa? Don't you dare slow up or I'll find a way of
caning that arse till your eyes water!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Lisa
wondered, after this exchange, if it was such a good idea to enlist
Rosanne as a second. What with her and Samantha between them she wasn't
to get much rest in the days to come! Correction! She wasn&#8217;t going to
get any. But she kept up her work rate all day and then got marched
back to a long hot shower, evening meal and more bloody skipping
followed by one hundred and fifty push ups and the same number of
sit-ups.</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"You must
like the smell of my sweat, darling!" she said wearily as she got into
bed.</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"It's just
heavenly, Lisa. Just heavenly. You'll sweat even more tomorrow!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">But Lisa was
dead to the world long before her task-mistress had finished talking!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">****************************************************</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Big day for
you tomorrow, Lisa!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Nice of you
to remind me!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Tomorrow was
to be Lisa's first public flogging. She would be told this evening
after supper how many times that strap would descend on to her ever
naked back on this occasion. She wondered how they determined the
number. Was it a random selection of a number between twenty and sixty
or had her conduct over the weeks since her release got something to do
with it? If it was the latter, then her only failure had been not
shaving her head properly one morning and she had been punished for
that. And there had been the passage of words with Rosanne which had
cost her eighteen strokes. But she had worked well and knew full well
that her output was way ahead of most other women here, with the
possible exception of Samantha. So why was she so frightened and why
was Samantha so sure she was going to get the full works? She would
know the worst tonight and then have to sleep on it. Fortunately Lisa
was so tired these days that she could sleep through anything!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">It was one
of those rare days when work was going so well that Sammy and Lisa were
given a short break mid-morning.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"You seem to
think I'll get the max tomorrow, Sammy. Why?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Samantha
grinned. "It's your whole attitude, Lisa. I know you work hard and are
doing your best to put on a great show against that ugly cow whenever
the fight happens to be. And you always call the screws Ma'am. But you
aren't humble with it, Lisa. You forget you're a convicted criminal. I
know you didn't do it, and so do they by this time, but they can't take
any notice of that. You are here to be punished. Not only punished for
your original offence but for getting sent four times to solitary. By
the time you leave they are determined to beat that pride of yours well
and truly out of you. And you are just as determined not to crawl on
your belly. So sixty it is, both tomorrow and every other first of the
month! 'Cause you won't knuckle under. Even if you wanted to, you just
don't know how and I love you for it and they respect you for it, but
they'll make it bloody tough for you all the same!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"I guess
you're right, Sam! I do obey all the orders they give me. I keep myself
clean and my head shaved (with a bit of help from you). But I can't
feel inferior to these guards because I know I'm not. I respect
Rosanne, because she's good at her job and keeps her lust for my body
under control - thank goodness! And I've come to respect the governor
in a&nbsp; way because he's a decent man working for a bad system. But
you're right. I'll just have to accept it's going to be a hard eight
months. But with you with me it won't matter."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Samantha
looked serious. "Lisa! About me helping you shave. I won't do it any
more. I love helping you, darling Lisa, but you've got to do it
yourself. If they knew I was helping it wouldn't look good - not for
you and not for me either. Sorry!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Don't be
sorry, Sammy! You're quite right. A few canings and I'll soon perfect
the art of having a nice shiny head every morning! Starting tomorrow,
then!"</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">By the end
of the day, the field was looking like the site of a major battle. Most
of the turf had been removed by now but Lisa could see that the
uncoordinated effort was getting exactly nowhere. The guards were doing
no more than watch the toiling prisoners like hawks and the only one of
them who seemed to share Lisa's exasperation was Hatchet-Face.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"We need a
proper foreman to organise this lot! It's a shambles!" she said as
Rosanne passed.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Did I hear
you say Ma'am?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Sorry,
Ma'am. But this field's about as level as the Himalayas and not getting
any better!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"You are
right, Lisa. It's getting worse by the second. I'm putting you in
charge as from tomorrow. Straight after your flogging you come and sort
this bunch of wankers out!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">With that
unwanted reminder of the coming public humiliation, she left Lisa to
carry on working.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">*******************************</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Where did
you get this from, Sammy?" said Lisa, looking at the punch bag hanging
in the corridor outside their cell.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Your second
got hold of it. We saved it up as a surprise. She says you've got to
practice kicking and punching and if you break a bone in your foot
she'll personally kill you with her bare hands - if I haven't got there
first! hat are you waiting for, Lisa. Get stuck in. The fight could be
only days away!."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Lisa had
been practising for an hour when Rosanne turned up, told her she was
doing it all wrong and&nbsp; sorted out a few problems of technique. By
the time she had put Lisa through her paces both of them were
perspiring. As she turned to go, she handed Lisa an envelope.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"That
contains your instructions for tomorrow. I'd turn in now if I were you.
You've a long and very painful day ahead of you! First the flogging and
then getting that awkward squad working together. I think you'll find
the flogging by far the easier challenge. Goodnight Lisa."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Lisa opened
the envelope and took out the single sheet of paper. She read it and
Samantha could see her face go pale as death. Her hands shook and she
silently handed it to her best friend.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">Samantha
read it and handed it back.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Poor old
Lisa. I never thought it would be that bad. But this time tomorrow it
will all be over. So cheer up and get some rest. As Hatchet-Face said.
Boy! Are you going to need it!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">The
instructions were as follows.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">

Griffiths, convicted thief and former solitary inmate still under
punishment - You will receive your first formal public flogging at six
tomorrow morning, the First day of January. You must be ready to be
given a full inspection by the Inspecting Officer at four thirty. This
will be a particularly thorough inspection and any failure to be in
impeccable condition will be severely punished by thirty strokes of a
rattan cane on your buttocks in addition to the six strokes, if
appropriate, relating to unsatisfactory head shaving. On completion of
the inspection and any necessary physical chastisement you will be
taken to the reception area in the Solitary Confinement Block and be
prepared for your flogging. This preparation will consist of your hands
being manacled behind your back and both ankles being manacled, the
foot manacles being attached to a three foot long chain.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">All
prisoners will be lined up to witness your punishment and you will be
paraded in your chains past each and every one of them, your head bowed
and your eyes looking at the ground.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">You
will receive the maximum number of sixty strokes of a heavy leather
strap. The flogging will be performed by three of your fellow inmates,
all of whom have been given the strictest instructions to show you no
mercy.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black; font-style: italic;">Both
before and after the flogging you will thank each of your floggers in a
loud and clear voice, kneeling in front of each as you do so. Failure
to obey will result in your immediate return to solitary confinement on
reduced rations for the remainder of your sentence. After your flogging
you will return to duty and have no meals until supper."</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"You won't
be silly, Lisa, will you? Please, Lisa!&nbsp; Just grin and bear it.
Don't get sent down there again!" Samantha was almost in tears.</span><br

<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial black;">"Don't fret
my love. As you say - this time tomorrow it will all be over and we
will be together again!"</span><br
