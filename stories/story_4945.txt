CHAPTER FIVE

GAY INTERLUDE

One thing none of us had been ready for  except, maybe, 
Danny  was gay-relationship. Nogah and I had still been 
SEVERELY scarred, from our harsh, traumatic experiences 
at the concentration-camps; `Idith, being so religious 
and all  eventhough, at the time of those events, 
she had already foresaken much of her faith  of course, 
could not have even consider the very possibility. But, 
still  something happened, which was right about 
to change all this  and change for The Very Best.

It was about three weeks after our first Orgy took place, 
AT THE SHADOW OF THE CITRUS-TREES, and Nogah had already 
entered her 5th Month of Pregnancy. Her tits had 
grown dramaticly and all of us had yearned for the day, 
she shall have milk and we'll be able to really celebrate. 
Don't get me wrong, we LOVE Orange-Juice, <>-Tea 
and so on, don't get me wrong; but  as ever since 
`Idith and Daniel had joined us, the only meat we had 
caught and cooked, had been birds' (as we had decided 
to wait a little bit longer, before dropping the bomb 
of us being happy canibals upon our LifeMates Lovely, 
yet so Incredibly Naive heads)  we sure did miss, 
drinking Mother's Milk!! From time to time, Danny and I 
would have left the Girls back Home, under our Sacred Trees 
 as all of us insisted, that now, Nogah was NOT to risk 
her dearest Pregnancy  sneak into enemy-territory and 
take away some grocery-stuff, including milk, meat, 
fish etc.; but it was not the same, of course, as 
milking a Woman's  a Young Mommy's  tit and drinking 
directly from it; You can take my word for it, it wasn't.

But, that day, when we boys had ventured out  something 
happened: a young, pregnant woman, saw us  and was 
so incredibly and straight-down STUPID, as to trying, 
to stop us and yelling for the police.

So  Danny, had not had any real experience yet, 
in dealing with hostile parties of THIS kind; but, me, 
for the other hand  o-ho!! I hade wasted no time, 
in knocking her dead, stuffing her, into the 
luggage-department of our sports car  just like 
in some Mafia-film  and driving off.

As it happened, it was better than any of us could ever 
have hoped for: as she was well into her 8 Month  
and lactating WELL.

And, while driving back  I had stopped the car, 
in a hidden spot I've known from before, turned to Danny  
and told him about the Canibalism-part, of our Life style. 
Not about the babies yet; no, I had let him understand, 
we had done it ONLY to people, who had threatened us 
with the inconceivable danger of exposure.

Even so, he had been as white as the cleanest, 
newly-painted office-wall.

He had almost fainted.

And, after I had revived him  his only request was: 
"Dont You EVER tell `Idith about it!! She'll pass out 
and NEVER get up again!!" Lord, was he frightened.

I had calmed him, saying that I Love `Idith, 
just as much as I Love my Sister  which has been 
ABSOLUTLY CORRECT AND EXACT, SIMILARILY THEN AND NOW 
 and that he can rest asure  she shall NEVER know 
anything, she wouldn't be ready for. "She shall NEVER be 
ready for for THIS" utter my FOREVER-Closest 
(masculin) Friend in the Universe, tears of fear 
coming to his eyes

And what came next was just  I don't know, natural:

I had leaned to him, held him closed, he rose 
his tear-flushed face towards mine  and 

We kissed.

And this was The Sweetest, Warmest, Kindest, RIGHTEST Kiss 
Of My Entire LIFE  better than Nogah's. Better than 
`Idith's. Better than ANY, EVER!!!!

Because it was Gay.

Rightfully Gay. Not  as I had known gay-relationships 
before  forced, violent, evil; it had been anything 
BUT all of that. It had been Loving, Pure; I had never 
felt anything, which had been Warmer, TRUER, more pretty 
and sincere. You can ask us all You want, how long 
did it last  neither one of us could tell, whether it was 
short or long, just a few seconds or half an hour  
it was just this: THE most Beautiful Experience, 
which any of us has ever had, before OR since.

Our Kiss had finally ended. "I Love You we told each other 
simultaneously, and smiled. I hugged him tight. 
"Don't worry", I promised him, "`Idith shall be ready, 
one day. And before that, she shall not hear a single word 
about it, from any of us, EVER".

And after this was done, I'd restarted the engine and 
we'd gone Home.

And back Home, in the meantime But no, You shall have 
to wait for the next Chapter, in order to know that!!
