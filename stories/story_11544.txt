From the pen of Bertram W. Wooster: In which there are consequences.

Chapter 9: ...And Punishment

I awoke on a bed much harder and narrower than I was accustomed. Rolling over to seek out a clock, I found myself face to spine with a pile of books on the nightstand. Pygmalion was sandwiched between some volume titled Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione and Prufrock and Other Observations. Hiding on the bottom, as if ashamed of itself, was a copy of Rosie M. Banks's latest romance. I took a few moments to put two and two together, but when I added up to four, so to speak, a wave of euphoria swept over me. Clearly, this was Jeeves's room, and those were Jeeves's books, for who else of my acquaintance would read something with so ponderous a name as Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione.

If this was Jeeves's room, my thoughts progressed, I must be in Jeeves's bed, and if I was in Jeeves's bed, then that must mean that the actions of last night were not the product of my unconscious teasing me with vivid, wishful dreams. The only dark spot on this otherwise boomps-a-daisy morning was the lack of Jeeves himself in the room. No sooner did I have the thought than Jeeves entered with a breakfast tray balanced on his hand.

"That is remarkable, Jeeves!"

"Sir?"

"The way you seem to know exactly what I want the very instant I think it."

"I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir."

His words recalled the night before; he seemed to be able to read my mind then, too. My cheeks warmed at the thought. Jeeves must have divined the source of my blush, for he smirked most wickedly as he laid the tray upon my lap. I dug into my eggs and b. with enthusiasm. "How long have you been up?"

"Roughly three hours. The late night caused me to sleep through more of the morning than is my usual habit."

"Three hours! That's practically the crack of dawn!"

"In point of fact, sir, at this time of year, sunrise is at approximately quarter after five."

"Well, eight in the ack emma seems like the crack of dawn to me. I don't suppose you could sleep longer in the future? It would be dashed pleasant to wake up next to you."

"I'm afraid it is quite impossible, sir."

"Oh. Well, I suppose I could wake up earlier, then." The offer was sincere, although I shuddered at the horror of it. There are some hours of the day that man was simply not meant to see, but I would do it if Jeeves wanted it, no matter how torturous it would be.

"If that is what you desire. Otherwise, I see no reason why we cannot continue in our accustomed schedules. They seemed to work well for us in the past."

"You have a point," I said. "I don't suppose we could sleep in my bed next time, though. There's a good deal more room. There were times last night that I thought that I'd fall right off if you weren't holding on to me."

"That would be agreeable," Jeeves answered. "What suit shall I lay out for you, sir?"

I frowned in thought. "Do I have anything on the schedule aside from helping to outsmart the nefarious villain who kidnapped me?"

"Lady Worplesdon is expecting you for lunch at one."

"Aunt Agatha?" My mood dropped like a U-boat. "Can't we tell her I was kidnapped? Surely an experience like that is enough to get a reprieve from all fire-breathing aunts for at least a week."

"She enquired into your whereabouts while you were missing. I told her that you were surveying lots with a contractor, and then paying a visit to Brinkley Court. It seemed the wisest course of action."

"Surveying lots? Why would I be surveying lots?"

Jeeves filled me in on the whole deception--namely that I was intending to build a home for my soon-to-be wife and children. I felt a thread of panic just thinking about the thing.

"What am I going to tell Aunt Agatha?" I asked. "She thinks I'm going to be proposing to some girl any day now."

"Tell her that you proposed this morning and were rebuffed. It would help if you were to intimate that the young lady in question were a waitress or perhaps a chorus girl."

"I see what you're getting at. She'll be so relieved that I'm not getting hooked to some waitress that she'll be glad that my proposal was a bum deal."

"Exactly."

"Jeeves, you're brilliant."

"Thank you, sir."

I took a sip of joyful tea. My relaxing breakfast was interrupted, however, by the sound of some sort of banging emanating from the sitting room. I had no idea what could be causing the noise, but since Jeeves was here and I was here, I had some idea of whom. "I take it our guests are up and about?"

A lesser man would have rolled his eyes, but Jeeves expressed his dismay in a much more subtle fashion, with a mere lowering of his eyelids and twitch of his mouth. "Mr. Holmes has been awake for some hours now."

"Oh dear."

"Indeed, sir."

"Some people just don't know when to settle down, smell the roses, take it slow."

Jeeves expression brightened. "He has, however, been useful in clearing out some space in your wardrobe."

"What?" I said with alarm.

"This morning he approached me with a request for any cast-off clothes we could spare. He explained that he intended to carry out some undercover reconnaissance and needed clothing with which to construct a few disguises. I told him that I would be happy to accommodate him."

My alarm grew to a panic and sprouted wings, ready to fly into complete horror. I pushed the breakfast tray aside, leapt from the bed, hurriedly put on my pyjamas, and rushed to the sitting room, hardly noticing or caring how it would look to have a pyjama-ed Wooster emerging from Jeeves's bedroom.

Holmes was there, as expected, doing unspeakably cruel things to my cobalt blue trilby. Already it looked as though it had been trampled by horses, washed in a mud puddle, and used as a flowerpot. Now, as if the poor thing hadn't suffered enough, Holmes was subjecting it to a violent beating with my cane. My shoulders slumped. I was too late to save it; my hat was doomed.

I crossed the sitting room, meandering widely around Holmes to avoid suffering the same sort of beating that he was inflicting on the trilby, and entered my bedroom, anxious to see what clothes Jeeves and Holmes had seen fit to leave me. The damage was not as bad as I'd feared, though it was certainly bad enough. Gone were my cheerful yellow and green tie, my apricot-coloured shirt, and brass-buttoned jacket.

Jeeves drifted in. "I think the grey pinstripe would be an excellent choice for today, sir."

Well, after seeing all my favourite clothes torn apart in so a treacherous a manner, I was not about to give in to Jeeves's every sartorial whim. "No. I'm going to wear the navy. And don't even think of trying to dissuade me. I know that it's difficult, for we are both men of strong will and do not like to let go of things easily--"

There was a snort of derision from the doorway. I turned to see Holmes leaning on the doorframe. "Mr. Wooster, you've many admirable qualities, I'm sure, but you've about as much strength of will as a jelly." With that astonishing statement he turned to Jeeves and said, "I need a hat brush and a bit of beeswax," and left again as quickly as he'd come. Jeeves closed the door to prevent any more interruptions.

My mouth opened and shut many times before I could get any words out. "Why, of all the...Jeeves! You don't agree with him, do you?"

"It is not my place to say, sir."

"Dash it all, of course it's your place to say! You're not just my valet now. In truth, you haven't been for a long time, long before last night."

"I think the navy would be a splendid choice, sir."

Now I thought he was just humouring me, and I wouldn't have that. "I've changed my mind. I want to wear the grey pinstripe."

"Very good, sir."

Jeeves laid out the grey pinstripe suit while I stepped out of my pyjamas, feeling quite smug about having won that argument and proving to myself and to Jeeves that no matter how much I loved him, I was still my own man.

By the time I'd dressed and emerged from my room, Holmes was finished with his brutal assault on my hat and now appeared engaged in the nigh impossible task of setting it back to rights. Dr. Watson had joined him in the sitting room. Jeeves glided over to where Watson sat.

"Would you like some tea and breakfast, sir?"

Watson replied, "Breakfast would be splendid, but no tea, please." He met Holmes's eyes and raised his voice. "I've had quite enough of tea for a while."

Jeeves raised an eyebrow one eighth of an inch and biffed off to the kitchen. I was left feeling like I'd missed something, like someone forgot to give Bertram the secret code, which would unlock the meaning of the conversation. "I hardly thought it was possible to have too much tea. Well, I suppose one could." I chuckled as a memory drifted up to the forefront of my mind. "Biffy--he's one of my chums at the Drones Club--once drank ten cups of strong tea in immediate succession on a dare. He was miserable for a few hours and shaking like a leaf, but had forgotten clean about it by the next day. Of course, Biffy can't remember his own name one day to the next, so that's really not surprising. But as for just getting tired of tea, I for one have never heard of it. No one to my knowledge has ever said, 'Blast it, tea with breakfast again? I won't stand for it anymore.' Well, not until now, at least."

Watson coughed. "It's not exactly like that."

"Watson is making a needlessly dramatic gesture to express his feelings on a certain private matter," Holmes explained acerbically.

"Oh," I said, and left it at that. If they were going to be at odds again, then I would stay well out of it.

There was a long and awkward silence, broken only by the sound of Holmes tearing a small rip in the seam out of one of the sleeves of my brass-buttoned jacket. More to fill the silence than curiosity, I asked, "So, what sort of disguise are you making?"

"A man with little money, but pretensions of grandeur, and poor taste. Just the sort of person who lingers in the places Roberson frequents." Holmes continued, "The fine quality of clothes indicate the pretensions of wealth, but the clothes will have the appearance of being used cast-offs, a bit tatty, and not tailored to his form. Thus, he has little money himself but would like people to think that he does. The lack of taste--"

Watson interrupted before Holmes could finish, "Do you get the newspaper, Mr Wooster? I wouldn't mind catching up on what's happened in the world these past few days."

I was grateful for the change of subject, for I had the rummy feeling that I wouldn't have liked where the prior conversation was going. "Jeeves always brings in the paper with my breakfast tray. If you'll hang on just a tick, I'll go get it." I instinctively marched towards my room before I remembered that I'd abandoned my breakfast in Jeeves's room, and he'd probably already cleared it away. I about-faced and popped into the kitchen to ask Jeeves about the paper's whereabouts. He directed me to my breakfast tray, which was sitting on the kitchen table. I expressed my thanks, snatched up the paper, and wandered back to the sitting room, skimming over the headlines as I entered. One in particular caught my eye.

"Oh, look! You're in the paper, see?" I pointed to the headline SCOTLAND YARD INVESTIGATES THEFT OF PRICELESS ANTIQUITIES.

Just as I was about to start reading, Holmes leapt up and snatched the paper from my hands. He surveyed the front page before handing the paper over to Watson. "If you please, my dear Watson."

Watson cleared his throat, and then recited:

Yesterday morning a break-in was discovered at the house of Sir Ronald de Glanville in Highgate. A thorough search of the house was conducted, during the course of which it was found that the burglars had absconded with the famous Jewels of Tarpeia, estimated to be worth over twenty thousand pounds. No other valuables were missing from the house.

Lady Elizabeth de Glanville's grandfather, the noted explorer and archaeologist Sir Arthur Grainger, discovered The Jewels of Tarpeia in the Tuscany region of Italy in 1847.

Watson interrupted his narrative, "It then goes on to talk about the history of the jewels, and a bit of nonsense about a curse��""

"A curse?" I said, with some apprehension. I'd not touched the jewels myself, but they'd been brought into my home and used to ransom my person. I might very well fall into the sphere of their malevolent influence.

"It's nothing much; merely that all those who touch the jewels will either commit a grave betrayal or have one committed upon them. Then it gives some lurid details of romantic affairs as evidence. Ah, here we are, back to the investigation." He continued.

The investigation is being carried out by Detective Inspector James Cinwell of Scotland Yard, who recently received much acclaim for his sharp deductions and swift action in the Streatham murders case. "It was a clean job," the Inspector revealed during yesterday's interview. "Either a seasoned professional, or someone who has a great deal of knowledge of crime and the criminal method at his disposal." When asked if he had any leads on a suspect, the Inspector replied, "I'm not at liberty to give out names at this time."

"Then it concludes with a summary of some of Inspector Cinwell's successes," Watson finished. "Well, Holmes, what do you think? Are we in any danger from this Inspector Cinwell?"

Holmes shook his head. "I shouldn't think so. His record��"what little I know of it��"is erratic, sometimes brilliant, at other times amazingly inept. This particular crime is remarkably commonplace, no different from the actions of any other contemptible sneak-thief," he said bitingly. "We left no fingerprints to trace, no marks, save our footsteps in the grass outside the window. Even if he notices those��"and given the observational skills of the average Scotland Yard detective he may very well not��"he could hardly investigate the shoes of seven million Londoners, hoping he will find a match."

"Yes, I suppose you're right. Still, that phrase, what was it? 'A great deal of knowledge of crime and the criminal method.' It gives me chills."

"It's a very basic bit of deduction. The crime was well done, ergo, the criminal had either experience or knowledge. Granted, it is remarkable to see anything resembling deductive reasoning from the official police, but even they can't be entirely hopeless all the time."

I cleared my throat in what I'd intended to be an elegant, Jeeves-like manner, but instead of sounding like the subtle cough of a grazing thoroughbred, it came out more like the wheeze of an asthmatic pony. Clearly, it was an acquired skill. All the same, it had the desired effect of breaking up the conversation so that I could speak.

"Investigations and such aside, is there anything on the table today? That is to say, will my indispensable services be needed for the next few hours? Jeeves tells me I've got an appointment with the dreaded Aunt Agatha, and I've a mind to stop by my club to get myself a fortifying drink and give the lads there a 'What ho.'"

"Yes, yes," Holmes gave a dismissive wave. "Remember, however, not to say a word to anyone about me or Roberson or anything that has happened."

"Right ho. Jeeves has already given me the whole ala...ali...dash it all, Jeeves, what's the word? Something Latin, means you're in one place instead of another."

"Alibi, sir."

"Yes, that's the one. Alibi. Jeeves has already given me the alibi of the viewing of lots and the failed marriage proposal. I have everything well in hand."

With my good-byes said, Jeeves handed me my stick and hat--a staid grey fedora since my cheerful, cobalt blue trilby had been so recklessly commandeered--and off I went. It was a short and agreeable walk to the Drones Club. A mild breeze blew, sending puffy white clouds scattering over the sun, rendering the world bright and warm one minute and tenebrous the next.

The club was loud and boisterous as usual, and for a moment it seemed difficult to believe that so much could have happened in my life these past few days, that so much could change and yet the Drones could remain exactly the same as ever. I ducked to avoid being conked in the head with a dinner roll and made my way to the bar where I saw a familiar form sitting.

"Tuppy, old chap, long time no see." I sat down beside him.

"Bertie! Where have you been, old bean!"

Tuppy knew me too well to ever believe that I intended to marry a chorus girl, so I went for the second half of Jeeves's fib. "Oh, here and there. I visited Brinkley Court. Aunt Dahlia had a problem come up that could only be solved through the wits and wisdom of yours truly."

"No you didn't."

"Didn't I?"

"No. I received a telegram from your cousin Angela not three hours ago telling me how frightfully boring it's been these past few days."

"Well, I didn't say the problem was an exciting one." Inspiration struck. "In fact, once I arrived and set my mind to work, the whole thing cleared up in no time. Angela probably never even noticed that there was a problem, thanks to my quick thinking."

"You mean Jeeves's quick thinking, I'm sure."

It went without saying that Jeeves went with me on this fictitious journey. "Jeeves may have offered a crumb or two of advice."

"A crumb. More like a whole cake."

"A slice," I countered. "But it was Bertram Wooster who carried out the deed."

I summoned the bar tender. Although few things were more deserving of a fortifying drink than an incipient meeting with Aunt Agatha, who was the very worst sort of aunt, the sort who, while gnashing teeth and breathing fire, would harangue long and wide about one's manner, lifestyle, and overall comportment, I decided against it. If the aged relative caught one whiff of alcohol on the breath, I'd really be in for it and with Aunt Agatha that was saying something. So it was with regret that chose to imbibe nothing stronger than a glass of orange juice, as if I were Gussie Fink-Nottle, the most hopeless poop of my acquaintance.

Tuppy meanwhile grumbled on for a bit about Angela, working himself into a passion about the breezy tone of her telegram. "It's like she could take me or leave me, all the same to her. Well, I don't need to put up with it. There are other girls who would be thrilled to be my fiancée, none of this 'Don't bother coming to visit this weekend; I'll be busy entertaining guests' rot. I should tell her that if she feels that way, she should just call the whole wedding off."

I recognized my cue. "You don't mean that. You love Angela, after all. And she, you."

"Hah!"

"'Hah?' What you mean by 'hah?'"

"I mean 'hah!'" Thus encouraged, he ranted on about Angela's faults. I heard none of it. Here in the Drones Club, nothing had changed, and yet for me everything was different. I had looked down the barrel of a gun. I had kissed and more than kissed Jeeves. A warm feeling spread through my chest and I smiled what was, I confess, probably a soppy sort of smile, but love does strange things to a man, making him contemplate doing outrageous things like writing poetry dedicated to his beloved's beautiful azure eyes. Tuppy, fixated on his own problems, noticed neither my lack of response nor my drippy expression.

I finished my juice and stood, clapping Tuppy on the shoulder. "Cheer up, old man. If you love each other, and it was meant to be, you'll find a way through all adversities. Something something amor, you know."

Tuppy's broad face crinkled in confusion. "What are you blathering about, Bertie?"

I waved a hand, magnanimously ignoring his hostile tone, for I was in too good a mood to let it be spoilt. "Can't stay and chat, I'm afraid. I'm expected for lunch with Aunt Agatha. Toodle-pip! And good luck with Angela."

Tuppy gave a desultory wave and returned to his drink while I skipped out of the club. The walk wasn't long, although with each step I felt my feet growing heavier and heavier as reluctance clamped its iron chains about my ankles. I arrived at the hotel where my aged relation was staying sooner than I'd hoped and was immediately ushered into the dining room.

Aunt Agatha was perched at one end of a long table, like a vulture on a dry branch of a dead oak tree. I claimed the seat to her right, sitting at the very edge of the chair, ready to make a break for it at first opportunity. Lunch was already set out and awaited only my arrival.

"What-ho, old relation!" I said, plastering a polite smile on my face as I reached for the fork. Family is family, after all, and it wouldn't do to be rude.

"How many times must I ask you to speak like a civilized person, Bertie?"

"Oh, sorry," I avoided meeting her disapproving gaze. I cleared my throat and began again. "How do you do, Aunt Agatha?"

"Abysmal. There are tradesmen running about the house everywhere, wreaking havoc, tracking mud about the floors. It is an utter mess. I shall be extending my stay here until they finish the job and leave."

"Tradesmen? Did a pipe break?"

"Nothing of the sort. Percy and I decided to have a new burglar alarm installed, on account of the wretched goings on."

"Goings on?" At first I couldn't fathom to what she was referring, news of the outside world having passed me by for those few days I was Roberson's guest, but the reference to a burglar alarm put my mind on the right track. "Oh, you mean the theft of the Jewels of Whatsit."

"Of course I mean the theft!" She sighed piteously. "A priceless heirloom stolen right from the de Glanville home. What is this country coming to?"

"Well I--"

"Hush, Bertie. Whatever idiotic thing you were going to say, refrain from saying it."

I nodded silently and took another bite, thinking of one of Jeeves's little quips, something about discretion being the better part of valour.

"Lady Elizabeth is naturally distraught," Aunt Agatha continued. "The thieves must have passed right by her bedroom door! She could have been murdered in her sleep!"

"I don't think--"

"Don't interrupt. It's people like you who are the cause of this."

I choked on my fish. "Me?" I squeaked out, wondering if Aunt Agatha had somehow divined my role in the affair.

"Yes, you. If you and your hooligan friends weren't off stealing policemen's helmets and swimming in public fountains and engaging in other such nonsense, the police wouldn't be wasting their time dealing with the likes of you and letting hardened criminals like these jewel thieves dance about England."

I blinked away the peculiar image of Holmes and Watson doing a tango in Berkeley Square. "Dancing is not the word I would--"

"Quiet, Bertie, I'm trying to make a point that you would do well to listen to."

I nodded, but said nothing. Aunt Agatha spoke, "This recent yearning of yours to settle down in a house and raise a family is all well and good, but frankly, I don't trust you to pick out a tie, much less a wife. You need someone of strong will and good character to temper your wayward manner, someone who will convince you to make something of yourself."

I nodded again, although it was hesitant and convulsive, a nod offered more out of self-preservation than agreement.

Aunt Agatha continued, "Jeeves informed me that you have been stepping out with a girl and were planning to propose." There was a grim silence, the sort of silence that comes just before the executioner's axe falls. "Who is she?"

I thought of Jeeves and his advice, namely, to tell Aunt Agatha that I'd asked the filly but she refused and wedding bells would not be ringing. The image of Jeeves, however, called to mind the declarations of the previous night. For the second time that day, inspiration came upon me. Clearly, the Muse of Prevaricating-to-friends-and-relations was with me today. Thus, I leapt in with both feet to weave my story.

"A servant," I said.

"A servant?" Aunt Agatha echoed in disgust.

"Yes. But this person is quite the smartest, cleverest, most attractive domestic that ever there was. I declared my love last night and to my good fortune, my regard was returned."

"Bertram Wilberforce Wooster," she roared. I quailed in my seat. It was not often that Aunt Agatha felt need to resort to middle names. "Of all the absurd, cracked-headed things you've done in your life, and there have been more than can be counted, this is the worst!"

"Really?" I mused that she must be more ignorant of the antics of the last few years than I'd thought to warrant making such a statement. Certainly, stealing Sir Watkyn Bassett's cow creamer was a far wilder endeavour than courting a servant. Or pretending to be Rosie M. Banks, romance author extraordinaire, surely deserved more of a raised eyebrow than a cross-class understanding.

"I don't care how charming you think she is. You will break off the affair immediately."

"I can't do that," I retorted. "I have a Code. It would be a breach of promise."

"You've ended engagements in the past. More than can be counted."

"Well, technically, I didn't end them; the female half of the contract always let me off the hook."

Aunt Agatha's wrinkles sagged in a fierce frown. "I know that you have ways of slipping out of engagements when it suits you. Don't think I haven't noticed. Either get her to end it or do it yourself. It doesn't matter which, so long as there is no marriage. Give her fifty pounds to keep her quiet and send her on her way."

"If such is your will, aged aunt, I can promise you that there will be no wedding." I let that sink in, feeling very pleased with myself. As much as I might wish to marry Jeeves before God and all the rest, we'd have to settle for a gentlemen's agreement.

I was happier than lunch with Aunt Agatha had ever before been known to warrant. The supposed close brush with the horror of having a maidservant for a niece-in-law would, with luck, prevent my aunt from bringing up the dreaded "m" word for a while. Perhaps I would get a nice little house after all, and Jeeves would ensure that it remained wife-free. We would then live out our days in conjugal bliss. Not even Aunt Agatha could spoil the joy such daydreams inspired.

And so the luncheon passed without further grief. Nevertheless, I was pleased when I was dismissed. Even for one in the best of moods, Aunt Agatha's company is a bitter pill to swallow, and furthermore, I was eager to return home to Jeeves. I bought a bottle of Château d'Yquem on the way home and had some notion of presenting it to him and then inviting him to go take in a show if there was nothing interesting happening on the Roberson front.

Instead, I returned to mayhem. The front door was open and four bobbies were packed in my sitting room. An inspector with grizzled hair, a thin, wolfish sort of face, and clad in a rumpled suit was putting Dr. Watson in handcuffs while Jeeves attempted to curb the madness.

"What the devil is going on?" I asked, setting the wine on the sideboard.

The inspector passed the manacled Dr. Watson into the care of a police sergeant. He approached me with a slow and steady tread. "My name is Inspector Cinwell, Scotland Yard. You must be Mr. Wooster," he spoke in a flat and jaded tone. "Were you aware that you were harbouring a dangerous criminal?"

"Harbouring a--" I chuckled in confusion. "You must be joking. Dr. Watson? A dangerous criminal? Why, he's the kindest, most decent chap I've ever met."

"You've been taken in, I'm afraid. The good doctor here is a master thief."

"Master thief?"

"He's under arrest for breaking into the de Glanville residence and stealing the famous Jewels of Tarpeia."

I sputtered. "But that's--How--? What about Mr. Holmes?"

Cinwell raised his brows in puzzled inquiry. "What about him?"

"Is he in trouble, too?" If Watson, who only accompanied Holmes on the heist was headed for the magistrate, then it seemed reasonable to me to assume that he who planned and carried out the bulk of the crime would likewise be facing the judge's bench. Inspector Cinwell's reply was therefore baffling.

"Mr. Holmes is an old friend of the police," the inspector said without a trace of irony��"a little too sincere, if you know what I mean. "He can hardly be blamed if his colleague strayed from the straight and narrow. Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Wooster, I really must get on with my job. We may have questions for you later, so don't leave town."

The police began to drag Watson from the room. All remaining traces of my earlier joy vanished utterly when I saw the hopeless and despairing look on his face. As he passed by, he muttered to me, "Tell Holmes what happened."

Soft though his words were they were not soft enough to escape the sharp hearing of Inspector Cinwell. He stood before me and said, "Yes, by all means, Mr. Wooster, tell Holmes what happened. Leave out no detail, no matter how unimportant." He fixed me with a brief but piercing gaze from his heavy-lidded, pale eyes and a chill trickled down my spine like drops of water sliding down a melting icicle. With that, he tipped his hat and left, leaving the flat quiet and empty but for Jeeves and me.

Jeeves poured me a stiff one before I even needed to ask. I gulped it down without pause. Despite the fact that the arrest had just happened before my very eyes, I couldn't imagine how it could have come to pass. I expressed my uncertainty to Jeeves.

"How did they know? Holmes said they left no clues behind, and if anyone would know about clues, you'd think it would be Sherlock Holmes."

"It is more troubling than that, sir. Consider, even if some sort of clue were found that incriminated Dr. Watson, who, other than you or I would know that he was temporarily residing here. It should have taken many days for the police to track Dr. Watson down, not hours."

When the answer came to me, my jaw dropped. "Good heavens! I say, Jeeves, good heavens! You think that Roberson put the police on Dr. Watson's scent?"

"Holmes himself intimated that Roberson had connections in law enforcement whom he bribed to escape capital punishment. It would appear that at least some of those connections are still in place."

"So Roberson arranged for Watson to be arrested?"

"I think it likely, sir."

"But why not Holmes while he was at it? Why all that 'friend of the police' whatsit?"

"If Roberson's prior modus operandi is any evidence, I would surmise that Roberson wishes to make another exchange and has made Dr. Watson his new hostage."

I lit a gasper and paced up and down the sitting room. Things were getting decidedly beyond rummy and all the way towards disastrous. Every time one of us turned around, there was Roberson, chipping away at our fortifications. We needed a plan.

"Jeeves, we need a plan."

"I concur. There's little we can do, however, until Mr. Holmes arrives."

"Where is he?"

"He left shortly after you did to gather information on Roberson. He has not yet returned."

"He's going to blow his lid when he finds out what's happened. I know I would if it were you who was locked up." I yearned to put my hand on Jeeves's shoulder, to feel his strong arm underneath my palm and gain reassurance from it, but the whole notion was so awkward now in the bright mid-afternoon and in the relative public of the sitting room. What happened under the fire of ardour in the bedroom was one thing but I wasn't sure that Jeeves would approve of such casual touches in the daylight. I'd crossed the line between master and valet last night, and now when I turned around and looked back, I couldn't be sure where it was anymore, what was appropriate and what was not.

I settled for standing close enough to him that my sleeve brushed against his. He did not object to my invasion of his space; in fact, he reached out and ran his fingers down my lapels, as if straightening them out, even though I knew with some certainty that they were in no need of adjustment. I, heartened by this action, brushed a mote of non-existent dust from Jeeves's impeccable shoulder with a slow and firm stroke. He did not draw away or seem impatient with my touch, and my heart rallied at the novelty of touching Jeeves in my sitting room in such an intimate manner. A speck of the hopelessness which had gripped me broke off and drifted away, leaving my mind just a little bit lighter. Thus bolstered, I waited for Holmes's return and prepared myself for the unenviable task of breaking the news to him.

When Holmes arrived, he swept into my quiet flat like a whirlwind, bringing chaos to Jeeves's order, tossing scuffed cobalt blue hat on the sofa and frayed jacket over the lampshade. He spoke quickly and wandered the room incessantly, not pausing even while lighting up a cigarette.

"Roberson has been busy. He's re-established many of his old contacts--those who aren't dead or in prison--and has been forging new connections with the local gangs near the docks. It all suggests that he has already started up his old business again. Indeed, I suspect that, although it may have slowed after his arrest, it never entirely died. He had subordinates to look after his legitimate shipping interests while incarcerated; in all likelihood, he had similar arrangements made for his illegitimate merchandise." The last word of Holmes's speech was spoken with a bitter curl of his lip. He stopped and looked at us for the first time since he'd entered. A frown deepened the hollows of his face and I quailed. He asked, "Where's Watson?"

I shuffled my feet. "Well, you see, the police were here when I returned��"returned from my visit to Aunt Agatha, if you recall whom I was going to visit. After I visited her." I licked my lips and rocked on my heels, putting off saying what needed to be said. Holmes's icy gaze, which seemed to drop by degrees with each word I spoke, wasn't making my difficult task any easier. "Everything seemed oojah-cum-spiff when I left the house, what? Not a trouble to be seen in the immediate future. So you can imagine my surprise when I come home to find an invasion in progress, bobbies every which where and a Scotland Yard inspector and the works. And Dr. Watson there right in the middle of the commotion. He--that is to say, Dr. Watson--he was...in a state of...the process of being..." I paused, mouth open, hoping the necessary words would make themselves known, but no sound emerged. Jeeves, as always, came to my rescue.

"Dr. Watson was arrested, sir," Jeeves said.

I watched Holmes with the uncomfortable look a rabbit might give upon finding himself face to face with a lean and hungry fox, that is to say, my shoulders hunched and I braced myself for whatever sort of scathing attack might be forthcoming. I could see the muscles of Holmes's jaw roll under the skin of his thin face as his teeth clenched.

"Tell me what happened, and omit no detail, no matter how trivial it may seem to you."

I shivered at the feeling of déjà vu--or would it be déjà entendu --that came over me. "That's exactly what he said! Inspector Cinwell, he said that I was to tell you what happened and spare no detail."

Holmes's mien, which had been grim before, became downright sepulchral. "Tell me," he repeated, his voice flat and low. I related the story as precisely as I could remember it, Jeeves filling in details now and again. Holmes was utterly still and silent throughout. His cigarette burnt down, forgotten, until it singed his fingers, and even then he showed little distress, merely flicking the offending stub into a nearby brandy snifter. When I'd finished my tale, I did not move or speak, waiting for Jeeves or Holmes or someone to come up with a fruity scheme to break Watson out of gaol, a file-baked-in-the-cake sort of deal or well-placed explosives by the wall, for we could not in good conscience simply leave him to his fate.

Jeeves did not disappoint. "We would be best served by first discovering what sort of evidence they have against Dr. Watson. If it is merely circumstantial--"

Whereas I was hanging on Jeeves's every word, as sure of his good sense and acumen as I am sure that the sun rises in the east, Holmes harboured no such appreciation. Retrieving neither hat nor jacket, he left the flat without a word.
