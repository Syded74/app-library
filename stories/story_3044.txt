<p>Author's note:&nbsp; This story is mere reverie resulting form a liaison with
my lover.&nbsp; I like to travel, preferably by car, and this just came up out
of my imagination.&nbsp; Rowr...&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">We
stand on the side of a hill that looks out on Jackson Hole, Wyoming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If you have never seen a picture, it is nearly impossible to describe,
but here goes
</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Stretched
out before us is a slope that bottoms out near a river.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here and there are small stands of Pine and Aspen trees, vying for
supremacy on this sunlit hillock of the Rocky Mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Trees cover the feet of the hill in copses leading to and lining the
river, about a mile and a half away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Beyond
the river is a valley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
covered with trees and lush grasses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aspens
are turning bright gold in the afternoon sunshine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They signal that it is late September, and the breeze blows cool after
the heats of summer.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
valley stretches six miles to the base of the stark and awesome Teton Range,
five peaks that thrust up to the sky like knives in the west.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The stone grays and blacks and whites of the mountains contrast sharply
with the lush green and gold of the valley.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">There
are no clouds in the sky, only eagles riding the winds in a leisurely winged
waltz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are large animals in
the valley, elk and antelope and buffalo, while chipmunks and squirrels keep us
company on the high slope above.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">We
are walking down the hill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
dont know if we were planning to enter the valley, as we do not make it very
far before I turn to look at you.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Your
face, browned slightly by the sun, is protected by a wide-rim straw hat that you
made yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You wear a loosely
fitting calico dress and barely dent the grass with your bare feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I
seem to be wearing a hat with a broad brim, a white cotton humespun shirt,
trousers with suspenders, and boots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
turn and hug, your face buried in my chest as the scent of your hair fills my
senses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I start to fall over a
little, bringing you with me, and before you can compensate, we are fallen over
into the waist high grass, laughing and disappearing from view.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">In
my dreams there is no speech, but speech is hardly needed for me to sense your
mood as you look first at me quizzically (what have you done?) then play-pouty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Im pretending to be upset with you.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;reach over to you and offer my look back to you,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>(Well, I meant no harm. On the contrary) and you
smile a great big smile and leap into my arms on top of me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As I gather you in, I roll over and am on top of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You are pinned beneath me, and I hold your hands up high over your head
as I look down at you.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I
take my time, inventorying your form and face in full, before I ease down on you
and begin to kiss you, first your brows and cheeks, then your lips and chin, and
then to your throat and neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am
determined to mark you thus, but you wiggle free and place your face before mine
again, reaching for my mouth with your eyes and lips.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">O!
How passionate a creature you are!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Burning
me and melting under my touch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your
kisses reach me and bring my desire and love to the forefront.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is vain to try to describe the pleasures and warmth of our kisses to
one who has not experienced them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no legend, no reality, no imagined story to match the power of those kisses
to inflame our hearts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
sun beaming down, warming us more while the breeze caresses and cools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A blanket is produced and spread, and we fall together as the birds in
the trees sing their appreciation of our loving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As we struggle, the sun hangs still in the sky, unwilling or unable to
take our leave behind the mountains.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">At
first, we make love urgently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
all, that is the way of things with us, that time is of the essence and
consummation must be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But then we
are not rushed, not called urgently back to the pumpkin land of our chosen
reality, but rather lie leisurely and bask in the westering sun as I explore
your body with eyes and hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
know your face, she being the one I so strongly desire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I search your neck and find your breath under your throat  I settle
down on it to graze over the smooth skin  alabaster yet tinted in earth tones
from the sun, with loves salt and spice completing the feast.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">And
feast I do, gnawing and sucking and kissing your throat, ever feeling you
breathe and swallow as the edge grows again on your passion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My hands are not idle either, and caress you from your head to your
belly, and as my mouth closes about your windpipe my hands close on your
breasts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both of my weapons squeeze
simultaneously, and I taste your skin on my tongue and on my fingertips.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">My
face moves, convinced that I have eaten the last bit of the lovely flesh of your
neck, and down I reach, mixing the sweat of my hands and mouth with the glow of
your belly and breasts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A nipple is
enough, one at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it is
difficult to remember , in the midst of my hunger, which was first tasted, so I
back and forth go between your nipples until I am satisfied that Ive eaten
all they have to give.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I
move my mouth down to your belly and trace the outline of your naval with my
tongue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My hand is now between your
legs, gently massaging the object of your sex, while my tongue follows the happy
trail between your belly button and your nether button.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I spread your legs apart to see the wondrous prize, and dip down my head
into your vee and inhale the scent of you and me love made.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
kisses begin light and few.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I lean
over you to come closer, then lie down on you, completing the imprisonment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You, nervous at first, fall back down into half-dreams, letting yourself
go completely in my power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My arms
around your thighs, I pry your legs apart farther and begin an excavation with
my tongue, tasting with delight what has so far been forbidden to me.
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">But
you can not lie still for long, and my invasion of your body has you in throes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What are they?!? Pleasure? Pain? the pleasure-pain of ticklishness?
Whatever it is, I am thrown off you roughly and you are on top of me, kissing
and biting my face, neck, and chest while your legs embrace mine while you press
and grind against my hips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My arms
are around you and yet useless to stop the onslaught, and I give in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>
</span>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Lying back, I return your kisses and grind my self
against your hips in return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
brings to bear the forgotten element, a new weapon in the battle of our bodies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He rises slowly, but steady, until he stands out against the grass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have a new strategy now, and I use the last of my reserve strength to
maneuver you above the spike and transfix you upon it.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The sun, now fleeing westward, seeks the asylum of the
mountains in haste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Again our
actions catch and still the aging orb, pausing all of life while our bodies meet
and begin to dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I feel a
squeeze, and another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I lift your
head and torso up from lying on my neck and I gaze at you, held aloft by hands
and impaled on me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your hair falls
down from your face to mine and we are in a golden tunnel of your hair, face to
face, sex to sex.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My hands move from your breasts to your ribs just below,
and I gently lift you up off of me slightly, and drop you again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I lift up again, and this time ease you back down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I lift and drop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I lift and
ease down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lift, down. Lift, down.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Where are you during all of this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Your face is close to mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
help by placing your hands on my shoulders and pushing against me as I lift you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then your arms collapse and you are on me again, spiked deep
and waiting for the onslaught you desire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
sit up with you on my lap, place my hands one on each cheek of your beautiful
behind, and lift, more evenly this time, moving you up and down like a butter
churn, mixing our fluids together to make a very special honey.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The sun is taking leave of us, and our pace quickens to
match the pace of Sols retreat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no world, no humanity, no mountains, only the sun and our lovemaking in the
grass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The entire world shrunk to
just that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By now I am back on top of you, working my will by
plunging deep into you as you lay on your back.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My hand is at your throat, holding fast but safe, and my
other is positioned to assist in your climax by gripping your ass and working
its way closer to your sex.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">My charge is near complete, and I quicken my pace and you
yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your reach up to pull me to
you, but your efforts only succeed in tightening my grip on your throat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As I begin to climax, I fall onto one elbow and press my chest over your
body, squeezing the air from your lungs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
ardor is about spent when I hear you gasp like Ive never heard, then you
scream !! That sound is the final straw for me, and I plunge into you, pouring
out my seed inside you as wave after wave of bucking and screams and coughing
overcome both of us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I am not still, as I remain strong from the renewed
anointing of our sex makes us all slippery and I enter and exit you freely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How long will I continue to pound away?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Youve receded into calm now, Ive slowed but not stopped, and I am
looking at you newly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I lift your legs again, plying along your slit, eliciting new
sounds as you press back against me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
lift your legs higher, hooking them over my shoulders and rub your bottom
against my hardness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Im ready to
enter you again, and take this chance to penetrate your rear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I press against the entrance and rub along it, spreading the moisture of
our lovemaking into your crack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
sense my desire and push against me, positioning yourself so there is only one
place for me to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I put my hands on each side of your hips and lift.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Your ankles lock around my neck and pull me to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My hands pull you in to me and part your cheeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am pressing hard against the spot that will either admit or reject me,
and I feel your body relax and slump against me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am admitted!</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Ive penetrated only a short way, yet I feel the heat
and tension that comes with this new territory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I move to withdraw a bit, but I am caught tight in the tight grip of your
muscles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, I move in a little.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The muscles relax enough to admit me about an inch, then tense again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again I go to withdraw, am held tight, and press in some more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While we do this slow new dance, I am looking at your
face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your eyes are closed tight at
first, as if in anticipation of a blow, but as I gently stab you, your face
becomes calmer and your eyes nearly open.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
want to see your eyes looking at me as I fill you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Almost on cue, you open your eyes to see me smiling down at you, a look
of intense concentration taking over my features as we stare at one another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Can you feel that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
do your senses interpret my actions?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Am I an invader, ravishing you against all natural norms?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Or do our actions produce a new sensation of pleasure for you, that
pleasure that sometimes walks hand in hand with pain?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the pain  will it fade, allowing the pleasure to come through and
bring you to climax this way, or will the pleasure behind the pain eventually
fade, with only the diminishing memory of it, and with you sore and broken
beneath me?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I am determined to seek the answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I press down harder in you and begin to move with purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lifting and shifting you, I plunge down and back, manipulating your
behind to secure the deepest and fullest insertion until I push your behind back
and withdraw again.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Again! and Again! and Again! I fill you and withdraw,
testing the limits of your pleasure and pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The pleasure is winning out, and additional moisture continues to
lubricate us as I pick up the tempo of my thrusts.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As each entry reaches bottom, my hips pounding into yours
with a SLAP! I watch your breasts quiver and your teeth grip your bottom lip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A grunt, a snarl, a gasp in turn escape your lovely mouth as I SLAP down
to your hips again and again.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The outline of my hands is becoming visible on your hips
as I grip you harder to pull you to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Deep
inside you I sink, the taut grip my hands forcing you onto my lance, and then I
release you some as I withdraw until my other head is just inside your clenching
muscle. Then I grip your hips again and force my way in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The sun has set at last and the quick darkness of the
wilderness fills the spaces between the peaks across the valley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Looking up, you see the first stars of the night in a clear and close
sky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am losing my grip, slowing
down to a crawl as the solar instigator ducks its head and pulls its warming
rays along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I half collapse on you,
bending your legs forward to your chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still
inside you, I feel for the ground beneath you to prop me up, gazing into your
face as the shadows cover it with soft grays and black.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I tumble over but you stay with me, unwilling to let me
slip from your grasp, either in loving comfort or in fear of the ripping pain
that may attend my sudden departure from your backside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At last I am limp enough to slip out of you gently, and you pull away
from my fading spear and off.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The stars twinkle and gleam as darkness now reigns
supreme here in the wild.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
breeze picks up and licks the cooling perspiration from our bodies and salves
our most heated parts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The grasses
sigh all around us and keep time to an eternal music as we watch the night
unfold above our heads.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Today was just the first of many days on the road for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As we lie in the grass as skin to skin I consider the next phase of our
journey.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">to Dove, with love, from your Moon.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;
