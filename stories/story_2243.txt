                               Sangrelysia

                          by Vivian Darkbloom

Which Tells of Reaching the Lake, and Other Events Which Followed

   Crushed by overwhelming fatigue, I reclined on my bedroll. I
   welcomed the soothing beauty of the surrounding sights and sounds
   of nature, the quiet stillness of the trees and birds on all
   sides, and the clouds gently grouping and swirling above, forming
   tantalizingly evocative shapes as they lazily made their way
   across the sky. Sylvia sat nearby, lost in the innerworldly
   mystery of the crystal tear.

   Two crows, our unwanted companions, nestled patiently a stone's
   throw away.

   The speed of our journey was severely impeded by my shortage of
   stamina. While the stabilizing spell that Sylvia had cast was
   effective in reducing the most painful of the symptoms, our daily
   hiking had revealed that my body was still not up for more than a
   few hours of strenuous effort in a day.

   Didn't stop me from feeling horny, though.

   I glanced over to where my lovely dark-haired maiden sat
   cross-legged on a rattan mat, hunched over in concentration,
   taking advantage of the time I needed for resting, stealing every
   spare moment to increase her rapport.

   After our encounter with Delphia, and through her the Ancient
   Mother, Sylvia had experienced a complete reversal in her
   attitude towards the crystalline globe. Now that she knew the
   cause of the melancholy that permeated it, what had been a
   fearsome unknown was now an understood sadness, and her suspicion
   had turned into fascination.

   In addition to the images that both of us caught sight of in the
   crystal, glimpses of the path as we went along our way to guide
   us on the journey ahead, my beloved Sylvia was developing a
   closer, more intimate familiarity with the dragon's tear, and
   through it her relationship with the dragon. She could connect
   (or so she told me) with the profound depths of the dragon's
   depression, and the sorrow of a mother yearning for her unborn
   child.

   Now it was my turn to get a little nervous about her association
   with the crystalline globe. Not that I'm philosophically opposed
   to dragons or dragon-ness of any sort, but seeing as they do tend
   to be rather large and toting around sharp claws and fangs, I
   wasn't so sure how intimate I wanted her to be with feeling the
   dragon's pain.

   Still, it seemed like her rapport might turn out to be a valuable
   asset, so I kept my skepticism to myself.

   "How's it going?" I called over to her.

   "Huh? Sorry, I'm concentrating. Were you talking to me?"

   "How is your little project coming along?" I asked.

   "I think I'm starting to understand what it's like to be a
   dragon, to be so huge and powerful, and intelligent but unable to
   really speak or write or anything. I think they transmit their
   magical understanding to each other through telepathy, but I'm
   not sure. It's like I'm linked in with a consciousness that's
   lonely and yearning for someone to communicate with, but doesn't
   really trust me yet with all of its secrets."
     ____________________________________________________________

   One day, a little over a week after we had set out, we both began
   to find images inside the crystal, of a large body of water.

   "Do you think that's it?" I asked my dear sweet Princess as we
   she led the way on the path up the steep mountainside. The
   refreshing morning chill was prescient of the day's coming heat
   and humidity.

   "Of course that's it."

   "I mean, how do we know it's not just some other lake, on the way
   to the `Lake of the Virgin,' and so we'll get there only to find
   that it's the wrong lake, and the real one we want is over the
   next hilltop? I was just wondering. I mean, I didn't notice any
   sign or anything."

   "Trust me, that's it," she said. "That's the Lake of the Virgin."

   "And why are they calling it that in the first place? Does it
   refer to the Virgin Mary, or to some other virgin who was
   devoured by dragons in a gruesome blood ritual. . ."

   "You had to say that. Now I'll never sleep."

   "Sorry."

   "Only thing is, that dragons don't eat humans," she said.

   "How can you be certain?"

   She smirked. "And besides, I don't think either of us needs to
   worry about qualifying for the `virgin' part."

   And so on.

   It was as we crested the pass between two mountainous hillsides
   that the glittering surface of the lake came into view. At first
   we caught the first glimpse in the distance, through the trees,
   and the smell of water subtly on the breeze.

   As we descended into the valley, we began to see between the
   intervening trunks and leaves that the lake was nearby as well as
   being distant. It was huge. It was enormous, and presumably deep.

   Beautiful, with a clarity that revealed the crisp white gravely
   sand near the shoreline beneath the surface.

   "I've noticed something about this lake," I said.

   "What's that?"

   "It's incredibly large, comparatively speaking. Also. . ."

   "Yes,"

   "It would appear to be rather deep."

   "Your point being?"

   "Well, even supposing we could find a boat somehow, and supposing
   the visibility is so miraculously clear that we could distinguish
   the round boulders on the bottom from a dragon's egg, which by
   the way I've never seen one of ever before; how do we know that
   one of us can hold our breath long enough to dive down and
   retrieve it, not knowing, also by the way, how enormously heavy
   the thing may well be?"

   She tossed her head casually. "You just need to learn to be more
   optimistic, that's all!" she said, smiling.

   "Right."

   It must have taken an hour or so to make our way cautiously down
   the switchbacks leading down into the valley. Our trail came to
   an abrupt end at the sandy beach, nearby the tail of a stream
   which fed into the larger expanse.

   "So this is the Lake of the Virgin," said Sylvia.

   "Now what?" I asked, setting down my pack and taking a seat on a
   log at the lake's edge. I saw our two unwanted companions, the
   large black crows, settling in the upper limbs of a tree opposite
   from us, down the shoreline, across the water.

   Sylvia silently placed the crystal in her palm, and stood gazing
   out over the beautiful refractive ripples.

   I shrugged and got up, wandering around to explore the nearby
   beach and riverside. Dipping my hand in the water, I determined
   that it was icy cold. Snow melt, most likely. A bit chilly to
   swim in.

   I made my way around a bend in the river, and reclining by the
   streamside I meditated on seemingly ceaseless flowing of the
   water, thinking of the journey of the water, through
   precipitation, blizzarding snowflakes, and landscape blanketed in
   frozen snow, to springtime melting into tiny creeks merging into
   bigger ones, in shapes echoing those of the trunk and branches of
   the trees around me. Through the leaves I watched the clouds
   slowly drifting overhead.

   I think I must have dozed off for a short while. When I returned,
   Sylvia had opened her pack and taken out her sketchpad, the one
   which our mysterious antechronal doppelgaengers had given back,
   long ago in the royal castle.

   She had it opened to the page with a picture that showed her
   being led down a slope underwater by a parade of fish, with a
   giant golden Koi in the front. Sylvia studied the drawing for
   some time.

   Then, placing it aside, she opened her pack once more, and asked
   for my help taking out her harp. Once we had set it up, she sat
   on the stool and began strumming, faintly humming a familiar
   melody.

   "What are you singing?" I asked, sitting down beside her.

   "A song my mother taught me when I was little. The words are in
   ancient Sangrelysian and I forget what it's about, but the melody
   sort of floated into my head as I was sitting here. "

   As I sat and listened, presently she closed her eyes and began to
   sing, and I fell into dazed adoration of her hypnotically
   beautiful soprano voice:

   Ea uthanlie o cliaran shea
   Fae atham o/ miara zo embra

   Fae sha clath kre uphthe zer apth rauo/l
   Ner asque niasch atham schaee o miaro/l

   Uae cial lleth nya
   Uae cial lleth nya

   Aino/th orpha l`aloth seya nasco/l
   Er ho`itha uth senn myria ez ra hautho/l

   Mu a lluthanrie u miaro wea
   Sae ratho/r e niasch az orthera

   Uae cial lleth nya
   Uae cial lleth nya

   Over and over she sang it, as a chant, until the meaning faded
   into the vibrations of the air over the water, into the mystery
   of the contemplations of the wise and ancient mountain, into the
   endless infinity of the skies, into the invisible circles of
   angels and ancestors surrounding us everywhere present inside
   each breath.

   Below the shimmering surface of the water as she sang, I caught
   glimpse of an elusive movement. It disappeared when first I
   looked at it, but then the motion grew larger and more distinct
   beneath the refractive waves. My first thought was that a large
   school of fish had come our way, perhaps just in their daily
   circling of the lake, or curious about the presence of other
   creatures in this ordinarily desolate surrounding.

   Then I saw that the figures were not fish at all, but beautiful
   young girls, who swam suspended in sensuous curvaceous dances,
   gazing curiously at us, hair curling weightless in the aqueous
   chill, faces smiling, skin porcelain white.

   Sylvia, with her eyes closed, hadn't noticed the movement in the
   lake, but she broke off abruptly from singing with a short laugh.
   "Now I remember. It's something about water nymphs."

   "You think, really?" I asked, pointing to the submerged pale
   naked feminine figures gathering before us, one of whom
   prominently placed herself in the center, wearing a silver crown,
   riding a giant golden Koi.

                                                          Chapter 22
