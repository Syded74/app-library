              Now Eliphaz had a guest.  His black-cloaked visitor seated himself on an antique,<BR>

              particular interest in the tracks that his and Eliphaz' feet had made through the dust on<BR>
              the floor, and the pretzel-shaped clearing of the dust that existed in the middle of the<BR>
              room.  Eliphaz looked upon the intruder's curiosity with disdain; either the man was<BR>

              Eliphaz grunted.  He seated himself in a high, wing-backed chair with dark leather<BR>
              cushions and brass tacks.  &#34;Well then,&#34; he said.  &#34;Suppose we just skip over all the<BR>
              pleasantries and get right to the point.  I'm not a person who appreciates being<BR>

              Eliphaz had no reply.  For perhaps the first time in his life he found himself to be<BR>

              why he alone was destined to live, on and on, while everyone and everything around<BR>
              him aged, withered and died.  Time and time again, for literally thousands of years, his<BR>
              mind had returned to that topic, and always it had proven to be a mental pursuit through<BR>
              questions, questions, questions and the finding of not a single answer.  And now,<BR>
              incredibly, after all that time, a man was standing, or sitting rather, before him, telling<BR>

              &#34;You may not think this has much to do with anything, but let me tell you right off,<BR>
              it's the cornerstone upon which my life's story is founded: my father was an atheist.<BR>
              When I was seven I approached my father with one of the typical questions of life that<BR>
              a seven year old is inclined to ask.  I asked him what happens to people when they die.<BR>
              Do you know what he said?  He said dying was like falling asleep... like being<BR>
              unconscious.  I asked if people dreamed when they were dead and he said no, all they<BR>
              do is lie there decomposing; unconscious, rotting.  I asked him about heaven and God<BR>
              and he said they were both concepts made up by men who were just afraid to face up<BR>
              to the fact of life's uniqueness -- that it only happens once -- that there is no immortal<BR>
              soul and you never get a second chance at anything.  He said there was no higher<BR>
              calling.  He said there was no purpose in life.<BR>

            <DIV CLASS="parastyle3">

              &#34;Let me tell you, Mr. Montrego, I have never been as scared in my entire life as I<BR>

              &#34;But let me also say that if it had not been for my father's faith in medicine,<BR>
              technology and science, I never would have had the upbringing in mathematics and<BR>
              engineering that I did.  And if not for that, I never would've developed the method by<BR>

              &#34;My father, while being confident that there was no God, <SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle10">was </SPAN>confident that<BR>
              everything was within the understanding of man.  He used to tell me that man, having<BR>
              the ability to build machines that can put him on the moon, split the atom, and replace<BR>
              the human heart, has the ability to do anything he puts his mind to.  But still, he laughed<BR>
              at my ambition to live forever; he said, 'Son, this is a thing which you will most<BR>
              assuredly learn: there are only two things which are inescapable facts of life -- the rest<BR>
              of it may be debatable, but these two things are not: death and taxation.'<BR>

              &#34;Yes, my father laughed at my plan.  He told me living forever was not only<BR>
              impossible but also insane.  And I greatly respect my father... for his intelligence and<BR>
              wisdom... but his words, even having millennia of human grief and experience as proof<BR>
              behind them, had no effect on me.  I knew, with a certainty, in my heart, that regardless<BR>
              of the arguments against it, life could be sustained in a man indefinitely.  It was just a<BR>
              matter of discovering how.<BR>

              &#34;Throughout the years of my education, both in high school and college, I took<BR>
              every class concerning science, medicine, mathematics and engineering available to me,<BR>
              never failing to achieve an 'A' and complete mastery of the subject.  I hungrily devoured<BR>
              every theory and every idea, mulling them over carefully; making sure that I understood<BR>
              the logic of every concept before advancing to the next.<BR>

              &#34;After achieving a Ph.D. in all the areas in which a glimpse of the scientific nature of<BR>

              At Biotech my chief area of expertise was in the research and engineering of artificial<BR>
              organs and prosthetics.  I was given my own lab and two laboratory assistants were<BR>
              placed under my charge.  My work for the company primarily consisted of<BR>
              enhancement of the nervous system; artificial stimulus response technology -- that is to<BR>
              say artificial nerves, and direct machine interfacing with the human brain.  What this was<BR>
              eventually supposed to lead up to was creating sensory equipment able to reproduce<BR>
              the sensations of sight, hearing, touch and smell -- taste was not on my list of priorities<BR>
              -- for those who were born with defects or those who had lost their response<BR>
              capabilities due to environmental misfortune.  I earned more than two hundred patents<BR>
              for Biotech in my days there, but I digress.  That was what my job for the company<BR>
              was.  My personal mission was discovery of a means by which life could be extended<BR>

              problem of longevity before me.  For lack of a better or more meaningful word, I called<BR>
              this force 'Soul,' although its properties are nothing like that of the soul which<BR>

              And with that said by way of presentation, the black figure named Greggory<BR>
              opened the cloak that kept hidden his body.   Beneath it he was wearing a black shirt<BR>
              which he set to unbuttoning.  When the front of the shirt had been totally separated,<BR>
              Eliphaz could see that modifications had been made on Greggory's original anatomy.<BR>
              Beneath the flesh that covered his rib-cage, strange, mechanical shapes loomed --<BR>
              cylinders and tubes and spheres stuck out from his abdomen in bas-relief, and the flesh<BR>
              itself, with which his body was clad, had a most unnatural sheen.  Truly, his skin<BR>
              seemed to be made more of a vinyl or plastic, the way the light revealed it.<BR>

              Greggory lowered his hood then, exposing his face, and Eliphaz could not help but<BR>
              gasp in wonderment.  The lower half of Greggory's face -- nose and mouth -- had been<BR>
              sealed over (replaced) by an object that stuck out from his jaw like a blunted<BR>
              proboscis.  It looked a little bit like a gas mask had somehow fused with his skull.<BR>
              Above the mask, Greggory's eyes were orbs screened by a smoke-tinted plate of glass<BR>
              that was flush with the plane of his forehead, like a surgically implanted scuba mask,<BR>
              and it was filled with some clear liquid.  Below the mask, set into his throat, was a<BR>
              speaker grill, and from that plastic mesh came Greggory's voice as he began to speak<BR>
              again.<BR>

              of how best to explain the rest of his discovery.  Eliphaz made no move to interrupt<BR>
              him, he was still silent from wonder; amazed at the sight of what Greggory had done<BR>
              with his body -- he was no longer even human.  More cyborg than even The<BR>

              On the side of Greggory's head were his ears; domes with funnel shaped<BR>
              depressions set into the middle of them.  Over each funnel, a thin membrane, thin to the<BR>
              point of transparency, had been stretched like the skin on an Indian drum.  Through the<BR>
              gossamer membranes, Eliphaz could see a web of diodes and hair-fine wires, vibrating<BR>
              as sound passed through.  Greggory had no hair, and his bald head shone doubly<BR>
              bright, for it appeared as though all the flesh on his body, not just that on his chest, had<BR>
              been replaced with that shiny, pale-tan vinyl.<BR>

              The only thing necessary to my survival is that I keep the machines that sustain me well<BR>

              no doubt that as technology improves I will be able to measure the amount of escaping<BR>

              &#34;I read your book.  It greatly influenced my life.  The sections on meditation and<BR>
              broadening the horizons of human consciousness were of particular interest to me.  All<BR>

              &#34;No.  I came here for help.  You see, lately I've been having a recurring dream.  In<BR>
              this dream, I'm standing on a cat-walk that is suspended above a field of tall grasses.<BR>
              The cat-walk is completely without means of support to my eyes, it stretches to the<BR>
              point of vanishing at both horizons, and yet there are no wires or pillars anywhere that I<BR>
              can see.  The cat-walk is made of gleaming steel for the most part, but where I stand<BR>
              the walk is tiled with thick, glossy black squares like ceramic or plastic, I don't know<BR>
              which.  In my dream, I stand motionless upon this cat-walk for what seems to be<BR>
              several days, for the sun rises and sets many times.  Then, at the rising of the sun one<BR>
              morning, a dense fog is covering the land, and the range of my vision is limited to about<BR>
              fifty feet.  Now: from somewhere in the fog I hear the galloping of horses, far away and<BR>
              distant, but as time passes their thunderous hoof beats come closer and closer, and so<BR>
              close the horses are coming that I can hear the breath of the mighty beasts chuffing from<BR>
              their nostrils.  And from somewhere in their midst, there is the sound of many people<BR>
              screaming.<BR>

              &#34;Then the fog parts before me, like a stage curtain, and I see them.  Four horses<BR>
              with four riders, and they are riding straight towards me.  Once they are a few steps<BR>
              clear of the fog I see them in detail.  Here I will not bother you with unnecessary<BR>
              description, Eliphaz.  These horses and their riders have already been described by<BR>
              you... and the Apostle John.&#34;<BR>

              Greggory continued, &#34;As they ride towards me, I see they are clearing away the<BR>
              grasses of the field.  War is cutting away huge sections of the field with his sword, and<BR>
              Death is doing likewise with his scythe.  The grass before which Pestilence rides twists<BR>
              and writhes, finally turning black and then being trod to pulp beneath the hooves of his<BR>
              sickly colored horse.  Before Famine the grass is withering and turning brown as though<BR>
              brought down by extreme heat or intense drought.  And all the while they ride there is<BR>
              the sound of the screaming, and the screaming is somehow coming up from the grass as<BR>
              it is perishing.<BR>

              &#34;Now as the riders approach me on the cat-walk, they slow their steeds, until<BR>
              finally, as they are about to ride by beneath me, they come to a halt altogether.  Death<BR>
              from his seat on the black horse looks up at me.  I can see that from his blank sockets<BR>
              an unholy red-orange glow emanates.  He speaks to me:<BR>

              &#34;'Beyond our reach you may be,' he says; his voice sounds like someone shouting a<BR>
              whisper, hoarse and breathy, but loud and powerful.  'But there are other agents of the<BR>
              mission.'  And just as he stops talking the ground begins to shake and rumble.  The<BR>
              horses whinny anxiously as though with dread, and I see their eyes are wide with<BR>
              stupid, animal terror.  Then Death laughs and the riders resume their gallop.  Within<BR>
              seconds they are gone from my sight, the fog swallowing them up.  I am alone.<BR>

              Director of Research and Field Studies.  He was an executive for Biotech Industries.<BR>
              He had been ear-marked for management and executive offices early on in his career,<BR>
              when he had just gained employment for the company.  Originally chosen for his<BR>
              impressive looking certifications and educational background, he had, at one point,<BR>
              worked in the same laboratory as Greggory Clefferts.  But he had not been nearly so<BR>
              gifted in terms of intuition or original thinking as Greggory had.  He had big ideas, and<BR>
              big plans, but lacked a real capability for execution; for the actual designing of the<BR>
              devices and products Biotech was interested in developing.  So while Greggory stayed<BR>
              on, researching, designing, testing and planning in the lab, Biotech sent Timothy on to<BR>
              higher levels  where they thought his experience could be made better use of, his<BR>
              potential better tapped; delegating, supervising -- ass-kissing.  In fact, Greggory, the<BR>
              man he had started as an assistant to, was now in his chain of command; he was<BR>
              Greggory's boss.  And it was a position he relished greatly.<BR>

              Now money wise, Timothy, despite his executive status, was still a couple of rungs<BR>
              below his employee, Greggory.  The reason being that patent bonuses, prizes, and<BR>
              grants lifted the lowly engineer into a seven digit salary range, while Timothy still<BR>
              struggled to just break into six.  Timothy knew it too; knew full well where the payroll<BR>
              for his department was allocated.  And knowing how much more money his underling<BR>
              was making than he was came to be at the core of the resentment he had for Greggory.<BR>
              He knew, despite his title and status, Greggory was the real hero -- the real mover and<BR>
              shaker in his department.  And he hated him for it.  Stealing his show, his spotlight.<BR>

              So when it came to his attention, one day, that Greggory was misappropriating<BR>
              company time, funds, resources and man-hours, it was not regret that was topping his<BR>
              list of emotions when he found himself looking forward to a confrontation with the man.<BR>
              Timothy was delighted by the prospect.  He could think of no better way to spend an<BR>
              afternoon then criticizing, demeaning and denouncing the man who had caused him so<BR>
              much fruitless jealousy for so many years.  He knew, before he had even reflected on<BR>
              what Greggory's motivations might have been, that termination was the only way to<BR>
              handle such a bold transgression; such flagrant embezzlement.  Perhaps such thinking<BR>
              was selfish; not in the best interest of the company, but really, how much was a patent<BR>
              on synthetic, electrically reflexive, muscle fiber worth?  How much profit would a<BR>
              design for an artificial liver bring in?<BR>

              He sat there behind his desk, looking out his tenth story office window, a smug<BR>
              look on his face, and his fingers steepled below his chin.  He kept thinking about how<BR>
              shamed and embarrassed Greggory would be.  He liked to envision the engineer down<BR>
              on his knees, with tears streaming from his eyes, as he begged to be kept on; and<BR>
              himself, stone-hearted, rejecting his pleas.  In this day-fantasy of Timothy's, Greggory<BR>
              was even willing to take a drastic pay cut; even willing to give Timothy sixty percent of<BR>
              his patents bonus at the end of the year.  Ha!  Even as he thought, dwelling on the<BR>
              prospect of their meeting, the smugness so plain on his lips and cheeks started to be<BR>
              overshadowed by a look of smirking evil.  His face, lit by steep-slanting, afternoon sun<BR>
              that touched only on his brow and the tip of his nose, was, for a moment, the visage of<BR>
              a grinning skull.<BR>

              to look too happy about this, after all.  He wanted to look cool, calm, controlled.<BR>
              Maybe even exude an air of remorse.  He pushed the speaker phone button that would<BR>
              put him through to his secretary's desk, and then paused, unhurried, dramatic, before<BR>
