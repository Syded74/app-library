A SWITCH IN TIME

Aunt Judy was angry and a heavy dread silence hung over the
house. A plate was broken over the course of the day and Aunt
Judy had given the guilty party ample time to come forward and
confess. With no confession forthcoming, she had taken matters in
hand to root out the responsible girl. The thick oak door to her
bedroom stood closed, behind which arose a sound that thrilled
the girls with terror.

There would be no playtime today. No stories before bed. Supper,
if there was one would be plain at best. The girls would wear
their gags, fastened tightly for most of the day as well; for in
Aunt Judy's eyes if those same mouths couldn't confess their
guilt, they didn't need to speak at all.

As before, a few minutes later the door would unlock and open and
a girl would emerge, gag fastened tightly, tears streaming down
her face, her panties missing so everyone could see the bright
crimson lines across her fanny from her switching. Hands cuffed
in front prevented the girl from rubbing the pain away. Aunt Judy
would emerge only to call the next girl in with a stern toneand
the door would close and lock again.

Allison's hands shook as she wiped the glass in her hands over
and over again. It was already dry and perfectly clean but her
mind was occupied. Why hadn't she confessed? Aunt Judy would have
been upset, but considerably less upset than she was now. Not to
mention how this would stand with the other girls in the house.
All of them punished for her misdeed.

Allison found herself jumping in time to the strokes of the
switch, as if it were already striking her round bare bottom. She
noticed Nancy her dish-washing mate looking at her curiously over
her gag, hastily put the glass away and moved onto the next item
in the drying bin.

Like clockwork, the door unlocked, opened and another girl came
out, hands cuffed in front, mouth tightly gagged with a white
leather strap, panties off, her bottom decorated with dark red
welts. Allison swallowed hard.

"Allison!!" Aunt Judy shouted for the second time. None of the
the girls looked at her. Aunt Judy glared impatiently, black
leather toe tapping on the cold marble floor, but Allison found
she was rooted to the spot. Aunt Judy motioned with a long
leather gloved finger toward the door and she finally found the
strength to cross the floor and face the inevitable.

Aunt Judy said nothing, only grabbed Allison's wrists none too
gently and fastened them in a set of sturdy steel manacles
connected to a chain. A cold steel ring anchored to the floor
went around each ankle soon afterward. A button was pressed and
Allison found herself hauled forward, bent over at the waist
across a sturdy wooden stanchion her bottom in the air. Allison
trembled as aunt Judy roughly grabbed her panties and yanked them
down.

There was a long and miserable pause. Allison twisted her cuffed
hands back and forth, muscles quivering, tears already streaming
down her face. If she weren't gagged, she would have cried out
her confession then and there.

"I know it was you who broke the plate, Allison."Aunt Judy said
sternly,"I keep a close eye on everything that happens in this
house. And under normal circumstances after I switched your
bottom, I'd make you wear this lovely black leather gag with the
word LIAR stitched into the front, for all the other girls to see
and let them deal with you as they see fit. But you are my
sister's daughter..."

"So instead I've decided to switch your little ass twice what
I've done to the others. Maybe next time you'll come to me
straightaway, instead of causing all this uproar. Understand?

Allison nodded gladly.

"Good. Prepare yourself my sweet little girl."
