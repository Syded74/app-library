An Invention: The Fisherman's Delight (F torture)

"The fisherman fishes for pleasure, and this invention
provides an efficient new method guaranteed to get him his
limit of pleasure every time."

The Fisherman's Delight is easily assembled at home from
common materials.

[See diagram in web version at www.asstr.org/~quivering_flesh/fishing.html]

The Restraining Table

Any large wooden table or platform will do, provided it is
of sufficient dimensions to hold your fish (generally 5'-6'
long and 2'-2 1/2' wide.)

Affix straps to the sides of the Restraining Table as
illustrated. Bolts generally work best, though lag screws of
sufficient size will do fine. Space them appropriately to
secure the torso and midsection of your fish.

Firmly attach two sturdy struts or poles to the sides of the
table about 1/3 of the distance from the foot of the table
to the head.

Screw four eyelets into the inside of each strut. Screw a
ninth eyelet into the table near the foot, approximately an
inch from the edge.

The next steps can be completed ahead of time, but for
maximum effect, it is recommended that you wait until your
fish is strapped to the table. Make sure she is able to
fully observe all the remaining preparations. Of course, her
squirming and screaming will not detract from, but only add
to, the fisherman's pleasure.

(A note on the fish's legs: Some have complained that the
fish's legs present a problem by getting in the way of
setting the hooks properly. This problem is easily solved by
simply pulling the legs apart and the feet DOWN over the
sides of the Restraining Table, then tying them together at
the ankles UNDER the table, making sure to pull the line
sufficiently tight and secure with a Bolen knot. Any
discomfort this may cause the fish will be forgotten [by
her] immediately upon setting the first hook. [Of course,
any discomfort caused by this procedure only adds to the
fisherman's pleasure.])

To continue:

Cut four lengths of 100 lb-test fishing line (this assumes
your fish weighs no more than 400 lbs; for heavier fish, use
higher test line). Each of these lengths should be about ten
feet long. Tie to each, using a good fisherman's knot, a
barbed fishhook. Make sure to use hooks sufficiently large
for your catch.

String the first line through the apparatus as illustrated:
the shank end up through the top eyelet on the left hand
strut (from the fisherman's perspective), across to the
second eyelet down on the right hand strut and then through
the eyelet at the foot of the Restraining Table. To prevent
accidents, you might want to park the hook in the table next
to the fish (or in some fleshy, non-vital part of the fish
herself, but in my experience that tends to spoil the fish's
response to the first hook, which can be so very satisfying
for the fisherman).

The second line is a mirror image of the first: up through
the top eyelet on the right strut, over to the second from
the top eyelet on the left strut, then through the common
eyelet at the foot of the Restraining Table.

The third line goes through the bottom eyelet on the left
strut, over across to the second from the bottom eyelet on
the right strut, and through the common eyelet with it's two
companions.

The fourth, runs through the bottom eyelet on the right
strut, across to the second from the bottom on the left
strut, and home through the common eyelet.

After this preparation, you are now ready to fully utilize
the Fisherman's Delight.

The fish will, at this point, be squirming (and screaming)
energetically, but if you've secured the Restraining Straps
correctly, this will present no possibility of the fish
slipping away.

Being careful not to catch yourself (remember, safety first
when it comes to dealing with equipment as dangerous as
fishhooks), take the first hook securely in one hand. With
the other hand, grasp the top left flap surrounding the
fish's "mouth" between thumb and forefinger and pull. You
want to grasp her in such a way to provide a good thick flap
of flesh, enough to provide a solid foundation for the hook.
Try to get a piece large enough to allow you to set the hook
back from the edge of the flap at least 1/2". Apply the barb
to the fleshy flap and push it through the flap. You want to
do this as SLOWLY as possible, fully enjoying the sight of
the barbs penetrating the flesh and then emerging from the
other side. Also, the more slowly you set the hook, the more
energetically the fish will respond. (A note for beginners:
unless you've set the hooks right on the edge of the flap,
you needn't worry that the flesh will tear through. The
flaps around a fish's "mouth" are surprisingly strong.)

Some blood will ooze from the wound, but not enough to cause
(immediate) problems.

Continue similarly with the other three hooks. The second
hook goes on the same (left) side, but down lower on her
flap; the third high on the right flap, the fourth low on
the right.

Once all four hooks are set (and note, there is no need to
rush this process -- on occasion, I have taken as long as
four hours -- an hour per hook -- without losing one bit of
pleasure or becoming bored), gather the four lines together
as they emerge from the common eyelet. Adjust each line
accordingly until they are synchronized in such a way that
pulling on them together exerts an identical pull on each
hook.

The fish's "mouth" can now be opened and closed with
complete control and satisfaction. You will be amazed at how
wide her "mouth" can be pulled open without a single hook
tearing through the flesh. Indeed, it is not uncommon to be
able to be able to lift her buttocks complete off the table
by pulling on the lines alone and hold her suspended there
for some minutes before the flesh begins to give way.

As you can imagine, all sorts of amusements are possible
once your fish is properly hooked. I will just make one
suggestion that is particularly satisfying for this
fisherman: have on hand several partially frozen fish of
various sizes. It is important that they be partially frozen
so as to be somewhat stiff. These must be WHOLE fish,
completely intact. Take the smallest of the available fish,
grasp it by the tail and slowly insert it into the fish's
"mouth," head first. The chill of the dead fish will provide
some satisfaction (to the fisherman), but most of the
satisfaction comes when you withdraw the fish, for the
obvious reason that it is only upon withdrawal that the
fish's scales come into play. Work up to larger sizes of
fish. When I've done with the largest fish available, and
inserted and withdrawn it several times from my fish's
"mouth" (performing such actions faster and faster as I
proceed of course), I myself climb onto the restraining
table, position myself between her thighs, and insert my own
rod into what is by now a bloody fish mess.

Enjoy! Any comments, or suggestions for improving the
Fisherman's Delight, would be appreciated.
