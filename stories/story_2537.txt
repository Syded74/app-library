>Now where we've left off it would seem the perfect place to give
you a dream sequence
>You know, one of those things where i wake up
>walk into the kitchen
>Blood everywhere
>find Blondie finally has gone full Yandere and stabby-stabby
with all the others.
>Have an exceptionally long and drawn out swordfight and then
eventually succumb to my wounds and die.
>This would be the perfect place to draw you into an alternate
reality where the women all love me unconditionally, or where
i've become as smooth and suave as a super-spy.
>I really wish it could be the place where i have prophetic
visions of my future, of the events that lie before me.
>But i can't tell you these stories
>I don't dream
>None of those wonderful adventures happened
>My head hit the pillow, and the next thing i know i'm opening my
eyes.

>The first thing i noticed was that the pillow i was resting my
head on smelled like rose petals
>I don't know why, maybe a cleverer anon than i can figure it
out, but that was simply the first thing i noticed when i woke.
>The scent of rose petals is not a bad thing to wake up to, but a
pitch black room is.
>There was no light, none at all
>to make it worse, i had no recollection of what was in the room.
>In that funny way those things just manage to vanish when you go
to sleep at a friend's house.
>I realized the girls must have left me alone to sleep, possibly
closed the blinds and the door.
>I was left with the task of navigating my way through
pitch-black darkness, in a room that was not my own nor well
documented in my memory.
>I ended up getting out of bed like a zombie
>Arms outstretched and flailing
>They should hit things before i do, navigational aids to-say
>I know there's a lightswitch by the door, but i just have to
find it
>because of the rules involved with wandering around arms
outstretched in a dark room trying not to hit things.
>I hit my shins twice, stubbed my right toe and almost fell flat
on my face tripping on unknown obstacles.
>Finally i make it to the light switch, flip it and blink a
couple times as light floods the room.
>I turn around and try to determine what i tripped on getting
here, and there's absolutely nothing but soft objects, sleeping
bags and stuffed animals strewn around the room.
>What the hell did i hit my shins on
>spooky

>Well next on my agenda is getting some water
>My throat is dry, i probably slept with my mouth open
>I manage to use the light of the bedroom to navigate to the
hallway light switch and i flip it on
>It shallowly illuminates the area,
>It actually strikes me as weird that it's off
>It's also weird that the house is completely silent
>where the hell are the girls
>I meander from room to room turning on lights as i go and
looking for people
>Nobody
>Nobody in the living room
>Nobody in the bathroom
>Nobody in the kitchen
>Where the hell are they.

>I'm finally at my goal of the kitchen though, so i start
grabbing a glass and filling it from the tap.
>*BANG*
>I flip a shit and drop the glass
>It clinks and clatters into the sink as i'm off my feet and
turned around before they hit the floor
>There's fucking nothing in the kitchen, it sounds like it came
from the living room
>fucking hell i swear to god these girls better not be playing a
trick on me
>I'm tacticool as fuck on my tiptoes as i sneak over to the
entrance of the living room and look in
>the light is off again
>I'm being fucked with, its got to be the girls fucking with me.
>I've got this carefully concocted plan in my head on how to
discover them
>I call out "Listen i know you're there"
>No response
>Best plan.
>I hear howling in the distance

>I know that sound
>Timberwolves
>They've caught up to me in my city life after all these years
>*BANG*
>The bathroom light goes out too, and the kitchen light flickers
at the same time
>No holy shit fuck this shit
>My plan is out the window, i've got absolutely no clue what was
going on

>There's no way there was a girl in the kitchen behind me dimming
the lights, or in the bathroom, i could clearly see across the
hallway to where they would have had to come in.
>This is some paranormal activity bullshit going on right now
>I'm ready for the girls to jump out of the growing shadows and
scare me
>anytime now
>any... time

>I retreat from the living room and back to the kitchen, thank
Sol i've got light here
>I need to stop saying these things
>*BANG*
>This time it's accompanied by the sickening sound of wood on
wood
>The same sound you might get when two ships crash together out
at sea, or an old wooden dock collapses under the weight of a
truck.
>The worst part isn't even the sounds
>Its that the kitchen had taken the effort to heed my thanks to
the norse sun god and the light was off.
>The house was pitch black now
>I don't know why but there wasn't even light streaming in from
outside like there should be.
>It occurs to me that i might actually be dreaming, that this
could be the first time i've ever had a nightmare.
>Fuck

>I crouch down to the floor of the kitchen, i know i can just
find my way to the lightswitch and turn the light back on again
>I start the crawl over in the direction its in
>I hit the fridge head on
>completely wrong direction, and now my head hurts.
>I've got my bearings now, i try to crawl back towards where the
light switch is
>I'm very slow this time
>I hit my head a couple times against various things, but i
manage to not make it hurt by just not hurrying into them.
>About halfway through the kitchen i crawl through something i
could swear was cold and wet
>I'm losing my edge now, if this is a joke they're getting me
good
>i stand up and fumble around for the lightswitches
>Eventually i find one and flip it
>Nothing
>They're getting me really good

>I'm not sure what i'm supposed to do
>this isn't my house, i don't know where flashlights or candles
would be
>[spoiler]This was back before cell phones were popular with
teens, we didn't have the portable magic light devices in our
pockets 24/7 back then[/spoiler]
>To make it worse, the howling started up in the distance again
>I think its on the other side of the house
>I feel like i'm obligated to investigate, but i'm not sure what
i'll find
>You know demons, bears, timberwolves, vampires
>I would rather not find those things alone in a dark house where
i can't fairly fight back
>Im pretty sure all of those things can see in the dark.
>I'm like a helpless bunny being hunted by demonic nightvision
creatures.
>My eyes are working as hard as they can, but i can only see the
dark shapes of things
>counters, cabinets, a silhouette standing by the exit to the
living room.


>I do a double take and its gone
>Fuck
>I'm not staying here
>I'm trying to see down the hallway and discover the traps and
creatures waiting for me down it, but i can't see more than a
couple feet, and badly for those at best.
>I don't like the human figure i saw in the shadows by the living
room so i'm just going to stay as far away as possible

>I start crawling down the hallway
>The walls are closing in, suffocating darkness even
>I can't tell if there's shadows flitting across my peripheral
vision or what, but i know i'm hearing creaking sounds.
>I'm not moving
>there's still creaking in the distance
>It sounds like the creaking raven and i made earlier tiptoeing
down this hallway
>Raven

>She's probably still asleep

>I'm close to the guest room, it's like another door down
>the only problem is that creaking is down the hallway too
>I've got to beat whatever's making the creaking sounds to the
guest room, it's my only hope
>I start hurrying down the hallway, i'm keeping my shoulder to
the wall and watching the other side with anticipation
>I know its safer, they can only get at me from one side, i just
have to watch ahead of me and be-
>*BANG*
>This one came from the kitchen right fucking behind me
>I jump half a foot in the air and turn on my speed
>who cares what's in front of me i'm scurrying along trying to
get to the door
>The creaking is coming from the living room now

>and above me
>and behind me
>The entire house is making noise like it's shifting on its
hinges

>There's still howling coming intermittently from multiple
directions
>I'm in panic mode, fuck everything
>I just get up and barrel for where i think the door is
>that's a wall
>that's another wall
>Doorhandle
>I turn it and get inside and lock it
>my knees just give out and i drop to sitting against the door.
>No fucking regrets
>Banging and wailing now coming from the other rooms in the house
outside
>i'm pretty sure i've just escaped with my life by a sliver
>the creaking in the hallway has completely stopped
>whatever it was, it's outside the door waiting for me.
>in the darkness
>waiting

>i crawl across the room, hands blindly out in front of me
>I'm trying to find the bed
>I can't seem to find anything
>It's like the center of the room is empty
>After what feels like miles i find something round tall and hard
>It's the post at the foot of the bed
>I don't even know how i got over here
>this isn't making any sense
>I just inch my way back up the bed until i'm in the middle
>I get on my knees and start feeling around on the bed, i know
raven should be right here.
>The bed is empty
>As far as i can reach is nothing, its flat, no pillows, no
sleeping girl
>It's also cold, no warmth

>Where the fuck is raven
>Where the fuck is everyone
>I swear to god if she got herself eaten after i saved her ass
i'll never forg-
>*BANG*
>The fucking window of the guest room just up and shatters
>HOLY SHIT
>Faster than you can say scooby doo, i'm in the corner of the
room farthest away from the window
>I've never been so surprised in my life
>I'm close to have never been more terrified in my life
>I'm pretty sure my hair is now white
>I'm pretty sure my pubic hair is now white is how freaked the
fuck out i was.
>There's a flash of light from the shattered window
>I see a silhouette illuminated, sitting up on the empty bed i
just checked.

>NAW MAN
>FUCK THIS
>i'm not going to die like this
>i'm going to attack whatever the fuck this thing is that just
broke in and is going to eat me
>i've got no weapons but my bare fists
>maybe i can grab a shard of glass or something
>I start crawling towards the bed with intent
>KAFUCKINGBOOM
>a fucking explosion just went off outside
>no light at all, but it sounded like a neighbor just detonated
their backyard with TNT
>The entire house is shaking
>The ground is vibrating
>I can hear shards of glass rattling across the room
>I'm all the way back in the corner again
>This isn't going to help, there's a loud dull thump in-front of
me, along with what sounds like all of the blankets and pillows
on the bed falling down.
>It's fucking coming for me holy shit

>I'm holding out my hands and making a cross with my fingers
>I know this wont probably work, but i'm just hoping someone will
take pity on me and make it quick.
>I'm going to make a break for the door maybe
>Its my only chance
>I haven't even got my hands down to flee in terror when the
figure on the ground now makes a sound
>"owww"
>It's a girl's voice
>Not a demon
>Not a timberwolf
>It's raven's voice
>"Holyshitravenyouhavenocluehowgladiamthatyou'renotavampirezomibi
eweretimberwolf"
>I think those are the words i said
>i don't think she understood a single word though
>It's alright because she's not a demon trying to kill me
>Atleast i hope so
>"What... Storybro is that you?" (She uses the childhood nickname
she's had for me for ages)
>I'm sorry anons i can't tell you what it is, but its really cute

>I'm ecstatic, i respond with my nickname for her (Also really
cute)
>You have absolutely no clue how happy i was to not be devoured
by a timberwolf demon at that moment
>I'm fumbling around trying to find her
>Another flash
>The room is lit up
>I can see her for a split second
>She's kneeling at the base of the bed, has a blanket wrapped
around her shoulders, hair illuminated and sticking off in every
which direction for just a second
>It's enough time to start heading in her direction
>KAFUCKINGBOOM
>Holy fucking shit another one
>The fucking room is quaking like atleast a 3.0 earthquake
>My heart can't even take this
>The windows of the house are all rattling
>There's howling and wailing all around us
>I don't even need to find Raven, she finds me.

>I don't remember moving but it happened, we're curled up in the
corner i was hiding in before
>She's got a blanket wrapped around herself and kinda my shoulder
>I've got one arm around her and the other holding myself
together with how many scenarios of brutal horrible death i'm
imagining from all the warzone going on.
>But it's pitch black and she can't see that
>She just waits for the sounds to end and whispers
>little-scared-girl fear in her voice
>"This thunder is terrifying, it hasn't been this loud since i
was little"

>Oh right it's thunder
>[spoiler] It's possible many anons have never experienced a real
strong thunderstorm before[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]It sounds like actual bombs are going off outside, your
entire house shakes, it's terrifying[/spoiler]
>I realize i can hear rain outside
>It probably started somewhere between me being in agonizing
fear, and nearly shitting myself over this fucking house
>It's the wind howling in the eaves too, and the creaking is just
the house shifting along with it.
>b... but the lights
>this doesn't explain even half the spooky shit
>I'm pretty sure there's still fucking demons in the hallway
>"I'm glad you're not scared, i would be way more scared if you
were"
>She squeezes me tighter
>I hope she can't hear how close i am to a heart attack.

>This has been a thing she's done since she was 7 or 8
>I think i was sleeping over at her house for whatever reason,
and it started raining and storming outside
>It wasn't that loud, but she did the puppy-dog eyes and told me
she was scared, so i held her hand until she went to sleep.
>After that, whenever there was a thunderstorm it would be an
excuse for me to come over and comfort her
>It was a good excuse, i don't even think she was that afraid of
thunder, she just enjoyed the company.
>I liked doing it, it made me feel older and stronger than i
really was.
>Made me feel like a real man of the house, could protect someone
>In reality i think i was doing it just as much for myself as i
was for her
>Maybe she was doing it for me too, i don't know.
>Still, we had grown older, it wasn't really a thing we had done
anymore.
>The ironic thing was that i was about a thousand times more
scared this time than she was.
>Man of the house i was.

>With the window wide open and wind blowing in, things were
actually falling off tables and cabinets
>and it was really really cold
>Peppermint soap cold
>The arms i've wrapped around raven are freezing, but i'm
concentrating on not showing any weakness
>I've got to atleast pretend i wasn't fleeing in terror down a
dark hallway from demon drop dogs before i found her
>not that i'm doing a very good job of that, i'm shaking
>I'm not even that scared anymore
>All the thoughts about being dismembered and eaten by demons
kind of went away when raven showed up.
>The human mind plays tricks on you when you're alone

>Shows you things that aren't there, tells you scenarios that
aren't happening.
>*BANG*
>These aren't lightning, there's something else outside making
this noise

>It's the fucking demons trying to get in again, its whatever
broke the window
>This scenario isn't in my head this is real

>Another flash
>Raven preemptively squeezes me, she's got her face pressed into
my shoulder
>The window and the area around it is a mess, there's shattered
glass everywhere
>Papers and other light objects near the window have been flung
to the floor by the wind, some papers are even still airborne.
>I can just make out two tall skinny shadows outside the window
>They quickly move out of sight before the light fades
>There's two loud *BANGS* when they do
>Then the thunder hits
>The house rattles again
>The glass skitters lightly on the floor, tinkling sounds echoing
through the room.
>"It hurts, make it stop"
>This wasn't really a plea, or a request it was just a statement
>I guess she wasn't feeling too good still.

>I tell her we should try to move towards a quieter and warmer
part of the house
>There's no argument
>A light flickers on and off in the distance out of the window,
we can't really see where it was but there's light enough to see
the window again

>There's a shadow there, a giant shadow floating in the middle of
the room
>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
>I'm to my feet and i drag raven with me to the door
>She's still wrapped up in the blanket, i can hear it rustling
>I can hear the rain falling outside and on the roof, the
pitter-patter it's making on the hardwood floor beneath the
window
>I can hear the wailing and screaming the wind is making in the
eves of the house

>We're leaving right now, i'm so done with this silent hill
bullshit going on

>I'm just ready for fog to appear at any moment and have us be
trapped somewhere.
>I unlock the bedroom door and open it and try to see whats in
the hallway
>Its really dark, i think i make out a shape sitting across the
hall by the living room
>Lightning flashes behind me again
>Our bodies prevent it from illuminating whatever the shape is
>But the reflected light bounces off its eyes
>Its glowing red eyes
>I hear a growl
>I slam the door again

>"Please tell me you saw and heard that raven"
>There's genuine panic in my voice
>That was a fucking demon dog i know it.
>She's seen nothing
>She has no clue what i'm talking about
>It's some kind of directed demon ghost i know it now
>I'm the only one who can see it
>I think last time the room lit up i saw a book on the floor, i
lean down and kind of fumble around for it until i find it.
>It's some hardcover novel, perfect
>I tell raven to get ready
>She's not really sure what i mean, but i guess she grips my hand
tighter so we're ready to go
>I throw open the door
>I chuck the book into the living room at the creature
>I don't hear a sound, but i see its a clean hit, the eyes are
gone
>I don't even wait, we're into the dark hallway and running as
fast as we can

>I'm stumbling over everything in my way, i hit my leg on
everything, i'm practically dragging raven as we run
>We hit some door, hard
>I hit it first though, it hurts my shoulder but i can stop raven
from hitting it as hard as i did.
>we open it and hide inside
>It smells like old cigars and musty books
>It's a room i haven't gone in before, but i have no clue what it
is.
>Still can't see anything at all
>We just jam the door closed and huddle up at the base of it
>I'm shivering, somewhat out of pure terror, and the rest out of
cold
>She's not dumb, she notices
>She's sharing the blanket this time
>With a deft movement its wrapped around both of us and we're
sitting side by side
>Our shoulders are touching, which is perfect because my shoulder
was very cold and hers was very warm
>We're just sitting there silently in whatever room we've entered
>Its much quieter than the guest room
>Even still, every time we hear a bang, or a bout of thunder echo
through the neighborhood, >Raven flinches and squeezes me harder.

>We're there for what feels like hours, even though it was maybe
only 10-15 minutes at most.
>It's not a talking moment, we never really talked when there was
thunder
>It's a "I'm scared shitless of these demon dogs" moment.
>I'm straining for any sound i can hear in the house that isn't
the bangs creaks and slams i keep hearing
>Finally i hear one
>Its loud, its a heavy door slamming shut.
>Its from the front of the house

>There's banging, stomping, and it's all getting closer
>There's talking too, it's muffled and low pitch, like someone
possessed by lucifer himself
>Whatever it is, it's stumbling towards us
>And its big, its loud
>Its making huge giant stomping squelching steps down the hallway
>Whatever it is it's real close now
>The door bangs loudly as whatever it is reaches it feet first
>fuckohfuckohfuck
>"Grab the handle" I shout at raven, and we both jump up and hold
the door shut as hard as we can.

>"W... are you two in there? Let me in the flashlights are right
there on a shelf"
>Its birthday's voice, but its low and muffled.
>What the fuck are those footsteps though
>"What are you doing in there?", her voice is all confusion
>Giant god damn footsteps that squelch and squeak
>It can't be birthday, its a demon timberwolf in disguise that's
using Birthday's voice to trick us
>I'm trying to convey this to raven when we're both yanked
forward
>Birthday just kinda effortlessly opened the door when we weren't
resisting
>We both tumble sprawling forward and end up on the floor
>I can't see anything
>I can hear Squeaks and Squelches as the giant-footstepped
timberwolf steps over us and into the room we were in though
>There's rummaging, a bit of crunching and a couple more squeaks
before the demon lets out a muffled "AHA!" and i hear a click

>I'm scrunching my eyes closed, its the end i know it.
>Suddenly i can see my eyelids
>Light?
>I open my eyes to see the demon casting some kind of fire-beam
spell at me
>It's too late for me to dodge, i just close my eyes again, lie
still and wait for the eventual burning inferno

>No damage
>I must have rolled a natural 20
>I open my eyes again

>Its just a flashlight
>She doesn't have a light on herself, but the reflection is
enough to give me an idea of what she looks like.
>Her eyes are lit up in a glare, she's got a hand on her hip, and
i look down
>Galoshes
>Oh

>She doesn't look very happy
>"What were you doing in the office!"
>I take a look over at raven and realize she's still topless, i'm
still topless
>This looks bad
>I'm about to start cashing in my previously earned guilt points
to try to get us out of this
>Raven interrupts
>"I was scared of the thunder, i hid, he found me"
>She's got a terrified tone of voice, i know she's faking but
it's really good
>She's amazing with her voice when she wants to be, or needs to
be.
>Still ouch though, those are some hard hits to take just to get
me out of trouble.
>She admitted she was scared of thunder, hiding again, and that i
was at no fault for any of it
>That's a lot of hits, she still owes me way more though
>Birthday seems to accept this answer, as there would be no way
she would self-depreciate herself more intentionally than just
admitting she was in the room half-naked with me.
>Atleast as far as she knew
>Girl logic

>Birthday grants us her blessing and we're given the ability to
cast the level 1 "Minor Light Spell"
>We can now see what she's wearing
>Giant green sweater jacket with the collar pulled up around her
mouth
>Explains the muffled voice
>Was probably really cold outside with whatever she was doing
>We hear other talking in the kitchen, i guess they had all gone
out walking for some stupid reason
>"Come to the kitchen, we brought pizza"
>I lied, amazing reason, i'm sorry i ever doubted you birthday

>We're on our feet in a flash and ready to head to the kitchen

>Pizza man

>Oh, wait...

>I stop, halfway down the hallway and look into the still dark
living room

>I hold my arm out and stop birthday and Raven

>They're all looking along with me

>"Careful, there's a Grue in there"

>They have absolutely no clue what i'm talking about

>I sure hope i don't have a clue either

>I turn around and back away from the living room slowly, keeping
an eye on it the entire time.

>I'm ready at any moment to shine my flashlight in any direction
it's needed, we would only get one chance.
>I don't think the girls knew what was happening, they just let
me do it.

>After an agonizingly slow trip backwards in fear, we make it to
the kitchen.

>We find Homely, Glasses and Blondie wearing similar getups to
birthday
>Frankly they're all wearing way too much clothes, i'm very sad
as all my previous progress is seemingly gone.
>But then again i didn't exactly expect them to go get pizza in
Bras
>The other girls don't take long to comment on Raven's state of
dress though
>"What, clothes not good enough for you?" - Blondie
>"You weren't doing something DISGUSTING while we were gone were
you?" - Homely
>I tell them to promptly shut the fuck up, since she had just
woken up to the window in the guest bedroom shattering all over
her
>Yeah, i make it far more dramatic than it actually was
>That's my job
>I left out the part of me hiding in the corner almost screaming
like a little girl though
>to my regret, thoughts of eating pizza are dropped and
flashlights are handed out
>I guess i'm too good at my job.
>We group up and head to the haunted guest bedroom

>With a mass of flashlights, the room is rather bright, we can
inspect the damage i guess

>The window is shattered pretty bad, glass is all over the floor,
under the bed and cupboards too.
>The curtains are out and billowing up in the air
>They're pretty long so they're in the middle of the room.
>The wooden shutters outside are making "Bangs" back and forth as
they hit the house and then the window frame
>Looks like the top hinge of one of them snapped off, so it hit
the window at an angle.
>There's still occasional thunder and lightning, but its farther
off in the distance now
>The biggest problem is the rain flooding in to the room and
pooling on the floor in front of the window
>Birthday vanishes out into the hallway and we hear the front
door slam before she appears over at the side of the house
>A little bit of string and elbow work later, she's got the
shutters tied closed, they aren't totally waterproof but it's
better than nothing.
>We throw down some temporary towels and return to the pizza,
birthday joining us back in the kitchen
>She's soaking wet

>So are the other girls, but pizza is deemed more important
>I inspect the treasure trove of delicious they've returned with
>Pepperoni
>Pineapple, Ham, Mushrooms
>Green Peppers, Onions, Sausage
>All Xtra Large, God tier pizza selection
>Plus they brought more drinks and snacks
>We're all over it like hungry hungry teenagers
>Seriously, hippos can't even begin to compete
>In less than 15 minutes, Two and a half of those pizzas are
gone.
>We didn't even sit down, we must have looked a comical sight in
that kitchen
>It's completely dark, just a couple flashlights on the kitchen
island illuminating various corners of the room.
>Two of us shirtless, the rest wearing entire soaking wet
overcoats and rain boots.
>All chowing down on pizza like monsters
>It was delicious, frankly it was just what we all needed after
that day
>specially me, after... well after you know who was sacrificed.

>Sufficiently Pizza'd, we get to the next order of business
>I don't actually know what the next order of business is
>Blondie fixes that problem i was having
>"She's got to put on a shirt or something"
>Her tone was polite, light and nearly singsong as always
>But she was definitely antagonizing raven
>"Oh leave her alone, she's almost as Flat as Storybro"
>This was rude, condescending and arrogant... as always
>When homely says this, Raven shrinks back slightly.
>Maybe everyone else didn't notice but i did.
>What am i saying they're girls of course they noticed.
>The funny part is that i didn't really have any urge to protect
her from it.
>She might have just curled up in my arms, but i wasn't feeling
any softer for what she'd done earlier.
>our grouping up was convenient for my state of fear, that was
all.

>I let homely/blondie poke their fun at raven and i just dove
myself into some soda
>When i came back up for air, raven had her arms crossed
defensively and wasn't looking up.
>Sucks for her i guess
>I bring up the fact that the other four girls are wearing a
liberal amount of soaking wet and probably cold clothes
>About to offer to help when Glasses interjects
>She says they should all take a shower and get warm again and
put on some fresh clothes
>I look at the clock, it's only 7:30, it seemed way later
>It's the middle of school session though, so of course the days
get pitch dark at 6:00.
>I offer to put the pizza away so they can all go get ready for
individual hot showers, and they skitter off taking a flashlight
each
>Blondie doesn't take a flashlight though, she just vanishes into
the still-dark living room
>"Eeek!"
>Oh no
>She's being eaten by a grue
>God damnit blondie

>I rush into the living room with a flashlight
>I know i'm not going to be able to save her but i have to try
>At first i can't even find her
>Then i realize she's over behind the couch at the other entrance
to the room
>She's sitting on her butt on the floor
>She tripped over some book and a teddy bear that were sitting
there
>I was relieved, looks like she was safe
>I help her up and turn around to find raven has followed me,
like a little lost puppy
>She's even wagging her invisible tail, its adorable.
>Blondie vanishes into the darkness again and i wish her luck in
her adventure, realizing I'm going to be alone with Raven for
like 20-30 minutes as they all warm up.
>She realizes the same thing.
>She grabs my hand and pulls herself close
>She places it across her right breast and asks "What do you want
to do while we wait?"
>Its a tease, a carefully planned suggestion she's probably been
scheming for minutes now.
>She wants me to pay attention to her.
>I want none of it.
>I yank my hand away

>I move over to the couch, sit down and throw down the flashlight
so it illuminates the bottom half of my body
>its just the way it ends up sitting
>I'm casting a shadow like the reverse of someone trying to tell
spooky campfire stories
>Raven doesn't seem to get the hint,
>She sits down next to me, trying to get as much body contact as
possible
>She doesn't realize why i don't want to sit next to her, why i
don't want to touch her

>I get up and leave her there on the couch, moving to the
armchair.
>Only enough room for one
>I can't see her face, no expressions, just darkness
>She gets up and walks over to me again
>She better not
>She does
>She tries to sit down on my lap
>I shove her off
>Not just a light shove either, she drops two feet to the floor
>She's not getting the picture
>I stand up
>Three words
>"We're. Not. Friends"
>I walk over and pick up the only flashlight in the room on the
couch
>I'm stone cold serious, my heart is dead on making this clear.
>I follow my previous statement with another
>"You don't deserve me as a friend. Not anymore."
>I switch off the flashlight and walk away, leaving her in
complete darkness.
>I just hear silence, silence and my footsteps.

>Then she was eaten by a Grue.
