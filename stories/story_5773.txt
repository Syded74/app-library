Violet hated her name.

It wasn't the name itself that was the problem but the 
fact that it had encouraged both her parents to refer to
her ad nauseam as "their little petal".

The joke had worn very thin well before her fourteenth 
birthday.

She had then taken to using the contraction "Vi" and this 
had been alright until a boy in her class had connected 
her name on a notebook to a recent maths lesson on Roman 
Numerals.

He had pointed it out to a number of classmates and then 
asked her, "Does that make you 'sixy'?"  He knew that his 
New Zealand accent would complete the double pun.

For the uninformed "sex" for a New Zealander is the 
number that comes between five and seven.  And I don't 
mean that the age of consent there is 6 - a sheep that 
old is well past its prime!

At 14, Violet's body was changing and she was changing 
with it.  Her menses had started soon after her 13th 
birthday and had still to settle down to a predictable 
pattern which would mean she wasn't permanently hauling 
pads around with her, "just in case".

As her body began remodelling itself her attitudes and 
interests also changed.  The boys in her class were all 
dorks but there was a teacher who was cute and some of 
the older boys looked interesting; Leo was a hunk, Brad 
was gorgeous and any number of others stirred her budding 
interests.

She found her body reacting when she thought about a 
dreamy male.  Once or twice she had had to make a hasty 
inspection of her panties but found the stains were clear 
rather than red.  "Odd", she thought until some friends 
told her a little more than was considered appropriate in 
the Health and Hygiene (Girls Only!) lessons at her rural 
high school.

Taking heed of their generally correct information, 
Violet started exploring.  She started exploring her 
sexuality.

-----

It was an interesting expedition.  Starting North of the 
Equator she found a region of active mountain building.

The Earth was being pushed up by mysterious forces 
underneath.  It was a slow process yet if one returned 
from time to time one could see obvious signs of nature 
in action.

Violet did a little mountain climbing.  She dug her 
fingers in as she scaled the smooth boulders, working her 
way towards the summits where she marvelled at the cairns 
erected there.

South of the Equator she passed through an area of 
reafforestation, the new growth still a little sparse but 
showing promise of becoming a wilderness paradise.

She considered southwards descending into a gorge.  Like 
the Great Rift Valley in East Africa, a great divide was 
to be found where two leg-like continents were spreading 
apart.

The wide treeless mounds on either side of the gorge
contained folded layers of rock where Violet wandered
until she discovered the entrance to a wondrous cave.

She became a spelunker, boldly going where no man had 
ever gone before, delving into the dark cavern and 
seeking out its hidden charms.

She found a spring and somewhat noisily took the time to 
splash about.  Returning to the surface she left a damp 
trail behind as she traversed the gorge looking for a 
place to set up camp.

Violet took great pleasure in covering every spot in the 
gorge in that quest and returned frequently to the cave
to refresh both her spirits and supplies.

She finally found the perfect spot to camp; a little rise 
not far from the forest where she could look down along 
the length of the gorge.

It made her so happy to be there that she felt she could
stay forever.  In fact she was so excited by the find she
failed to notice the signs of an impending earthquake.

The tremors built up and Violet was sure a volcano must 
have exploded.  (She was wrong though and didn't get to 
see an active volcano until a much, much later 
expedition.)

The tremors passed through the whole of the Earth, even 
causing the mountains North of the Equator to shake, they 
were that strong.

By the gorge, Violet regretfully felt that the expedition 
should leave the campsite lest further tremors cause her 
to cry out in the still night, drawing rescuers who may 
force her to abandon her expedition altogether.

She returned to the cave which she found hadn't been
damaged by the earthquake.  In fact the spring seemed to
flow stronger than ever.

Ever the inquiring scientist, Violet sent some of the 
spring water back to her head base for analysis.  The 
report came back that the sample was clear and pure, 
eminently palatable and somewhat refreshing.  They asked 
for more samples and she took the time to provide as much 
as she could.

With Headquarters satisfied, at least temporarily, Violet 
led her team even further South.  She wanted to get to the 
bottom of the world!

As she neared the South Pole she didn't find the masses 
of cold ice she had been led to expect from her Geography 
lessons.  Instead there was evidence of a meteor strike 
or similar, leaving only a crater in the middle of a 
wide, treeless expanse.

It was Siberia 1908 all over again.

Violet carefully explored the rim of the crater.  She 
enjoyed the trip around it and began to consider what it 
would be like to descend into it.  She made a brief 
endeavour but found herself parched after the long trip.

What to do?  She didn't want to call a halt just yet - 
there was so much more to discover.

Headquarters had praised the spring water; maybe it could 
be refreshing here too.

Violet sent a couple of her team members to retrieve an 
adequate supply.  It took a couple of trips before she 
was satisfied enough to make a second attempt to conquer 
the crater.

Why, you may ask, did she want to go into such an 
inhospitable place?  Her reply would have been that of 
all great explorers, "Because it was there!"

Violet prepared a probe and began carefully drilling in 
the middle of the crater.  Finding the situation was 
neither unpleasant nor damaging to the environment Violet 
drilled a little further.  With success she grew bolder 
and the probe descended into the bowels of the Earth.

Wanting to maximise the results her investigations could
produce in the time available she sent a second team back
to continue exploring the cave.  Getting them to set up
camp in the same location she had used previously, Violet
then had them travel frequently between the lookout and
the cave.

She hoped their efforts would allow her to study the 
effects of another earthquake as soon as possible.

When the probe reached what Violet considered to be its 
maximum depth she began to turn it about, exploring the 
nature of its surroundings.

Information from the probe itself was combined with that 
detected from the walls of the shaft she had opened up 
and Violet was very happy with the results, almost as 
happy as when she had first set up camp herself.

She started to withdraw the probe but, with a woman's 
prerogative, changed her mind and returned it to its 
former depth.  She used that prerogative over and over, 
raising and lowering the probe, adjusting its depth as 
she tried to record every impulse it generated.

The other team meanwhile was busy at the campsite.  They 
seemed to be having a party and certainly everyone's 
spirits were soaring.

The members reeled around camp as though drunk, crashing 
into the forest and falling into the cave like mad men, 
or rather mad women since it was an all female team.  
Violet wondered whether she could one day arrange for 
some men to go on the expedition.

Earthquake time again and, realising it was coming,
Violet removed the probe lest it be damaged by the
tremors that seemed even stronger than before.

At least she was ready this time and had a clearer idea
of cause and effect, though her hands were shaking so
much she doubted anyone would be able to read her writing
had she taken notes.

All in all she considered it had been a very successful 
investigation.

The trail travelled was a route she was to become very 
familiar with over the next few months.
