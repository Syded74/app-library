</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">Clarissa
Cresswell had just presented her arguments before Mr Justice
Forbes-Johnson and won her latest case.&nbsp; She was feeling pretty
pleased with herself today. After a difficult first year at the bar she
had become more and more in demand. Her stunning blonde&nbsp; good
looks had been as much a liability as an asset to start with, but a
lucky illness had put her leading counsel in hospital and thrown her in
the deep end in a very complex commercial case which Clarissa had
handled in what all had acknowledged to be a masterly fashion. The
demure blonde lawyer had arrived in a spectacular way and since then
she had never looked back, with solicitors pushing more work at her
than she could handle - and she could handle more work than most, could
the industrious Clarissa!</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">It
was lunchtime and she was dashing across the Strand to pay&nbsp; a
lightning visit to her chambers in the Middle Temple before being back
in court later in the afternoon.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Gee!
Doesn&#8217;t she look cute! I just love that wig, honey! Can I have my
picture taken standing next to you?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">Normally
Clarissa was far too busy to take note of such idiotic comments from
foreign tourists, let alone those from the USA, a part of the world she
had visited once and had no wish to see again as long as she lived. But
this was no ordinary American! Her normally grave, even cold, features
dissolved into a delighted smile whose warmth would have amazed any of
her colleagues had they been looking.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Miranda!
Darling Miranda! I thought I&#8217;d never see you again!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Hi,
Clarrie! Got a kiss for your former buddy?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Have
I ever!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">And
the two kissed in the street in full view of the passing world. A
gowned and bewigged lady barrister embraced a colourfully and scantily
dressed American tourist - it was a hot day in mid May.&nbsp; Clarissa
had not enjoyed a kiss of passion for years. In fact she had not kissed
another human being&nbsp; - even her two boyfriends - with anything
other than a sense of duty since she had said farewell to Miranda seven
years ago.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Better
not overdo this! I have my professional reputation to think of!&#8221; said
Clarissa after an all too brief taste of those well remembered lips.
&#8220;Come to my office. We can talk on the way and then I must get back to
work! I&#8217;m so busy these days, you&#8217;d not believe it!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I
believe it!&#8221; gasped Miranda as she strove to keep up with her. &#8220;You
always were fond of hard work! Same old Clarissa - even down to the
great body! You still get to keep pretty fit!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I
do indeed! But I really don&#8217;t have a second to spare until Saturday,
Miranda! You must come and stay with me for the weekend. I have a
cottage in Hampshire where we can talk over old times and catch up.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;How&#8217;s
Megan these days?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Fine.
She made it to Sergeant and then left the Force to start a family. Very
domesticated these days! One sweet little girl of ten months and
another on the way! And she looks great !&nbsp; Her face still has a
faint scar, but her nose is as good as new - just slightly crooked -
but you&#8217;d never know unless you were looking for it.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I
told you&nbsp; they&#8217;d put things right, Clarissa! We must meet up
again, the three of us. I&#8217;m over here for a few years. I got a post in
Oncology at Guys and start working&nbsp; for real next week.&#8220; </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">Miranda
looked around the Middle Temple, just before going into Clarissa&#8217;s
chambers. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Is
this where you work? It&#8217;s just so lovely here, Clarissa! You&#8217;d never
think this was the middle of a big city! Not like where we first met!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">Later
that night Clarissa went over the events of the day. She recalled
Miranda&#8217;s words. &#8220;Not like where we first met!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-weight: bold;">The
Temple certainly wasn&#8217;t&nbsp; a bit like that white hot inferno
where&nbsp; two attractive young&nbsp; women had first found love
in&nbsp; bleak and pitiless surroundings.</span><br
