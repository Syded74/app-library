The Room Service Fantasy

Cutie could hardly wait, for Alex was going to satisfy her long standing itch
She was going to be exposed to a stranger—not wearing a single stitch
They planned every detail; they wanted it to be just right
For Cutie would be exposed in all her glory on this very night

They pulled up to the hotel and Cutie let out an anxious squeal
For she knew her fantasy was on the verge of becoming real
Alex had to check them in because she was too nervous to speak
Cutie had butterflies in her stomach and her legs suddenly felt weak

They took the elevator up to their room with Cutie studying every employee she saw
She wondered which of these fine fellows would be the one to see her in the raw
As Alex opened up the door he asked her if she was still totally sure
She just nodded as she had an ache and knew exposure was the only cure

They tossed their luggage on the bed and started to unpack
Then Alex snuck up on her and gave her rump a playful smack
She giggled out loud and then decided to give him a kiss to remember
Alex couldn’t believe he’d ever managed to snare such a hot little number

Intertwined they fell back upon the bed which Alex planned later to put to good use
And he whispered softly in Cutie’s ear about all the orgasm’s he planned to induce
Her body trembled slightly just thinking about the delights the evening was sure to bring
For he always made her feel like a queen and tonight she vowed to treat him like a king

Reluctantly they rose, knowing they couldn’t enjoy the thrill
For Alex knew he still had a certain fantasy to fulfill
Looking into her eyes, he could knew she was ready to proceed
He told her to go get ready and he’d satisfy her need

Cutie stood in front of him, teasing him a little before letting her dress fall
If he’d ever before seen such a beautiful sight, his mind could not recall
Her body was simply amazing, so trim and so fit
He knew how lucky a man he was being allowed to sample it

Alex knew she was very proud of it, as she had every right to be
For there was not a single flaw, at least none that he could see
Her nipples were impossibly hard, perhaps looking forward to tonight’s event
And as Cutie turned to leave the room, Alex checked out her rear as she went

With a nervous giggle and a smile on her face she entered the tub
Meanwhile Alex picked up the phone and ordered some grub
The two lovers had prepared themselves for the actions of this day
And what they had planned so carefully for was now underway

As Cutie soaped up her body, the arousal she felt grew
For one of her favorite dreams was about to come true
It took all her willpower not to give into her intense ache
As she wanted wait for the fantasy in which she was about to partake

Cutie stepped out of the shower and wiped off the mirror
The signs of her arousal could not have been clearer
For she was dripping wetness that had nothing to do with her shower
And her little pearl was sticking out proudly between the petals of her flower

She heard a knock on the door and Alex yelled “I’ll be right there”
And that was Cutie’s cue to start drying her hair
Alex opened the door and told the man to bring the food inside
“I’ll just place it on the table” the room service guy replied

After a moment Cutie stepped out with a towel upon her head
With it draped over her face, she started towards the bed
She heard a startled gasp that she knew Alex did not create
And Cutie stopped moving as her heartbeat quickened in rate

She removed the towel from her head, enabling her to see across the room
And standing there she saw a stranger, mesmerized by the sight as you would assume
They each stood staring; it was as though time had frozen still
And the server could not believe his luck as this was quite a thrill

She radiated both sex and grace—with a body oh so fit and lean
The man thought she was the most glorious sight that he’d ever seen
His roving eyes focused upon her perfect little breasts
As he noticed how proudly they adorned her lightly freckled chest

Then his gaze traveled down her exquisite frame to juncture between her thighs
For one could not miss her excited state as her wetness glistened on her prize
Noting that her clit had risen majestically from its protective hood
The man tried to take it all in for as long as he possibly could

Finally Cutie regained her senses and the ability to speak
She gasped and then let out a very high-pitched shriek
Her embarrassment took hold as a blush formed across her cheeks
Then it spread down her chest racing towards her tiny peaks

One hand shot up to her chest for her little boobies it did encase
The other hand went to cover what once was her most private place
She did not understand how she could feel such shame and excitement all at once
But there was not doubt she wanted this as she could smell her musky fragrance

She did not try to run or hide from this strange man
For doing so would ruin their carefully crafted plan
So she just stood there, barely keeping her charms under cover
And out of the corner of her eye she caught a wink from her lover

The man mumbled an apology and slid by Cutie towards the door
Holding the serving try over his lap, trying to hide the tent that he wore
He glanced back only once, to check out her tight, heart-shaped rear
And his fantasy for many nights to come was now perfectly clear

After he left, Alex to shut and locked the door
For he didn’t know if she could stand to take any more
He could see she was trembling, but from fear or lust he could not tell
So he just took her in his powerful arms and held her for a spell

When she calmed down she tried to whisper him thank you
He told her shush, for her there was nothing he would not do
She nearly cried realizing she loved this man oh so very much
For there was nothing in this world she wanted more than his touch

Alex started to say something, but it was her turn to tell him to cease
She led him to the bed—for what good was arousal without the release?
She undressed him slowly, and soon her body began to quiver
For he was standing proud--ready, willing, and able to deliver

The two lovers had experienced love, lust and desire on many a night
But those paled in comparison to the flames of passion they did ignite
Living out her fantasy had given her such energy and drive
And by the end of the night poor Alex was lucky to be alive

Hours later they lay snuggled together drifting off to sleep
It was then Alex thought he heard his lover begin to weep
She looked up at him and said “I had my fantasy; I want you to have yours too”
Alex gazed back into her eyes and replied “I got mine when I found you!”

The next morning an exhausted Cutie was sprawled naked across the plush, king-size bed
She gently caressed her kitty-cat as the events of yesterday were running through her head She had lived out her desires and knew she would never again feel so nervous
That was until she heard the door open up and man announce “Room service!”
