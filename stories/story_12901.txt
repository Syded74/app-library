James flipped through the book he was reading -- a caper by an American novelist -- without paying it much attention.

He was still edgy. Alec had been awake, yes -- but deep down, he was afraid that it was a fluke, a one-off. That Alec wouldn't wake up again. That the brief half-hour was all he would get.

Nearly ten hours had passed. Shouldn't he have woken by now?

How much sleep did he need?

He set the book aside, and went to Alec's side. Stroked his hair back from his face. Alec stirred, and opened his eyes.

"How are you?"

"Hurts," he said. He pushed against the rail. "Thirsty."

"All right. I'll get you some ice." He got a clean cup and went to the freezer. Then he brought it back and slipped it into Alec's hand. "Do you want me to -- "

"Please."

James plucked out a chip of ice, and slipped it between Alec's lips. Let his fingers linger there. Felt the lips curl into a smile. "More?"

"Yes."

He fed Alec another chip of ice. "I've been thinking about how to deal with the aspirin. I could crush it, mix it in with one of the energy gels."

"Well, it could hardly make it taste worse."

"I know you don't like them, Alec, but-- "

"I know. They're good for me." He made a face. "First the energy gel, then some bacon."

"All right." He was glad Alec had decided to be reasonable. He turned on the skillet and laid four strips of bacon inside. Then he crushed the aspirin and poured it into the packet for the energy gel. He squeezed it into Alec's mouth.

"I was wrong," Alec said. "It does taste worse."

"Do you want a fresh one?"

"No. Just get it over with."

James squeezed the rest of the gel into Alec's mouth, and fed him a chip of ice to wash it down. "The next time I go for supplies, I'll get you the chewable kind."

"Please." Alec closed his eyes. "Don't let the bacon burn."

James flipped the bacon, and turned back to Alec. "There. It should be ready in a few minutes."

"Good. Maybe -- "

James took Alec's hand between both of his. "Tell me."

"No. It's not -- it's silly."

"Come on, Alec." He kissed Alec's fingers. "Tell me."

"The bacon's about to burn."

"Lucky for you." He flipped the bacon again. For the next few minutes, he was too busy cooking to question Alec. He blotted the bacon, and brought one strip to Alec. But he pulled it away at the last second. "Tell me," he said.

Alec made a weak grab for the bacon, but James pulled it out of range. "Come on. Tell me."

"Please. James." He closed his eyes.

James felt fear twist in his gut. "Alec -- listen. Have the bacon. I was just -- "

Alec opened his eyes. For a moment, he gazed past James, but then his eyes drifted into focus. James let himself breathe again.

He fed Alec the bacon, and then more ice. "Is there anything else I can get you?"

"No."

"Anything I can do?"

"I would kill for a shower."

Was this what the fuss had been about? It didn't seem silly at all. Just … "I've been trying to figure out how, with no luck. If you can come up with a way, I'll be happy to do the heavy lifting."

"I'll let you know." He closed his eyes.

"Alec -- I'm sorry."

"It's all right." He yawned. "Maybe later you could give me a sponge bath. And -- "

"What?"

"Read to me?"

He blinked, surprised. "What?"

"I like listening to your voice. And -- I'm not tired enough to sleep, but too tired to hold up my end of a conversation. I'm sorry -- "

"Don't be sorry." He kissed Alec on the forehead, and went to pick up the Hiaasen novel from the table. He flipped it back to the beginning, and began to read.

He kept reading, until Alec fell asleep.
