Pure Strip Poker

Chapter 13 The Epilogue

That Friday night, really early Saturday morning, game with Les and 
Linda was the last strip poker game of our first semester. There were 
term papers that had to be finished and we needed to study for final 
exams. That was really just fine with me, because I was beginning to 
worry that every time we went out, we somehow ended up playing 
strip poker. I wanted a relationship with Mary that was not just pure 
strip poker. 

On Saturday night we did go out to that movie, and the subject of strip 
poker never came up. We spent a few romantic hours in my dorm 
room after the movie too, and we had too many other things on our 
minds to even think about strip poker.

On Saturday, when Mary and I final got back to the dorm from Les's 
apartment, everybody in the dorm seemed to have heard about the 
naked girl who streaked the campus the night before. There were all 
kinds of rumors about what had really happened, and some of them 
were even close to right. I readily admitted to Marc, my roommate, 
that I had been there and seen the streak. I was pretty sure I had 
recognized some guys from the dorm there, so I figured there was no 
sense in trying to pretend I hadn't been there.

Beth, Mary's roommate, gave Mary a hard time for staying out all 
night, and generally seemed to be acting really weird. Well more 
weird than normal, but Mary didn't think much of it Saturday. 

Sunday was when the trouble started. I don't know who found the 
pictures first, but late Sunday afternoon Mary called to tell me 
someone had posted pictures of Friday night's streak on a web site. 
One picture I saw clearly showed Kristen and Bob. George was 
behind some people and you couldn't see much of him. There was 
another picture taken from a distance that showed both Mary and I, 
along with almost everyone else. Fortunately for me, I was facing the 
other way, so no one seeing the picture could know it was me. Mary's 
face didn't show either, but you could clearly see her skirt, which 
would identify her to someone who recognized it, like her roommate 
Beth.

I have heard that Kristen was a little upset when she saw the pictures 
on the Internet. Bob was supposed to be angry too. Mary would not 
have been very bothered by it all, except that it was Beth who first 
showed her the pictures on her computer. That was the first thing that 
freaked Mary out. How had Beth found these pictures so quickly on 
the Internet?

Then Beth dropped the real bombshell. Beth had actually been in the 
crowd on campus that Friday night waiting for the streakers. Neither 
Mary or I had seen her, but there were lots of people there, and Beth 
must not of been one of the people that ran out real close to our group 
as we ran past. Not only had Beth been there, she had taken her 
camera and had pictures of the streakers. Mary was really freaked out 
by that revelation. The reason Beth was telling Mary all this was she 
was worried about getting the film developed. She thought she might 
get in trouble for developing a roll of film with pictures of naked 
people on it and wondered if Mary had any idea where to take it to be 
developed.

Mary was sure that Beth had recognized her there Friday night and 
was completely freaked out over the whole experience. I tried to calm 
her down. We were not the ones who were naked Friday night. So 
what if Beth had pictures of us running next to some naked people. 
There is nothing wrong with that.

I know that one flash went off in my face, so somebody probably has 
a picture with my face in it. If that is posted somewhere on the 
Internet, somebody in my home town will probably show it to my 
father, since he is the local minister, and then I will have a little 
explaining to do. I will just tell him the truth. I was out late one Friday 
night and these naked people were running across the campus. I ran 
along next to them to see what was happening, and somebody took the 
picture. Well... that is the truth...sort of. Everything I said was 
technically true. Bill Clinton got away with it, why can't I?

Well, we are leaving on semester break now. I don't know if there 
will be anything worth writing about next semester. I'm sort of hoping 
there won't be. Mary wants to add her own little note, so she will post 
this when she is done.

- Larry

Postscript from Mary

Larry is really a great guy. I feel very lucky to have found him. Yeah, 
he is a little bit of a nerd, but I'm working on that. Larry is a fast 
learner. Boy, look how fast he learned to play poker. Before that first 
game, Larry barely knew the rank of poker hands. He's a fast learner 
at other things too, but you've just read about that.

Anyway, I'm starting to ramble. I wanted to write this little postscript 
for Beth. That's not your real name. Mary and Larry aren't our real 
names either. Larry changed your description enough that no one will 
ever recognize you, but you'll know who you are when you read this. 
How do I know you will read this? I looked on your computer. I know 
I shouldn't have done that, but after you showed me those pictures, I 
just had to see what you were always doing on that computer. Boy, 
those sites you have booked marked. Wow! IndianOutlaw's Stripping 
Naked World, Bryon's Stripped Naked Forum, The Academy of 
Stripping Naked Beach Club, ... How did you find these sites? And all 
those stories you down loaded. I even found all the early chapters of 
Larry's story on your computer. That's how I know you will read this. 
Did you recognize yourself when Larry introduced you into the story 
line in Chapter 7? Probably not. Larry changed your description and 
the facts around so much that it was hard to see that it was suppose to 
be you. After Chapters 11 and 12, you probably figured it out, huh? 
Well now you know for sure. 

Don't take what I said here the wrong way. I don't think there is 
anything wrong with all those stripping sites. I guess by now you 
realize I don't think there is anything wrong with a little good clean 
stripping. It can be lots of fun. You seem to really like those strip 
poker stories too. I can't blame you for that either. I liked reading 
Larry's story too. And I guess you know I like strip poker, at least 
when its played with the right people and everyone has the right 
understanding about what is going to happen afterwards, then strip 
poker is great fun. If strip poker is just a fantasy game for you, then 
enjoy the story. Maybe Larry will write some more next semester. But 
if you would like to try to make that fantasy real, all you have to do is 
ask. I'm sure I can find a nice safe guy you could bring to one of the 
games. I would avoid any of those guys you've been hanging around 
with though. No offense, but I would never play strip poker with 
them. They just look too dangerous. If you don't know anything about 
poker, I can help you out there too. It's really not that hard. Actually, 
there's a lot more luck to it then Larry let's on in his stories. He was 
really just very lucky in that last game that's all.

Well, that is everything I really wanted to say. Since you have already 
read Chapter 12, you now know what Larry and I really did that 
Friday night. See, it wasn't what you thought. Well, I'm not sure what 
you really thought. In any event, Larry and I didn't really do it that 
night. So you didn't have to give me that long lecture about the 
importance of birth control and stuff. I know all about that stuff, and 
the next night when we did really do it, Larry used a condom. I know, 
I know Larry left that part out of the story, and he is going to be 
pissed that I said it here. I mean, he put every other detail of our love 
life into this story, why leave that one out? He's just a little 
embarrassed because...well let's just say, I didn't cum the first time, 
but heck, what girl comes the first time she does it, or the second for 
that matter. Larry was real gentle, but it still hurt a lot. The second 
time we did it last night was better, and it didn't hurt much at all. I 
know it will get better. Larry is such a sweet guy, and he does really 
care how I feel. Even if I never learn to cum when we do it, Larry will 
take care of me. After reading this story, you know all about that. 

Well that's all I have time for right now. I'll see you next semester. 

- Mary
