Kellys Massage: Part 3 The Restraints

Nicole has got me now. Im totally all hers. Shes got my wrists secured in these retractable restraints that are permanently attached to her headboard. Surprisingly, the wrist cuffs are extremely comfortable. A nice cushioned faux-leather feel, with some sort of soft texture so that my wrists wont get sweaty. Ive been restrained before (as you know), but never by anything nearly this sophisticated.

She tells me shes leaving my ankles unsecured for now. I want to be able to watch you squirm your legs around even though youll be helpless to stop me from doing whatever I do to you.

I nervously reply, To watch my legs squirm?

Thats right. Youre going to be so delicious to watch. Ill be torturing you and you wont be able to defend yourself one bit. But your adorable lower body will be writhing and squirming, free as a bird. Oh, I cant wait to see that.

You cant wait?

No, Kelly. I love looking at you. And just the thought of watching you writhe in response to my touch, while youre completely helpless, well, Im just really excited about it. Its sooo what you need.

What I need?

Absolutely.

We pause our exchange. I see her glance at my naked body. I tingle through and through.

I settle into the wrist restraints and stretch my arms out wide. But then I try to pull my arms back a little closer and the restraints wont budge. Im really stretched out pretty far right now. I say, Nicole, whats going on?

She sits next to me and looks into my eyes. Oh, well, you see, Kelly. These restraints are locking, retractable restraints.

Locking, retractable restraints?

She sees me getting nervous and tries to put me at ease. Oh, dont worry. They're safe. Its like the same technology they use in a seatbelt. You can always tighten it, but you cant loosen it until its completely released.

Like a seatbelt?

Thats right. Like a seatbelt.

I wont be able to get loose?

No, Kelly. You wont. Not until I decide to release you.

My nipples are on fire and shes not even touching them.

Until you decide to release me?

Thats right, Kelly. Until I decide to release you. But dont worry. This is all about what you need. I know what you need. And you need to be tightly restrained. Very tightly. Its completely what you need.

She sees how scared I look all of a sudden. My arms are really pulled tight. All I can think of is how exposed my sensitive nipples are. I have zero defense. I could hardly even twist my upper body. And my armpits? If she decided to glide her fingertips over them? Or use an electric toothbrush on my upper sides? My legs would be flailing wildly and I couldnt even writhe my upper body an inch away. Fuck. Fuck!

She strokes my hair gently. Now dont worry. Really, Kelly. Ive set these straps to have a tolerance of one inch. So youll always be able to pull back and have an inch of slack. So nothing should ever be uncomfortable. I dont want you to be uncomfortable.

You dont? I ask, meekly.

No, Kelly. Not uncomfortable. Just completely helpless and vulnerable.

Those words hit me. I feel tingles through my belly and below.

Helpless and vulnerable?

Completely. Helpless and vulnerable. Do you like that?

I say nothing. I swallow. Deeply.

Kelly, I know what you need. You need to be helpless and vulnerable. And thats what youll be. Naked. Tightly restrained. I could do anything I want to you. I could torture you for hours and theres nothing you could do to stop it. Thats what I mean by helpless and vulnerable. Does that make sense?

I nod.

She looks at me. Seriously. Her eyes are so deep. Kelly, you need this. She looks at my stretched out breasts as they spill to the sides of my upper body, pressed nearly flat from the tension, just my insanely sensitive pink nipples protruding out.

I know shes right. I know I need this. Fuck. I really need this.

My hips and legs squirm deeper into the plush bedding. Without wanting Nicole to notice, I test the restraints a bit. I stretch out my right arm, and shes right. It locks even tighter. Ive never had my arms stretched this tight. Usually when Ive been tied up, theres so much slack and give. But not today. Fuck. No. Not today.

Nicole lowers her face toward mine. She touches my cheek lightly with her fingers. Shes really beautiful. I guess I had never noticed. Her skin is so smooth and natural. Her eyes are so deep. Im kind of getting lost in her eyes.

She moves her hands to my wrists.

What are you doing? I ask, wondering if this might be the beginning of the torture that shes been talking about.

She says nothing. She gently but firmly pulls my arms even tighter. I feel the restraints once again lock in this extended position. I squeal a little.

She smiles back, Just making sure youre comfortable.

She puts one hand warmly on my upper chest, and says in a smooth and calming voice, Kelly, this is all about you. I know what you need. Im in tune with you. With your body. With your mind. With your spirit. Youre going to experience something very special today and Im so honored that Ill be able to make it happen for you.

I just nod. She has me in a bit of a trance again.

She reaches to the side and dips her right fingertips in a bit of massage oil in a little ceramic dish. I dont know what shes going to do. Then she brings her oiled fingers to my left nipple and begins caressing. My entire body writhes immediately. The pleasure is intense.

She continues talking to me. Kelly, youre so pretty. I love looking at you. You have a beautiful body. Every single bit of you. Your thighs. Your breasts. Your calves. Your cute little perfect feet. Your pink nipples. Your round shoulders. Everything so smooth. So creamy. So perfect. And so were going to start off easy. Im simply going to kiss you.

I get a little nervous. Im not gay. Im not bi. Ive never even fantasized about a woman before. I partially wake from my nipple-and-restraint-induced trance. Nicole, really. Nothing personal. But Im not a lesbian. Im not even bi-curious. Im just a boring straight person.

She continues to caress my left nipple and moves her other hand to gently stroke my hair.

Dont worry, she tells me. Im not going to kiss you on the mouth unless its what you need. Im going to start at your toes

At the mention of anything to do with my toes, I get nervous. Shes going to kiss my toes? Fuck. I wont be able to take it. Theyre so crazy ticklish.

and Im just going to kiss every inch of you slowly and tenderly. Some parts I might move on quickly from, and others I may linger. Perhaps for a long while. But Ill know exactly what you need. You dont need to say anything. I simply want you to relax. Feel the vulnerability of your arms pulled tightly and restrained. Know that Im looking at every inch of your exposed skin, which I know makes you so nervous but excited at the same time. And I know youre insanely ticklish. But Im not trying to tickle you right now. Im just wanting to kiss you. So dont worry. If it tickles, just respond. Laugh, squirm. Whatever you need to do. Just enjoy it. Enjoy the sensations. And feel my soft lips and tongue as they move across each part of your incredibly smooth and silky and creamy skin. All the way from your toes. And when I eventually get to your mouth, well just see what you need at that point. Trust me. This is all about what you need. I promise.

Our eyes lock for a moment or longer.

Then she tells me, Im going to begin now. And she pulls away from me, crawling down to the foot of the bed. I close my eyes and wait.


Kelly's Massage: Part 4: Kissed by a Girl (Lower Body) 

As I lay there, my arms tightly restrained, I close my eyes. No girl has ever kissed me before. I mean, not like this. On my whole body? Maybe even on my mouth? Sexually? I really dont know what to expect. Do I just close my eyes and pretend its a guy? No. That misses the point. Nicole is wanting to give me something so special. I just need to relax.

She interrupts my thoughts with her first touch.

I feel her tongue on my toes. Oh, wow. So warm. Its been a long time since Ive been touched like that. By anyone. So gentle. Just running her tongue along the groove between my toes and my foot. Holy shit. Wow. It feels better than I thought it might. I want to squirm my arms around, but they are bound so tight. But my hips respond immediately to the touch. And my legs. They tense and release.

I moan.

Nicole pauses just long enough to ask, You like that, Kelly?

I moan again.

I feel her move her tongue down to the sole of my right foot. I flinch like its going to tickle. But it doesnt. It feels so incredibly warm and smooth. I start to writhe. Nicole jumps up into my face. You better control your squirming or Ill have to restrain your lower body too.

Holy fuck. Shes so powerful and so feminine all at the same time. This feels so good. Her soft tongue on every inch of my foot. How does this not tickle? I dont understand. I close my eyes. Theres nothing else I can do.

Then all of a sudden, I feel like my whole body is submerged in a warm bath. I dont know whats going on. I look down. She has taken my big toe in her mouth. Shes sucking my big toe. Like shes blowing my big toe. Holy shit. This is the most amazing thing Ive ever felt. Its like nothing else. I moan.

As shes sucking my big toe, I feel her hands start to caress my calf up to my knees. My squirming must be out of control. Her mouth on my big toe. I cant even describe.

Then she pulls off. I feel something slippery and warm being rubbed over both my legs. All the way from my toes to my upper thighs.

Whats going on? I ask.

Massage oil. Edible massage oil. To make my kisses even softer and sweeter for you.

I come out of it just enough to say, Nicole, Im not gay. Okay?

She assures me. This is not about being gay. This is about being in tune with your body. This is exactly what you need. I promise.

The kisses begin. First on the top of my foot. Good heavens. Nobody has ever kissed me on the top of my foot before. Ive been tickled and teased. Tormented. But never kissed so lovingly and gently on the top of my foot. Wow. Nicoles mouth. And tongue. And lips. I dont think Ill be able to take it. Is this the torture she was speaking of? I mean, sign me up for this kind of torture any day. My privates are totally on fire. And shes just kissing the top of my foot. I want so badly to touch myself. To get off while shes kissing me. I know she would say no, though. So I dont even ask. I try to relax and just give over to the sensation.

She brings my legs and feet together and straddles my legs, facing down toward my feet.

I told you, Kelly. If you kept squirming around, Id need to restrain you a bit. So Im going to sit on your thighs as I kiss you. This should keep you from writhing around so much.

Shes just in her panties and I feel her warm thighs against mine. I keep telling myself, Kelly, you are not a lesbian. Kelly, you are not a lesbian. I mean, Im not. But Ill admit, this feels awfully good. And her smooth legs against mine. Ive always told myself that I prefer manly, hairy legs. And I do like that. But fuck. Theres something about this thats awfully nice.

Shes kissing her way up my legs and calves. She takes her time. Ive never had someone take their time like this before. I think shes right. This is exactly what I need. And she knows exactly what shes doing. Fuck. Her lips and tongue are so smooth against my legs. The oil helps. But even without the oil, just the feeling of her lips touching, kissing, pulling away, touching, kissing, pulling away. So caring. No. Ive never felt something like this before. And the arm restraints. I dont know why. But being pulled so tight like this? Fuck. I feel so helpless and vulnerable. Just like she said. And I never want it to end.

Nicole repositions. Shes getting to my thighs. Im so insanely ticklish there. Especially on the inner thigh. I tense up. She feels me tense up.

Kelly. Breath. Deeply. In. Out. Deep. Shhhh. Shhhh... She rubs my thighs with deep pressure. Against the oil, her hands glide along the insides and outsides of my thighs. It feels so warm. I feel so safe. It doesnt tickle at all. Not at all. What is this magic shes working? How is she doing it?

Im so incredibly horny. Its not even funny.

Then all touching stops. I cant even open my eyes. My arms pulled tight. Barely even able to move. Not that I would move if I could. It suddenly hits me why I like being restrained. No control. No power. Give over everything. All for me. Nothing I can do. Its a little selfish. I never thought of it as selfish to be tied up. Until this moment. Completely at Nicoles mercy. So tight.

I feel her hands gently spread my legs apart. Far apart. Not uncomfortably so, but very wide.

I keep my eyes closed.

I feel her kisses on my oiled thighs. Mostly on the inside. It does tickle a little. Im so sensitive there. I squirm. She says nothing. She keeps kissing. A moment on the right. A moment on the left. Shes working up. Slowly. Working up. Inch by inch. Kiss by kiss.

Holy shit. It occurs to me where shes headed. Why didnt I realize it before? Kissing every inch of me? This isnt right. Im not a lesbian. Im really not. Ive never once fantasized about a girl. Honest. Never once. Ever. Didnt even occur to me. But here I am. About to be touched. There. By a woman. And Im not saying anything to stop it. Fuck. I want it. I want to know what a womans tongue feels like. Her lips on mine. I wouldnt stop it if I could. Which I cant anyway. But fuck. Fuck!

I feel the top of her head between my legs. Her kisses. So soft and perfect. Alternating from right thigh to left thigh. Inner. So incredibly inner.

Then I feel nothing. She has pulled away. Curiosity gets to me. I open my eyes and peer down. She lifts her head and looks at me.

Close your eyes, Kelly. Close your eyes. This is exactly what you need.

Fuck, it is. It sure the hell is exactly what I need. How is this woman so in tune with what I need???

I wait. I wait. An instant turns into a moment. I feel her fingers caressing my belly. Smooth. No oil there. Just her fingertips on my tender skin. So light. I squirm to the best of my ability. It hasnt occurred to me until this instant how freeing it is to be restrained. Holy shit.

I wait.

I wait.

Again, seconds. Moments. Forever.

And then it happens. My entire being is filled with warmth. So small. So incredibly small. The tip of the tongue. But it feels like everything. The sun and moon and stars. The entire cosmos. Nicoles tongue on my lips. The lightest pressure. But oh, wow. So exactly what I needed. I dont even remember that shes a woman. It has nothing to do with anything. How long has it been? It doesnt matter. I dont even know whats happening. I moan. I squirm. I push into her. She pushes back. Just the tiniest tip of her tongue. As tight as my arms are pulled, I want them pulled tighter. I stretch as far wide as I can, knowing the restraints will lock further. I want her to restrain my ankles too. I wish I couldnt move a muscle. But at the same time, Im happy to squirm and writhe. Oh, fuck. I say it out loud. Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck. I trail off. Her tongue dances circles around me. Its a teasing motion, but I dont even care. Its contact. Holy fuck. Contact!

Out loud again. Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

She pulls up. I told you this is what you needed.

Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck. Please

Please what?

Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

She knows what I need.

Light. Tongue. Teasing. Around the lips. Never making contact with the inside. Never making contact with my clit.

After a moment, the newness subsides and the desire increases. I need more. Something deeper. Something harder. Something to satisfy me.

I cry out, Please

She continues to make teasing circles with her tongue. Kissing my lips on one side, then kissing them on the other. Lips and tongue. Back and forth.

Please My arms are completely immobile. Please I try to writhe my pelvis up, deeper into her mouth. She pulls back. Just the tip of her tongue.

Fuck! Fuck! FFFUUUUCCKK!!!

She pulls up. She gets in my face. I warned you, Kelly. I warned you. Im going to torture you for as long as I want.

Come on please

She kisses me softly on the cheek and descends again.

Please how much longer?

Not even removing her tongue from my lips, the lightness of her touch starting to make me insane, she says, As. Long. As. I. Want.

FUCK!!! FUCK!!! PLEASE!!!

Suddenly, my nipples ignite. I look. She has reached both arms up. Her head buried between my legs, her tongue teasing my lips, her oil-drenched fingers are teasing my nipples.

COME ON PLEASE.

No response. Just continued, light, grazing, teasing torture.

Fuck. FUCK! FUUCCCKK!!!

I settle in. Theres nothing else to do. My pelvis and legs and feet are writhing. My arms immobile. My chest heaving and twisting as best as it can.

Holy fuck. Sweet torture.

This is exactly what I need. Fuck. Please let it never end.
