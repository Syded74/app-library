Hangs Around</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="+2"><span
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s
beginning to work, Miranda!&#8221; </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Maybe,
but I still don&#8217;t fancy running hour after hour in this heat! But
you&#8217;re right about getting the feet hardened up. It hurt the first few
days, but as you say, it&#8217;s beginning to work.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">It was
three weeks since Megan and Clarissa had been&nbsp; falsely imprisoned
by the local police in this desert gaol. Megan still hung in her cage
and seemed to be surviving. Clarissa had seen her a couple of times at
night, being let out and exercised by a friendly guard. She wondered if
this woman might ever be of help to them in an escape attempt, but when
Miranda had been asked, the idea had been well and truly scotched.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;They&#8217;d
all be in prison if the outside world heard about this place. They may
be nicer than the others but they know what side their bread&#8217;s
buttered. We have to rely on ourselves alone, Clarissa. Us and Megan if
they ever let her out!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">Clarissa
and Miranda were inseparable by this time and Megan noticed, from her
high vantage point, just how affectionate the couple were becoming. At
first it had saddened her to think she was losing Clarissa, but as time
went by she was just grateful that her friend was being looked after
and seemed to be happy enough considering her circumstances. It hurt
her that Clarissa never looked up at her, but she hardly thought that
this was deliberate callousness on her friend&#8217;s part.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">Megan&#8217;s
face still bore the marks of her rough treatment after her attempt to
protect Clarissa. Her nose had been smashed twice by the blows of the
guard&#8217;s rifle butt and there was a scar across her forehead, which she
could feel whenever she touched herself there. After five days a
friendly guard who had fed her had let her out for a few minutes and
helped her clean herself up. As Miranda had said, her first full day
had been the worst. She had made the mistake of moving around too much
and had quickly leaned that it was essential to conserve one&#8217;s strength
during the day as the heat beat down with such terrifying force. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">The two
girls had known that it was hot in this part of the world but this was
the first time they had both, in their different ways, been exposed all
day to the hundred plus degree inferno. During her first week, she had
burned in the fierce sun but her skin was now almost black and proof
against the worst the sun had to throw at it.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">Her
worst fear was that if and when she was let out of this cage, whose
discomfort was still almost impossible to bear, she might be
permanently deformed from being forced day after day to be in this
crouching position. It had been five days before she had been let out
for a short time and another seven days before the same friendly guard
had been on duty again. Since then she had not been freed&nbsp; once
and despair was beginning to set in.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;How
much longer will they keep Megan up there, do you think?&#8221; Clarissa
asked Miranda during the first break. They had finished eating and
drinking and were stamping on a few sharp stones to keep the soles of
their feet in their newly hardened state and even get them thicker that
ever.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t
know. The last woman to be put in there was in for seven weeks. Before
that, there was one in the cage for eight. And the only other person I
ever saw up there was in for four weeks and then transferred to an
inside solitary cell where she still is after more than a year. But
they had all been previous offenders. Megan is only a first time
offender. I think she should be out within the next couple of weeks.
But don&#8216;t bank on it, Clarissa!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;If we
have to wait for her to be freed and then become as fit as we are, that
could mean&nbsp; three more months before we make a break for it.
That&#8217;s almost four months we&#8217;ll have been here and we both have careers
to be starting, Miranda. We&#8217;re wasting away the most important time of
our lives.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">Miranda,
too, was a young woman on the verge of a career. She had been due to go
to a medical school three years earlier before being seized in a
similar manner to Megan and Clarissa. Unfortunately she had not left
word of her whereabouts before setting off on her lone tour and had no
idea whether or not her relatives were still looking for her. Both her
parents were dead and the aunt who was her nearest relative had never
welcomed the responsibility of looking after her deceased brother&#8217;s
child. As Miranda had grown into a woman, and a woman with a decided
sensual preference for her own sex, her aunt had just about washed her
hands of her.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">The
whistle went to announce that the break was over. Clarissa and Miranda
kissed each other on the mouth and took up their pick-axes, resuming
the pulverisation of rock which took up all their long working day.
There was a cheer from the other women to see the kiss. Clarissa was a
lovely girl and Miranda tall and handsome, strongly built and with more
than a hint of masculinity. They made a striking couple and all could
see how utterly infatuated Miranda was with the smaller girl, who
clearly returned her affection, at least in part.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">Two more
weeks passed and Clarissa pronounced her own feet well and truly up to
the task of getting rapidly out of sight of the prison, especially if
they could escape not too long before dark. One problem was the need to
travel quickly. Miranda was sure she would be out of breath after only
a few miles.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;If we
run around the compound in the exercise period, they might suspect we
were planning to make a break. But running on the spot in the cell!
That could be the answer! But Stella would need to be told.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">Stella
was the odd woman out in the cell. Both Clarissa and Miranda had
offered to include her in a sort of lesbian threesome, but she had
angrily refused. And it was clear that she did not approve of her
companions&#8217; increasingly uninhibited love-making. Only last night,
Clarissa had&nbsp; momentarily raised her head from her attentions to
Miranda&#8217;s succulent cunt, as her lover had spread wide her long and
beefy legs to allow the blonde head access to her sex, and seen the
look of disgust on her cellmate&#8217;s face. Despite this, they were both
convinced that Stella would not betray them, for she hated the prison
and her continued incarceration far too much for that. </span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;What
are we to do, if they keep Megan up there for ever?&#8221; asked Miranda as
they toiled away side by side. &#8220;If we leave without her, they may take
it out on her. But I am beginning to think she&#8217;s become a permanent
fixture in that cage. It&#8217;s that fucking cunt Debbie! She really took a
king-sized dislike to poor old Megan! If Megan stays in the cage,
she&#8217;ll cooperate with the screws and make her girls do the same. I&#8217;ll
have to have a word with her and see if I can&#8217;t persuade her to agree
to freeing Megan. But if one of us can get a message to the State
capital and let them know all about this place, she will be freed then,
along with a lot of the rest of us. We can&#8217;t wait much longer, Clarrie!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I know,
but I hate to leave her, all the same! It seems a betrayal.&#8221; Clarissa
felt herself starting to cry and she said no more until they were on
their way back to prison. She looked up at her friend for the first
time in weeks and was shocked at how the long captivity had affected
her. There seemed to be no fight left in her after all this time. She
would clearly be in no shape to take part in an escape for weeks after
her release, and that seemed as far off as ever.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">That
night the humane guard was charged with feeding Megan. As was usually
the case with her, she let the captive out to walk about and straighten
up. This time Megan spoke to the friendly guard, risking punishment,
but desperate to make contact with another human after so long.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;How
much longer am I going&nbsp; to kept here? I don&#8217;t think I can take a
lot more of it. Sometimes during the day, I just want to let myself
die. We neither of us did anything wrong, you know. I swear we are both
innocent!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">The
guard explained how the town she lived in had been settled by a strict
Protestant sect about one hundred years ago and that over the past ten
years the elders had become more and more strict. Wayward women were a
particular object of their punitive zeal and, in their eyes,&nbsp; lone
women travellers came under this heading, especially if they were
immodestly dressed. She, herself hated everything about the system but
had family in the town who would suffer if she went against the elders
who dominated this remote county. The woman pointed north west and said
that&nbsp; the nearest way out of the elders&#8217; jurisdiction was twenty
five miles, where there was a filling station&nbsp; together with a
public telephone.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;But you
could never make it in bare feet, and even if you did, in the heat
without water you&#8217;d die before you got ten miles. I don&#8217;t know why I
tell you this, because you&#8217;ll never get the chance, but in case you
ever do, that&#8217;s the direction to take. But it would be hopeless - all
ravines and boulders. Now, I&#8217;m sorry, but you must get back in. I&#8217;ll be
on duty in five days&#8217; time, so it won&#8217;t be too long before you get out
again, Megan. Try to be strong, now!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">When
Clarissa looked slyly up at her friend next morning she was delighted
to see Megan looking more lively.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I think
maybe Megan looks better today!&#8221; she said to&nbsp; Miranda. &#8220;I hope it
lasts.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Me
too!&#8221; said Miranda. &#8220;I sounded out Debbie last night after supper. She
won&#8217;t play! It&#8217;s giving her a real kick thinking Megan is up there at
her pleasure. As far as she&#8217;s concerned, she can stay there for the
next thirty years until they release you both! Not that they ever will
release you, of course. They aren&#8216;t so insane they don&#8217;t know what
would happen if either of you did get out.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Then we
have to get out without her! I hate the idea, but what else can we
do?&nbsp; It should be a full moon in a week. That should help us at
night. We must try to get some kind of bottle to take with us. Unless
it rains sometime. Does it ever rain around here?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Only in
the winter and not always then.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Can it
get cold in winter?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Yes.
Especially at night. Last year they kept us in a couple of times. The
naked prisoners really suffered, especially as some of them are getting
older. One died.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">They got
into the truck and were soon at the site of their back-breaking though
useless work. Soon the air was thick with dust as twenty sweating women
used hammer and pickaxe to reduce more rocks to rubble.</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: times new roman; font-weight: bold;">&#8220;We
could bury a bottle in all this stuff, said Clarissa as they took their
short break. She dug into the dust with her pretty but dirty foot. &#8220;It
must be quite deep. If we could only get hold of a bottle, it wouldn&#8217;t
be too hard to conceal it. They never search us.&#8221;</span><br
