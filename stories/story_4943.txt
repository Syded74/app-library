CHAPTER THREE

THE MERRY BUNCH IS GETTING LARGER

My own Twin-Sister is pregnant. By Me. I am going to be 
a Father. A Father at 14!!

Not like we were putting our wild, erotic Funs at hold, 
or anything  ho, quite the contrary in fact!! The baby 
needs to be well-nutritioned  and what can possibly 
be better for him  or her  than the raw flesh of 
other babies?

And, if you ask Nogah and myself  Adrenalin flows, 
are just as good as Mozart So

Of course, do not let you mistake here  we do also 
enjoy greatly, eating parts of the babies' mothers  
or big sisters, in case of such Nogah claimed to have 
foreseen, that eating <> is best, for supplying 
some of the most vital nutritional needs of young 
pregnantees, just as well, as eating testicles would be 
good for me, if only I'd cut my foolish objection to 
do so and start "eating like a man!", now that I am 
about to become a Father. But

Eating those testicles, for me, reminded, far too much, 
of having licking them  and

The pain was still present, very, very bad. And very, 
very harsh. Heart smashing.

But soon, however, many things were about to be changed. 
A greatest change, was right about to rain itself upon 
us both  and all for the Best:

We were hunting pedestrians, for what had seemed 
to be the zilionth time or so, when  right after Nogah 
had remarked, it was starting to get boring  when 
suddenly, we've noticed a Romantic cupple about 
our age, or just a slightly bit older, walking on 
the sidewalk, hand-in-hand, holding and kissing 
one another.

We have killed many such cupples. We do most 
oftenly take a most special pleasure at that; as, 
after all, did THEY tried to kill US, for Loving 
each other?

But, Nogah's remark had made me thinking. I pulled 
aside and asked her, winking slightly, jockingly, "so 
hey, what d'ya think  perhaps we'll try to see, whether 
or not they could be able to join our Life?"

Nogah had stared at me; what was I talking about? We 
have NEVER done such a thing!! It was us, the two 
of us, against all the entirity of the rest of the Globe; 
THAT simple.

But then, she shrugged, and just ever-so-lightly smiling, 
and slighly winking at me, she said, "well  why not; 
IF they could take it otherwise, they dead".

I had been thinking just simiarily.

So, I started the engine again, drove a little and pulled 
aside next to them.

I have immediately noticed they were crying, both 
of them; and frightened. What have those monsters 
DONE to them??

You see, after you've been chased and hunted, beaten 
and persecuted for quite a long time, you CAN tell, 
once you've met other victims of the same atrocities; 
it is like telling the hair-colour, for us  as easy as 
breathing. And Nogah, of course, had noticed this, too.

"Hey mates! Wanna come up and join our ride?" 
She smiled at them full-Heartedly  and Nogah's Heart 
is ENDLESS, INFINITE.

The Boy shrugged. "Well, why not Would You 
like to, `Idith?" he asked, tenderly and EVER-so-Gently, 
while stroking his GirlFriend's hair lightly, softly and 
caringly. "Y  yes, why not", she swallowed her tears, 
nodded and looked at me.

And then I knew.

From this point on, there shall be the Four of us; our 
days as Two are up.
