	<h1 align="center">My traveling companion</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been planning this long, extended trip to Europe for a long time. Actually ever since julii came to work for me, my interest in this became <i>much</i> more interesting to me. julii came right out of high school and was the picture of innocence. She was so naive and I immediately 	noticed the potential in her. She never seemed to spend time with the other girls, or any particular boys. I sensed in her the type of girl that keeps to herself and could use mentor-ship. I was not about ready to let this one get away.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;She is no more than 5'1 and barely 100 lbs. She has long blond hair, that cascades over her shoulders and vivid, clear blue eyes that seem to take everything in as if it were new to her. She wears little makeup, although more now that I have <i>suggested</i> things to her. She takes so well to suggestions that it just sends a shiver through my body thinking of the posibilities. She was living at home when she started with me, about 6 months ago, although now she has a small condo of her own. I visit her at her condo occasionally and bring her little things to help her decorate.  One night, I asked her why she never had a problem with me visiting her unannounced and why she never had other visitors. Of course, I know the answer to this. She looked at me, blinked her big blue eyes and said in all her naivety "<font color=blue><i>I keep hoping you will visit me.</i></font>" That was so open, honest and so sweet I almost kissed her right there. I mean, can you imagine anything more innocent than that?</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yes you are correct, if you thought that my mentoring her was more than just helping her with work. I was molding her little by little to be someone that was relying on me very much... for everything. She even calls me to ask my opinion about things at all times of day and night. On the phone, we spend very little time and if I am entertaining a visitor or company I will let her know. Then when I am un-busy I will call her back and answer her question whether it is about a shade of lipstick she should wear, or the length of her skirt or to discuss something she saw on TV that her little mind just can't absorb.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first night julii spent at her condo, I came over to visit. I brought bags of groceries for her.  She was dressed in a light blue top, navy shorts and bare feet. How precious!!  I instructed her in how to prepare the light Italian dinner, I was expecting. The dinner was complete with wine and candles. We had a lovely dinner, and julii learned how to set a perfect table and how to server her guest. I looked in her eyes from across the table and said "<font color="red"><i>Thank you for dinner, julii. You are going to make someone a wonderful partner</i></font>", using terminology that gay women around the world are accustomed to hearing. She just sat there, prim and blushed unable to think of anything to say. I <i>suggested</i>i> we 	retire to the sofa and talk a bit. I told her the dishes could wait. She sat down on the end of the sofa, and I sat close enough that she was uncomfortable with the proximity of my body to hers. </p> 
	 
	 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning forward a bit, my arm resting on the back of the sofa, I looked at this wide-eyed beauty. Her innocence was so tempting and  I can nearly smell the heat coming from her. She broke contact with my eyes and dropped her eyes to my chest with my pendant resting between my breasts. We sat there in silence as she just kept looking at my pendant and my hand rested on her shoulder, while she leaned closer to me. I took her hand in mine, as she looked at me in silence. We talked about her upbringing, her family life. I found out she has had trouble with traditional male-female relationships and have been shying away from such. I, of course, validated her decisions to do that, telling her it is often best to just let things like that rest. I rubbed the back of her hand, as I told her I had several problematic relationships with boys back in school, too. Actaully the problem was, all they wanted was to get in my panties and I wanted more from a relationship. "<i><font color="red">julii, women want more from a relationship than some shallow sexual, on and off again thing men seem to feel is intimacy.</font></i>" julii just nodded her consent to accepting what I was telling her. We spent hours there, talking intimately about our experiences and julii found it comforting that I shared some of the same feelings she has.</p>
	 
	 <p>After hours spent solidifying the bond between us. The personal bond, forgetting our relative positions in the company. I told her it was time to do the dishes up and she got up feeling weak and disoriented as I helped her to the sink. I instructed her on how to wash each dish with a thorough thoughfulness, deliberate in her task as I stood right behind her, my body pressing against her back as I leaned over her to help her understand. I could hear a soft purring and her body shivering against me as we did the dishes up right. In effect, I had her tapped to the sink my body pressing against her, my voice soft in her ear as she mindlessly went about cleaning every dish and piece of silverware as if it was the Queen of England requesting her to do this for her. Finally, when she was done cleaning up I took her hand as we walked to the door.  She looked up at me with those big beautiful eyes of hers, as I leaned down to kiss her cheek and tell her that it was bed time. She turned and went in the bedroom as I slipped out the front door. </p>
	 
	 <hr>
	 <p>asked as her head just nodded. "<i><font color="red">I bought it in Brazil from a native woman that told me it has magical qualities</font></i>", I said softly.  I lifted it up with my hand so it was inches from her eyes, as my other hand caressed the back of her shoulder.  "<i><font color="red">Fascinating, magical qualities julii</font></i>", I whispered as she just gazed at the jewel. "<i><font color="red">The woman told me that the innocent cannot take their eyes off it, julii</font></i>", I whispered as her innocent eyes locked on the magical pendant. I had thought the old woman in Brazil was full of it, but I paid way too much for something that I hoped had half the attraction I had hoped for. In fact, when I go to schools to recruit women for working at my company, I <i>always</i>wear it and have amazing successes, like julii here.</p>
	 
	 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<font color="red"><i>Just keep looking at the jewel that came from the deep, dark jungles of Brazil. You are unable to take your eyes off the beautiful jewel, julii</i></font>", I breathed into her ear. "<font color="red"><i>You will not remember this, but the jewel is called the <b>Love jewel of the Amazon</b>. Each person that looks at it, opens themselves up for a deep love that burns within their heart and loins</i></font>", I informed her sub-conscious. That little nugget of truth brought her to a moaning and squirming attitude toward me. She was falling in love with me, from that very moment on.</p>
