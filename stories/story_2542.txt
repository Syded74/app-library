>When we left off i was locked in the bathroom with angry women
possibly beating down the door
>No time traveling anons came to my rescue
>Jerks
>I had to solve this one on my own at the time.
>I was in a pretty great mood though, since i had just made out
with every currently conscious girl in the house, in a span of 10
minutes.
>Of course the banging and yelling outside the bathroom wasn't
helping my mood
>"Come out so we can castrate you" - Blondie
>This was accompanied by hurried agreements and more banging.
>There goes my thoughtful assassin thinking ahead as always.

>Far as i saw it, they weren't actually too angry.
>[spoiler]Women especially, tend to pull this very often compared
to men, where they'll get Angry, or overreact to a subject that
they aren't actually as emotionally vested towards as they make
out to be[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]This seems to be for partially entertainment reasons,
and partially because faking strong emotions gives you control
over the situation[/spoiler]
>[spoiler] Manipulation and Advantages in future situations
really[/spoiler]
>[spoiler] This isn't rare among men either, but men are usually
being complete faggots about it when they do.[/spoiler]
>[spoiler] Oh right, i guess the women are being complete faggots
too[/spoiler]
>But they were angry enough that hiding in the bathroom was a
valid option
>so i guess they were winning.

>As far as i was concerned though i had them right where i wanted
them
>Each one was now playing the words i had sung to them earlier
over and over in their own head.

>About being the cutest, most intelligent, most beautiful, the
most desirable in the room.
>Each girl had the vain hope that it was them i was talking
about.
>Each girl was probably replaying the kisses over and over along
with those words too.
>I'm no casanova, but i mean i tried to not make the kisses
awful.
>I know i was playing my favorite in my head at least.
>[spoiler]I'll give you a hint, it wasn't homely[/spoiler]
>However i had other things to do than reminisce about my past
>Time to defuse this situation.

>I walked up to the bathroom door and pressed my head against it
facing the door crack.
>I wanted them to be able to hear my clearly
>They were still shouting various angry things and banging on the
door though
>"WhO WAS IT?" - Homely
>"You Tasted like all the other girls, i want a rematch!" -
Birthday
>The vibrations of the banging resonated through the door and
were giving me a cheek massage.
>I think i was enjoying this.
>"He's probably jacking off" - Glasses
>I spit my drink all over myself at this comment
>except i don't have any drinks and i'm up against the door, but
i mean that's the reaction anyway.
>The girls on the other side of the door devolve into hooting,
giggling and more banging.
>"Open up! Let us see!" Squeaks an exasperated Birthday.
>"He's embarrassed now, we should let him finish" - Blondie in a
taunting singsong voice.
>Blondie's spirits are way higher than i would have thought, i
thought i crushed her a bit too hard when i kissed glasses first.
>She probably couldn't be anything but happy when i went straight
to her second.
>"He probably needs help" - Glasses
>Yes pls
>"I bet its small that's why"
>A chorus of giggling and snickering ensue from
Blondie/Birthday/Homely instantly.
>I don't even need to tell you who said this
>BUT FUCK YOU TOO HOMELY

>Glasses has done wonderfully though
>She successfully changed the situation from "CASTRATE HIM"
anger.
>To sexual humiliation and teasing

>Glasses is such a bro
>You might not think so

>But I can work with this
>It's almost safe to come out
>I speak as clearly through the door as i can
>"Stop" , i say it softly but loud enough that they can hear it.
>One word, but the banging stops and they listen for the rest.
>I put on a completely Somber tone, trying to interject the
tiniest hint of emotional sorrow into what i say next.
>"You guys will wake Raven"
>Silence from the other side of the door
>I continue
>"One of you go check on her would you..."
>Complete silence on the other side of the door
>Eventually i hear footsteps leaving
>My plan has worked perfectly.

>Firstly i've interjected guilt into the mix, they realize they
were being really loud and feel guilty about it.
>I honestly couldn't give a shit about waking raven, and i really
doubt they would have woken her.
>But they don't know that.
>This throws them just a bit off balance
>Just enough for me to ask for one of them to leave
>I've changed the odds
>its 3v1 now, i can take this.
>I speak again through the door
>"I'm coming out"
>Still silence
>I unlock the door
>Its not instantly shoved down and i'm not on the floor
>I consider this a victory
>Gotta take em when i can get em.
>I know i gotta keep the victories coming though
>I crouch down and start charging
>FAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL
>I open the door when i'm half charged.
>First target is blondie, perfect.

>She gets hit hard in the stomach with the Force of a thousand
screeching fal"CON"s that accompany my "PUNCH"
>Homely and Birthday are the only two left.
>It's still dawning on them that i'm out of the bathroom
>They don't understand yet
>I still have the advantage
>I give Homely an ol Sagat tiger knee to the stomach
>She doesn't even block
>Her feet even leave the ground for a moment
>She's down
>Birthday Vs Me now
>But she's onto my plan
>I try to catch her off guard with a generic Karate chop to the
right shoulder.
>I know that if i can disable one arm i can win.
>She dodges to the left and i'm left open.
>She hits me with some god damn lightning legs like chun li
>I guess she doesn't need her arms
>Atleast 10 hits before i fall backwards.
>I'm on the ground clutching my stomach
>She moves over to gloat, hand on her hips
>I was just pretending
>DRAGON UPPERCUT
>She's in the air
>She's on the floor
>I win.

>I walk in victory to the living room
>The girls follow me
>Blondie has her hands on her hips in characteristic "You have
some splainin to do mister" style
>Birthday and Homely mimic her in seconds.
>I try to avoid them and sit on the couch
>Homely stops me
>"Oh no you aint goin nowhere"
>She even matches this with her hand going in that "Z" motion and
snapping her finger at every corner
>They surround me
>Birthday places her hand on my chest for a tantalizing second
before shoving me down onto the armchair.
>They're all towering over me, hands on hips.
>I'm being glared at from all directions.
>This is when i realize all of the women were black.

>And Blue with jealousy

white kids[/spoiler]

kinda picked up silly things and did them sometimes[/spoiler]

>[spoiler] white culture is never cool anyway ): [/spoiler]
>They were demanding answers though
>Glasses shows up as well, she just plops down on the right arm
of the chair and accompanies the staring contest.
>I'm considering staring back, but picking one girl to look at
might give away hints i can't afford to be giving.

>I'm trying to think ways out of this, i already laid most of my
webbing before i started kissing.
>I guess i have an escape route or two
>I test one of the webs
>"Well, I just thought that the girl would know is all."
>Expressions soften all around, i've now got four sets of cute
puppy/kitty cat eyes glimmering at me.
>God damn adorable, i've got this
>They'll all shut up and think its themselves.
>I continue
>"I tried to make the kiss between us Special..."
>All the kisses were "Special"
>I had kissed all the girls differently, even if they compared
they could argue about it for hours.
>This plan was flawless, i just had to walk away.

>a soft voice breaks out over all the others.
>"I knew it was me"
>NO

>YOU IDIOT
>BLONDIE YOU FUCKING IDIOT
>ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS NOT SAY ANYTHING
>She's got a smirk on the size of kansas though
>She knows exactly what she's done

through the city.
>My head on a golden plate
>The girls break into TURBO BICKERING
>"He liked ME the most" - Homely
>I'm trying to sneak away
>"No of course he DIDN'T, i had Butterflies in my stomach when he
kissed me!" - Blondie
>I've gotten on my hands and knees, i've started scaling the left
arm of the chair
>"Well he groped my breasts, he didn't do that to you did he?" -
Birthday
>I'm halfway to freedom when i feel a hand in the waistband of my
pants
>"HE WHAT" -Blondie and Homely together
>I turn back and look
>Its glasses, she's got a brimming evil smile on again.

>She does enjoy seeing me suffer
>"Yeah, i was grinding against him like the entireee time." -
Birthday
>She's got her hand firmly down the back of my sweatpants though,
i'm not escaping.

>"Well i didn't have a shirt on, his chest was fully pressed
against mine" -Blondie
>She's like squirming with glee at this statement
>I guess it was really good for her.
>"And his hands were all over my stomach, it was so hot!" -
Blondie
>Her voice is like a flittering songbird singing out to a mate.
>I don't know how she does that, but her excited voice is
something to behold.
>Well it was excited until Birthday points out that Glasses got
the same treatment.
>"She's right, but i didn't tickle glasses"
>I don't say this though
>That would be really stupid.
>But i was really confused when everyone was looking at me
>OH NO THAT WAS IN QUOTATION MARKS WASN'T IT
>im so sorry past self ):

>Nobody is talking
>Everyone is looking at me
>Blondie's not looking at me though
>She's looking through me and saluting the american flag with her
freedom face on.
>Head held high, right hand over her breast.
>She knows she's temporarily won the war.
>"I guess shirtless kisses really are better huh?"
>Birthday says this with a defeated sound in her voice
>I actually felt a little bad
>I did get quite a bit more actual skin contact with Blondie and
Glasses than i did her.
>Although i would have probably exploded in my pants if she had
been able to get any more physical with that kiss.
>Homely suggests Herself/Birthday get a Re-Do with shirts off.
>This sounds like a great plan at first
>I'm nodding on the inside.

>Wait a second
>My eyes narrow
>I realize its a clever homely trap
>She's the only girl that's not wearing a bra
>I would have to kiss her topless
>I contemplate asking glasses if i can borrow her bra
>[spoiler]To wear myself as protection.[/spoiler]
>then i realize there's just a better plan
>I relax back into my seat
>Glasses doesn't remove her hand though
>Its still down the back of my pants -.-
>I shift over and whisper into glasses' ear
>"Homely doesn't have a bra on, would be... unfair"
>Her hand is probably very visible down the back of my pants
>I don't want to look at all the women but i can feel the heat of
eye lasers.

hand.

the base of the chair

couple of times.

her face.

of what actual girls think.

punches me hard in the shoulder

my face and walks down the hallway

>They're screaming "Accept me"

the entire thing just slides off.
>Her words and actions scream confidence.
>But she's still holding the Bra in both hands where it fell
>It's almost defensive
>Her body language screams embarrassment, with the tiniest bit of
fear
>I think she's scared i'll reject her

>Valid fears for anyone in that situation i guess.
>I'm still on my butt on the ground looking up.
>There's tits
>I'm looking
>Smaller than homely's, Large Cs
>Her areola and nipples are smaller too, just enough to notice a
difference.
>But instead of red, they're light pink.
>She's absolutely ravishing, i'm not sure where to look because
the entire package is so enticing.
>She's standing with her arms still held forward and together by
holding the bra, one leg slightly ahead of the other under her
long skirt.
>To top it off the expression in her eyes has leaked slightly and
her face is backing it up.
>The position itself is rival to some of the best modeling you'll
ever see. The emotions passing it far beyond anything comparable.
>I don't get to stare very long though
>She takes a step forward, and blurts out
>"Tell me i'm better!"
>It's definitely not confident, its like a desperate plea

>I'm of course more than happy to blurt out
>"Yes you're be-"
>But i'm interrupted by being pounced again and kissed
>I'm not knocked backwards though
>She lightly forces more and more of her weight against me until
i slowly reel backwards and lie down

awesome.

>Hell yeah

>She's moving her entire body against me
>She's got one of her legs folded up underneath her
>This puts her knee right against my crotch.
>Not in a painful way though, it's like its there just to provide
the right amount of pressure and friction
>Her breasts are rubbing up and down ever so slightly every time
she applies pressure with her knee.
>Her kiss is involving our entire faces now
>We have our mouths wide open, chasing down one another like
we're trying to eat the other participant
>Each time we catch the other, it just ends in a stalemate as we
go back to tongue play.

it's actually pretty fucking fun.

>I take a chance between kisses and slip my other hand under her
skirt.
>It ends up on her left panty-clad butcheek
>Its much hotter under the skirt, and her panties are made out of
some soft silky material
>This just kind of slides around in my hands and i don't have a
firm purchase, but it's amazing nonetheless.

but somehow its like seventy times nicer than men's in terms of
fabric quality[/spoiler]
>[spoiler] It's got to be something to do with how thin the
material usually is[/spoiler]
>I've got my other hand slowly working under her skirt as well,
but its slow progress because i have to stop it wherever it is
and hold her tightly every time we play the chasing game.
>The hand starts on her bare lower back.
>Pauses temporarily on the mountains of her upper tushie.
>Enjoys an afternoon stroll across her clothed upper thigh.
>Uses the skirt as a shade from the hot summer sun on her lower
thigh.

>Eventually Monsieur hand makes his way to the bare upper thigh
>He's on tiptoes now, sneaking ever closer to his goal.
>He's on edge, he knows he might be caught any moment.
>With relish he reaches ze goal he's been traveling for.
>With one movement i clasp my hand softly over the entire crevice
of her pantied crotch.
>From her butt, to where my fingers are pressing lightly right
below her lower navel.
>She freezes
>an odd look on her face as she sits up slightly.
>She doesn't remove my hand though
>Her legs squish together as she changes position and i find
myself happily stuck here, one hand on her behind, one right
between her hinds.
>The only real sensation i can feel is heat emanating off of
where Mr. righty is visiting.


>Birthday finally speaks
>"So...?"
>So what i'm thinking in my head
>i'm not sure this is what i should be saying right then though
>My brain wasn't exactly working at full steam
>Or half steam
>Or any steam
>It might have been empty
>It must have been empty because i simply repeat "So..." and look
at her questioningly.
>Her confidence is back, she doesn't look as fragile anymore, but
i know it's probably all there if i poked the wrong spot.
>"So... am i better?"
>Holy shit that's what this was about wasn't it
>I completely forgot
>Of course you're fucking better woman, i would have just told
you if you asked me
>Not that i mind how you asked of course
>In retrospect this would have probably been the proper response
>Instead i try to be suave and "cool"
>yeah, im cringing too.

>"You had to ask?" Was my ill thought out response.
>To make it worse i punctuated it with a wiggle of my fingers
right where she could feel them.
>this seemed like a good idea at the time
>Her funny look doesn't stop
>It doesn't change to hurt, or sadness, or happiness
>It's just kind of confused.
>I can almost see her changing slowly from "Loved" to "Unwanted"
in her eyes
>My brain isn't working correctly because she's still got her
knee pressing firmly against my hardness
>But i can tell she's not liking the answer
>I dimly realize i probably just made it about sex and not her
>I had given the equivalent to the after-romp question of "Was it
as good for you as it was me?"
>Don't ever do that anons.
>I rack my mind and just blurt out an answer i think will smooth
it over.

>"Yes"
>That does it, her entire posture softens
>Her upper body relaxes, her chest sinks an entire inch and
brings her beautiful breasts along with it.
>Her eyes are back to smiling
>i retreat to my older thoughts of "I would have just fucking
told you woman"
>I say some of these words
>Looks like i'm not fucked
>I'm just looking at her expectantly
>I'm pretty sure i had a pleading look all over my face.
>Please insert another coin to continue
>pls

>She repositions her knee, it's no longer pressing firmly against
me, instead its on the other side of my leg
>This opens up her crotch, and lets my hand breathe again.
>She's just kneeling above me topless.
>Both of her legs straddling me
>Both of my hands under her skirt, one on her left buttcheek, one
placed flatly across her panty-covered most private place.
>She's not moving
>She's got a kind of quizzical smiling face on, like she's
deciding if she wants to do something or not.
>I take the chance, might as well
>I take the hand i have on her crotch and place a firm amount of
pressure with my middle finger right into her pubic bone.

>I just watch her face, as i slide it down, inch by inch across
her panties.
>Where her slit starts...
>She's got a look of focus on her face as if she's concentrating
on something.
>Halfway down
>She strains a tiny amount and bites her lower lip.
>Bottom of the curve
>No movement in her face
>still the same focused concentration.
>I round out the last bit with the lightest caress of what i
could only assume was her rear, before i moved my hand to the
back of her thigh.

>Her look softens, then hardens again.
>She seems to have made a decision.
>"Thanks for picking me"
>She leans over and picks up the bra where she left it and begins
putting it back on.

>Million things going through my head
>She definitely thinks that she is for-sure the one i picked
during the kissing game.
>I mean the whole point was to give everyone enough clues to
think it was them
>But now she REALLY thinks it was her.
>I'm not sure where my opinions lie on this

>She's got her bra back on though, hidden the precious things
from sight while i was thinking about what she just said.
>Still have my hands on her glorious ass though
>Aint taking this away from me
>She stands up
>She's taken this away from me
>I see a hand hovering in my vision
>Oh i guess i should take this
>I'm hauled to my feet
>Still have a boner of a million armies
>I'm not stopping here
>Fuck that

>I wrap my arms around her, pinning one of her arms to her side
and the other between me and her.
>I lean in for a kiss
>I close my eyes
>I meet her finger
>I open my eyes

>A single finger separating my lips from meeting hers.
>She's giving me another quizzical look, but its softer and it's
almost saying "I'm sorry"
>I have absolutely no clue what she's thinking but i was just
kiss-blocked by her finger
>She lets loose a whisper
>"Not now..."
>Her breath is hot and cascades across the features of my face
>It feels lovely
>But
> ):

>I let go
>She backs up and straightens up
>She points at the sink
>We're both kinda covered with slobber i guess
>It's not a very cheery time, we both kind of just solemnly clean
ourselves up and wipe away any traces of what happened here.
>Its much easier since we don't have shirts on
>We finish cleaning up and i get another sad apologetic look from
her
>I don't know what i could have possibly done to deserve that
look
>It must be something she doesn't want to tell me
>Maybe she's afraid of being caught by everyone else, or
something else simpler.
>Caught
>Oh right we should probably not exit the bathroom together
>I offer to go first and just duck into the guest room and wait
out her reintroducing herself to the crowd for a while.

>I do just that
>I close the door behind me
>The room is a darker and much quieter stark contrast to the rest
of the house
>I guess the girls were back in the living room playing video
games from what it sounded like.
>I turn away from the door and glance over at raven
>she's somehow shoved all the pillows all over the place and is
lying on her back.
>I remember this is a bad thing
>I walk over and sit on the bed
>half of her torso is sticking out and it looks like she's half
tangled in the blankets
>I think one of her feet is even hanging off the edge under the
covers
>She seems to be sleeping happily unaware of this though
>Silly girl
>I slightly chuckle to myself comparing her chest to the two i
had just had shoved in my face.
>Still, small has its merits, and i shove this thought from my
mind as i roll her over.
>little bit of repositioning later, i've got her back on her side
and wrapped up properly.
>Even got her arms around that hugging pillow, her chin resting
on the corner of it softly.
>She has no clue, but she's winning major cuteness points in her
sleep

>fokin adorabul

>I hear the door click though and i'm brought quickly out of my
dawwing
>I turn around to find glasses closing the door behind her
>She turns around and seems completely surprised to see me.
>I mumble something like "she was just sprawled, i put her back
on her side"
>She doesn't seem to say anything, she just gives a kind of
half-nod.
>I guess that was a good enough excuse to have been gone for all
this time and found in the room with an unconscious half-naked
girl in it.
>I hoped glasses trusted me at that point, i sure felt like she
did.
>She turns towards the door and starts to leave
>I stop her
>"Glasses" This is just her full name
>"Are you mad at me?... from earlier?"
>She doesn't turn around
>We're both just standing there silently for a bit
>longer than a bit, it's maybe 20 seconds, neither of us saying
anything.
>Eventually she turns around

>She turns with one leg, the other just remains stationary
>It's more of a pivot
>She's smiling though
>The light is kinda bad, but from the distance i think i see a
wet spot between her nose and her cheek.
>I wonder if she was crying, but i'm interrupted by her chosen
statement.
>"No"
>This is just a harsh flat word in my ears
>I'm crestfallen
>I know that she means way more than she's saying
>I'm mulling this over, what her real opinions are on the subject
for about a third of a second before she continues
>"Because you chose to kiss me first".
