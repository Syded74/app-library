Author's Note: Unlike most of my stories, this series is not
intended to be a 'stroke story', but more of a realistic tale of
romance between a boy and girl.



Summary: Max gains the courage to repeat a failed attempt at
something, leading to a pair of revelations. Later, Kimmy invites
him to play a game of house.

  "Power Rangers," Max said in a deep voice from behind Kimmy's
Mickey Mouse doll. "Rita Repulsa sent her Putties to the front of
your house. You must beat them all up." A Red Mighty Morphin
Power Ranger mask with a thin, white string tied to each of its
sides covered his face. His brown eyes were visible through the
holes in the visor. Also, he was wearing pajamas that looked
similar to the Red Power Ranger costume, and his white sneakers
with the red lights in them.

  "Yes, Zordon," accepted Kimmy. Like Max, an elastic, white
string held a Power Ranger mask over her face. Hers was pink.
Along with it, she wore a long sleeve, pink shirt with jeans and
white sneakers.

  "Yes, Zordon." Max gave Mickey/Zordon to Kimmy. "You go this
way, I'll go that way," he commanded.

  "Right," replied Kimmy. She ran to one side of the yard, while
he raced in the opposite direction.

  "Pink Power Ranger, help!"

  Kimmy turned around and looked back. There, she saw Max on his
backside in the grass, swinging his fists at an unseen threat.
"Hold on, Red Power Ranger!" she said, sitting Mickey Mouse on
the brick steps and then heading towards her friend. When she
reached him, she pulled the imaginary villain off and helped Max
up.

  "Thanks."

  The boy and girl turned so they were standing back to back, and
threw their hands up in a sparring stance. Then they separated to
fight more pretend Putties.

  "Look out!" Kimmy warned, pointing behind Max.

  Max turned, then jabbed the air in front of him, hitting
another imaginary villain. "That was close."

  The area filled with their battle cries and voiced sound
effects as they punched and kicked the invisible bad guys.

  "I'm thirsty," Kimmy announced after a while, walking up to
Max.

  "Me, too," said Max. "Let's get some juice."

  The kitchen of Max's apartment had black and white tiles and
the walls were white. The white refrigerator was between two
brown cupboards and had various food-themed magnets on the door.
A silver toaster was on the wooden counter, next to the
refrigerator. The black stove was on the right side of the
fridge. The silver sink, which had a wooden cabinet on the
bottom, was a few feet across from the stove.

  Max reached into the refrigerator and pulled out a big, metal
can of Ecto Cooler Hi-C. Its trademark yellow label featured an
image of Slimer chugging a clear cup of green juice, below the
red Hi-C logo. 'ECTO COOLER' was posted in Slimer's thought
bubble. A big orange encircled by two white rings was beside the
green ghost, who had his large tongue hanging out.

  Kimmy watched him from the dining room. Mickey Mouse sat on the
table, next to a yellow KFC mug that resembled Tweety Bird's
head. The room was a small area between the kitchen and living
room doorways. A long, mahogany table was in the middle, and was
surrounded by four wooden chairs with gray cushions. A round
ceiling light was above the table.

  With two hands, Max brought the heavy can over to where Kimmy
was seated. He then retrieved his long-snout, Wile 'E Coyote mug
from the counter. Starting with her cup, he lifted the container
and tilted it so the green liquid poured through a hole that was
poked into the top.

  "Thanks," she said from behind her mask.

  "You're welcome." After returning the juice, he sat in the
chair that was facing the kitchen.

  Max watched as Kimmy removed her mask and put it on the table.
He thought her face looked so beautiful behind it. Ever since the
day before, when they made their first attempt at kissing, he
could not get his mind off another try. He wanted to tell Kimmy,
but wasn't sure how to.

  Unbeknownst to Max, Kimmy was feeling the same way. Holding the
Looney Tunes cup to her lips, she drank until it was 1/4 full.
Knowing that the boy was staring at her, she avoided eye contact
and glanced at his mouth. She longed to kiss those lips, but
didn't know what to say. After finishing her juice, she put the
cup down.

  "Kimmy?"

  "Hmm?"

  "Can...? C-can...?"

  Kimmy nodded, urging him to go on.

  "Can wetrykissingagain?" He mumbled so low and quick that Kimmy
couldn't understand.

  "What?" she asked patiently.

  "Can we try kissing again?" Max slowly repeated.

  Kimmy's eyes glittered. A heart-melting grin immediately came
to her lips.

  Max let out a relieved sigh and smiled back at her. "I think I
can do it."

  "Yes. I would like that. Let's count to three before we do it."

  "Yeah." He stood up, prompting Kimmy to do the same.

  They were now standing right in front of each other.

  "On the count of three. One..."

  Max licked his lips and hesitated. "Two..."

  Kimmy swallowed spit. Another pause. "Th-three."

  Before they knew it, Max and Kimmy moved forward until their
puckered lips tenderly pressed together. Both kids felt a wave of
excitement wash over them. The kiss only went on for a couple of
seconds, but that wave lasted well after they quickly pulled
away.

  Kimmy let out a soft gasp. She licked her lips and touched them
with her right hand.

  Max diverted his eyes to the wooden floor. Slowly, his lips
quivered into a small smile. Cheeks ablaze, he looked at his
friend.

  Their eyes met. Kimmy's index, middle, and ring fingers were
now covering her mouth. Through the veil that was her right hand,
Max could see a grin. They stared at each other for a moment,
unsure of what to say. Trying to form a straight face, Kimmy
slowly dropped her hand.

  "It felt nice," noted Kimmy.

  "Yeah," agreed Max. He rocked his upper body back and forth,
head down and eyes full of bashfulness. "So... does this make us
boyfriend and girlfriend?"

  Kimmy pondered for a moment. "I don't know. Boyfriends and
girlfriends are boys and girls who really, really like each
other."

  "Well... do you? Like me as a boyfriend?" He looked at her and
became all ears.

  Kimmy blinked at her blushing friend. She figured, they kissed,
so why not? "Yes. I really like you, Max," she confessed.

  Max deeply inhaled through his nose. "I really like you, too,
Kimmy," he responded, smiling broadly. "I liked you ever since we
first met."

  "You did?" Max nodded. "Me too. I wanted to tell you earlier,
but I was ascared you wouldn't think I was cool enough."

  "You're a really cool girl, Kimmy. I like you a lot."

  "What do you like most about me?"

  "Umm... you're really... cute, and it's fun to play with you."

  Kimmy blushed brightly at the compliment. "You're cute, too,"
she replied.

  Max smirked, shyly. "Do you think about me a lot?"

  "Yeah. Do you?"

  "Yeah. A whole bunch of times."

  "How much do you think about me?"

  "I think about you... this much!" He held his arms out as far
as he could.

  "And I think about you... this much!" She held her arms out.
Because she had a longer reach, her arms were spread out farther
than his. "Now that we're boyfriend and girlfriend, what do you
want to do?" she asked, setting her arms down.

  "I don't know."

  "Wanna go to my house and play house?"

  "How do you play that?"

  "You can be the daddy and I'll be the mommy. You can pretend to
come home from work and we can take care of our babies."

  "Okay."

  Digging through the container of her toys, Kimmy picked up a
Baby All Gone doll. It had blond hair and blue eyes, and it was
wearing pink pajamas.

  Max left the room while Kimmy put the doll in a chair that was
by the table. Next, she put Mickey Mouse in the chair beside Baby
All Gone. She then turned on her Easy Bake Oven that was on top
of the table. The oven was white with blue and purple buttons and
a black door. Max opened the bedroom door and walked up to Kimmy.

  "Hi, honey," Max greeted, trying not to laugh.

  "Hi, dear," Kimmy replied, holding her arms out and wrapping
them around him when he got close enough. Max was about to pull
back, before Kimmy smirked, "Aren't you gonna kiss me?"

  Reluctantly, Max leaned over and kissed her lips. They both
averted their eyes and smiled. "Hi, kids." Max picked up Baby All
Gone and hugged it, then did the same to Mickey. Kimmy was mixing
brown batter in a transparent bowl. "What's for dinner?"

  "We're having cake for dinner." She put the batter in the oven.

  "Cool!" Max said, excitedly.

  Kimmy went into her toy container and pulled out a clear bottle
with a blue top, a small, yellow and pink can, and a pink jar.
"Time to feed the baby." She put the can on top of the bottle and
squeezed it. Milk filled the bottle up to the top until she
stopped squeezing and put the can on the table. "I'll feed our
daughter while you give her some milk."

  "'Kay," said Max, taking the milk.

  Kimmy opened the jar and dipped a blue spoon inside. Next, she
held it to the baby's mouth and the cherries disappeared from the
spoon. She did this once more and let Max give her the drink. Max
held the bottle to the doll's lips and let it drink 1/3 of the
milk.

  "Don't be jealous, Mickey," advised Kimmy. "You're a big kid,
you can eat cake with mommy and daddy.

  By the time the kids were done feeding 'their baby', their
dinner was finished. Kimmy took the cake out of the oven and put
on some chocolate icing with a green, plastic spatula. The cake
was small and had two layers. When she finished covering it with
chocolate, she poured white icing on top. Finally, she cut it in
half with a blue, plastic knife and put one half on another white
plate.

  "Dinner's served," she said. Max stood across from her. "Don't
forget to feed Mickey some of your cake."

  They ate the cake in silence with green, plastic sporks,
occasionally pressing their pieces of cake to Mickey's mouth
before eating them.

  "You're a good cook," Max complimented when they finished.

  "Thanks. Wanna do something else? That mommies and daddies do?"

  "Like what?"

  "Lay down on my bed."

  Max climbed into Kimmy's bed and laid on his back with his
hands by his sides. Kimmy got into bed and crawled on top of him.
She put her hands beside his shoulders. Her legs were on either
side of his closed ones.

  "What are you doing?" Max asked, confusedly.

  "I heard that mommies and daddies do this to each other." She
rubbed her body up and down his. "Does it feel good?"

  "I guess so."

  Kimmy grinded herself against Max's still body for several
minutes. She had an expressionless look on her face, while his
face showed curiosity.

  "Wanna do that to me?"

  "Okay."

  Kimmy rolled off of Max and laid on her back. He crawled on top
of her and repeated her earlier actions. It went on for a couple
of minutes and he rolled off of her.

  "What do you call that?" asked Max.

  "It's called 'getting fresh'," Kimmy answered.

  "Oh. It felt nice." They laid beside each other for a few
moments. "Can we play with some more of your toys?"

  "Yeah."

  They got out of bed and went for Kimmy's toy box.
