A little flirt
In a schoolgirl skirt
Lays down upon her bed;
Quiet, coy, 
A look of joy, 
Though not a word is said.

Excitement new, 
Big eyes blue, 
Skirt's pulled above her waist.
No words at all, 
As panties fall, 
To stockings ringed with lace. 

Now legs spread wide, 
And hands astride,
She opens kitty-chan;
She shows inside, 
Where cherry hides,
Then closes lips again. 

But another tug 
At kitten snug, 
At her sweetheart slit below--
She's spreading, then
Lips close again, 
While a little voice says, "Hello!"

Now fingers ply,
She laughs, she sighs, 
At the funny game she playing
"I love you,"
"Do you love me too?" 
She has her pussy saying.

Then, smile beaming,
Eyes a-gleaming, 
She makes her pussy say,
The words so dear
Men long to hear-- 
"Make me your little lay." 

Her lover true, 
True lover new, 
He climbs between her legs
Her fingers spread
To welcome head;
"Please fuck me," pussy begs.

Thick cock drives hard, 
Breaks virgin's guard, 
Conquers sacred keep,
Then pulls back out, 
And pussy shouts! 
"Oh please, again! Go deep!"

Sweet kitty moans, 
As man full-grown, 
Rides hard his little mount.
Their love confessing, 
Pussy stretching, 
Her kitten now a fount. 

His pace is steady,
But soon he's ready,
Balls achingly in need;
No pussy talk--
Too full of cock!
As man unleashes seed. 

His balls explode-- 
Load after load--
Her little womb is filled.
Pussy quakes, 
Girl's body shakes,
And not a drop is spilled. 

Now man sits back, 
Cock going slack--
Girl knows just what to do--
Her fingers in, 
She spreads again, 
And pussy says, "Thank you."
