<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Signs of Hope</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Mr
Hargreaves, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General to the Bastanian
Republic, sadist and big time embezzler, was in a foul temper as he
spoke over the telephone to the Prisons Minister.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"I agree,
Minister. It was right to bring the girl back. She is a good fighter
and we need her. But she mustn&#8217;t get it easy! Keep her under constant
watch and make her life a misery. We can't have her punished to the
extent that she can't fight, but make her life very hard. I hate that
cow. No one spits in my face and gets way with it. The other one? She's
had a rough time and had gone to seed. Another month should see her
right again. Then I want her up against Miss Chambers. Not a death
fight just yet -&nbsp; we don't want to, lose either of them right now,
but a fight to a knockout finish! That cocksure young filly won't have
it so easy against the other one! I know they were lovers at the camp,
but in the ring they're both out to win. Why! She even killed her best
friend - remember? These fighters are animals, Minister! Animals and
scum. Women are even worse than men. No sporting instinct. Just born
killers. </span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Remember,
Minister! These two are still chain gang women. They get to sleep on
the floor and they get no clothes. If that cow Chambers had been taken
to that fight naked she wouldn't have got even as far as she did in her
escape. No white prisoner is the be taken to the fights clothed in
future.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">I'm off to
tour the work camps today. I like to see those stuck up cows working
naked eighteen hours a day. I'm going to talk to the overseer. Those
fucking bitches get it too easy. I want the whip used on them a lot
more and we are cutting their rations. Obese, overfed under worked
cows. I'll show them!"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">The Minister
phoned the main prison and asked for the chief Jailer.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"Karl. That
Miss Chambers. You are to keep a very close watch on her at all times
and make sure she is given rough treatment. Keep her fit for the fights
but she gets no privileges, no favours and plenty of punishments. When
they take her to the market to fight, do not send your assistants. Go
yourself. I am trusting you, Karl!&nbsp; Watch her and guard her around
the clock. Only use your best men on her and devote as much&nbsp; of
your own time as you can. Hargreaves insists. And she and Angelina are
to be kept naked at all times, and chained at night in the yard."</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Karl put the
phone down and smiled. The fools had played right into their hands this
time! He ordered Lilly to be given twenty strokes of a slipper on her
always bare backside. Ultra hard, ultra tough Lilly would shrug off
such a punishment and in any case it would sound a lot worse than it
felt! But people would get the message that Lilly was having a rough
time.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">He sent her
to fight a succession of three native women in the market on
consecutive days and was delighted to see her win easily each time.
What a wonderful girl she was! After the third fight he saw her safely
stowed away in the van and went across to speak to the young woman who
was always watching, always waiting. He tapped her gently on the
shoulder and she looked petrified.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"Miss Green?
Can we talk somewhere? Not here and not now. See that tavern over
there? Tonight at ten. I will meet you outside." </span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Then he got
into the rear of the van, alone with the two fighters. Lilly, concerned
for her opponent now the fight was over, was helping the loser clean
herself up. She looked up at Karl and grinned. It always did something
to his stomach when she did that. Something nice!</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">***************************************</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"We are
really in luck, Mr Marcelinus. I can still hardly believe it. I have
just had a talk with a man called Karl von Verstein. He's about thirty
and I think he's South African. He wasn't too keen to talk too much
about himself. Didn't really sound like a German somehow, despite the
name. He's the number two at the prison. Virtually runs the
joint!&nbsp; And he's recently been given instructions to keep Lilly
under observation at all times! And, here's the good bit! He's totally
but totally in love with the girl. Really besotted! Head over heels! He
wouldn't stop going on about how brave, lovely, sweet, and adorable in
every conceivable way she was. Embarrassing! Believe me! The sun shines
out of Lilly's arsehole as far as our Karl is concerned!&nbsp; After
the whipping she was given he's out for blood. Can&#8217;t look at her back
without crying. He'll kill any and everyone who had a hand in his
darling Lilly's whipping! And he'll help us get Angelina out of the
country. He wants us to take Lilly as well. But I can't see that would
be a problem - just one extra girl?"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"No problem,
Marina! But first we have to get the girls out. Did Herr von Verstein
have any ideas on that one. And what if Lilly returns Karl's affection?
Maybe she will want him to come too? It will certainly be hard for him
to explain the loss of two prisoners!"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"He's working
on it! And he's no fool, Mr Marcelinus. I trust him! And I've no idea
if Lilly fancies him. She's a lovely looking girl, but my guess is that
she prefers other women to men! I mean, it&#8216;s not very feminine to love
fighting the way she does. Although I liked boxing at school and I&#8216;m
normal enough!"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"I take it
Angelina is also at the prison?"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"Yes. She's
not fit to fight as yet. She needs to work hard on her legs. Plenty of
skipping and running. But she has been training some of the girls, both
white and native. That's how Emma improved so amazingly. I wish she
could come too but I doubt it can be arranged."</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"How does
Lilly come to be back here so soon? I&nbsp; thought they'd give her a
year in the chain gang. At least!"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">"Angelina
agreed to come back and to fight again, but only if Lilly could come
with her. That's why it took so long. There was a lot of disagreement
apparently about whether Lilly could come back so soon. Finally they
decided to give her another whipping in lieu of the months she still
had. Angelina said if they touched her again, she'd refuse ever to come
back. So Lilly was finally allowed to return with Angelina and her back
escaped a second whipping. Angelina's such a lovely good girl. She
mustn't stay here for long! We must get her out!"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">*********************************</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Mr Hargreaves
checked the revised diet sheets for the work camp prisoners. Then he
went over the work returns.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;These three
prisoners have incredibly poor productivity, Warden. Have them flogged
in front of the others. Now! Fifty lashes apiece and reduced rations
for a month!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Hargreaves
watched as three middle aged women, who had been working here for
twenty five years and were old before their time, were cruelly whipped.
It was hardly likely that they would still be alive when the Consul -
General made his next visit.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">In happier
days all three had been daughters of important members of the Colonial
administration. Hargreaves as a poor and lowly clerk had hated those
indulged and frivolous bitches. Walking past him with their pretty
noses in the air as if he were a nasty smell. And now Hargreaves pretty
well ran this place .</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;He ran
it with the aid of a corrupt government and a few fools in the Foreign
Office and State Department who had no idea how their man in Bastania
and his American counterpart were tyrannising a whole country, albeit a
small one. And the nicest part of Hargreaves&#8217; life was persecuting
innocent white women for no better reason that his own personal
inadequacy and king-sized inferiority complex.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">He went back
to the capital well pleased with his day&#8217;s work.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">After he had
gone, the Warden had all three women taken off duty for a week and
increased their rations. He had their wounds treated with such
primitive medication as was available. And he thanked the three guards,
who had punished the poor wretches, for going extremely easy on them.
The Warden was a decent man and there were a lot like him who were
itching to rebel against these two bastards and the madmen who were
running the country on their behalf - milking its wealth into numbered
Swiss bank accounts.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">**********************************</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I ordered
her to be beaten with a slipper again, Minister. Her behind is as red
as a beetroot!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;A slipper!
Are you going soft in your old age, Karl? Twenty strokes of the cane.
I&#8217;ll come round myself and see them laid on. Give the job to the
strongest man you can find! And she gets it every other day until I say
it&#8217;s to stop. It won&#8217;t affect her fighting ability. Get it arranged,
Karl. I&#8217;ll be there in thirty minutes. Mr Hargreaves would be furious
if he knew she had been let off so lightly! Furious!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Karl put the
phone down. He looked ready to cry at the things that were still being
done to poor Lilly. </span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Let the time
be short until I can get her and Angelina&nbsp; out of this stinking
country !&#8221; he prayed.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">****************</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">The Minister
stood watching as Lilly was tied to a frame ready to be caned. The poor
girl was almost bent double, with her arse cheeks positioned for the
blistering they were about to receive. She could hardly breathe in this
position and knew it would be even worse once the cane started to land
on her. She had seen the cane and shuddered, brave girl though she was.
It would draw blood with every cut and she was due to receive twenty.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Then the
Minister gasped. He clutched at his chest and his face was purple. He
fell to the floor and in seconds was being rushed to hospital.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Lilly
remained where she was for half an hour, getting more and more
uncomfortable. Then Karl came and released her. She looked into his
eyes. </span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Thanks,
Karl. There are times when I love you!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t
mention it, Lilly. And there are times when I love you. Like all the
time!&#8221;</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">As she and
Angelina lay side by side in the yard, chained to the ground for the
night, Lilly told Angelina about&nbsp; Karl.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;He loves me,
Angelina! Jealous?&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;A bit. But
it&#8217;s good news! With his help, we&#8217;re much more likely to get away. He&#8217;s
the man who really runs this place. The Warden is senile and mostly
drunk. Don&#8217;t be affectionate to me any more, Lilly! We don&#8217;t want Karl
to get jealous. And don&#8217;t let on you fancy him, whatever you do! If the
authorities knew about you two they&#8217;d move him.&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Next day,
when Karl was alone with her, Lilly stressed how important it was to
keep their affection for each other secret.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;One way of
showing how little you like me would be to give me that caning, Karl!
Don&#8217;t you agree? But don&#8216;t make me bleed, darling. Just leave me badly
bruised!&#8221;</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Karl obliged.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">For the next
week Hargreaves was too busy trying to find a replacement for the
stricken Prisons Minister (whose role included so much more than
prisons and was very much a key figure in the financial racketeering
that he and Potter were organising. ) to have time to pursue his
vendetta against Lilly.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">Meanwhile,
Angelina was rapidly becoming fit to fight. She lay under the night sky
chained next to Lilly and the pair discussed the day they would have to
face each other.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I dread it,
Lilly. How about you?&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;A fight is a
fight to me, Ange! I&#8217;m a pro! I&#8217;ll show you no more mercy than I&#8216;d show
any opponent. That means none! You&#8217;d better forget our friendship when
we climb into the ring! I won&#8217;t kill you, darling, but I&#8217;ll knock you
out! With the minimum of force!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">
