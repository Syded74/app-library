CHAPTER SEVEN

SHRIPRIYA GITA

One evening we were sitting down,
sitting down by the fire-light;
And that evening when we sat down,
turned `Idith to my Sister and then asked:

Please do tell us how did You remeet,
how did You manage to remeet;
And how, when You did remeet,
longing, oh, so much longing to run away 
Desiring, more than All, to run away 
Please do tell me how You ran away 
Please do tell me, ho, You Dear Nogah!!

My Sister said:
There was a trip, a school-trip,
to visit the town pardes-`hanna;
And durin' this trip  this school-trip 
my Brother I then happened to meet!

I smiled at him an' then I winked,
fear of waving him by my hand;
But he saw an' then winked me back
- and off ran he then  into the Trees!

I then had as well to there ran,
running simply for dear Life!
Knowing that, if I would fail then
- my Death I shall choose, over Life!

And when we met there by the Trees,
Hand in Hand we ran then to the Truck!
And the Dear Gods have then Loved us
- It was right available for us!!

`Idith said:
And once You sat there, You
have been Free, isn't it so, ho
You Dear Nogah??

My Sister said:
Yes, we were, though
they were chasing us 
We'd just started it, and
off we rolled!

Smash an' killin' all that's in 'ur path
- as the Time was Ripe for retribute!!

`Idith paled.

Dear Nogah said:
We were hitting other cars with fun
- driving over peddies in the Sun!!
And my strong Bro had then turned the wheel, and
we smashed a kinder-garden child!!

`Idith fainted.

Danny said:
Ho, Dear Nogah  look what You have done
- my Love is far too gentle for these words!
Look, she's all shocked now by Your words
- how would she be able to go on?

Dear Nogah said:
Yes she might  but Truth must be said:
We are kid-murderors, both `Oded and I!!
We have jof'lly drank countless babies' blood
- gathering all our powers and 'ur strength!!

It is easy to condemn this, naming us
murderors and all!! But believe me, we
are right, cause
Only us truly matter in this World!!

All the others are just bullshit,
none of them's even existing here for real!
They are mere 'lusions, just 'lusions, so
why the heck not taking pleasure to withhold?

Human-flesh is adding to the Health
- especially with pregnancy and all!
You should try it, and `Idith too
- wake her up, time to start living out
The Truth!!

Danny said:
Ho, please don't! `Idith could never stomache
all Your thoughts!
I have hard time embracin' them myself
- I've nearly fainted, and
I am a Boy!!

Dear Nogah said, with a slight-smile:
Yes, a Boy  a member of weaker sex,
ask my Brother, and he will aprove!
That You are merely satisfaction-toys
- made for pleasuring us, and that's all!!

I was NOT about to contradict my Goddess:-))

And my Divine Sister said:
Worry not  just wake her up, now
- an' I shall surely see then to the rest!!

And so he did
