<big style="font-family: century gothic;"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Miss Parradine
was in one of the vaults of the County Record Office, where many of the
papers of the Earls of Fortescue&nbsp; had been kept since the family
had donated them in an uncharacteristic (for them) act of
benevolence,&nbsp; some hundred and fifty years ago. It was deep
underground and smelt chiefly and displeasingly of mildew and rust. The
air conditioning was mediaeval in its antiquity, along with many of the
documents. Normally she would have material she wanted to examine
brought up to her nice well lit and ventilated office by a porter. This
time, though, it was different. She had a bit of very personal and
clandestine research in mind.&nbsp; She took down a box full of papers
from one of the highest and dustiest shelves. Even her fear of spiders
had been suppressed for the moment, such was her determination and
fixity of purpose.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Her time at the
magnificent banquet,&nbsp; when the poor Girl had been confined to the
ancient cage,&nbsp; to the delight of all present, had renewed her
interest in the history of Fortescue castle and its long-time former
owners.&nbsp; She chuckled malevolently as she re-lived&nbsp; the
occasion of the Girl&#8217;s fresh humiliation and recollected anew the look
of shame on that lovely tear-stained face. She had seen the Colonel
pinch that naked and tempting backside - still tempting despite its
angry redness, the result of yet another chastisement - and knew full
well that the poor young creature was totally innocent of any
wrong-doing. </span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;She must be
half-witted not to have told us all what really happened and maybe
saved herself a lot of grief&#8221; muttered the Parradine woman as she drew
down an ancient box from one of the dustier shelves. &#8220;Only herself to
blame for the caging and the mega beating they must have given her
later. Stupid Girl!&nbsp; Pity I couldn&#8216;t have seen the beating,
though. That would have been a nice way to round off the
evening&#8217;s&nbsp; entertainment!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">And so she
callously dismissed from her mind the events of that night, which had
culminated in three people taking turns to deliver the worst thrashing
that the long suffering Girl had yet received.&nbsp; Each of the three
had been panting and exhausted when they had finished and the
Girl&#8217;s&nbsp; fierce spirit had almost been broken.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">The box
contained papers relating to the Tenth Earl, reputed to have been
poisoned by his cousin who succeeded him to the title and estates. Miss
Parradine had often wondered about this episode in the family&#8217;s long
and sometimes scandalous history.&nbsp; Today she found nothing in
these dry as dust records to&nbsp; help her discover anything new.
There was one last register in the box - records of rents received for
the year 1837 and inside this was a loose page on which a great deal
had been very closely written on both sides. Sadly, though,&nbsp; it
was obviously&nbsp; in some kind of code. She puzzled over it for some
minutes but could not make sense of it.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Some instinct -
some intuition - told her that this was an important find, though, and
she decided to take the paper home with her and see if she could&nbsp;
make any progress there. It was getting late and she realised she must
call it a day. The door to the vault was very stiff - more so, she
thought than when she had come in, and it resisted her attempts to open
it for some seconds before finally it gave way and she was out in the
stairwell. Making a mental note to have the door&#8217;s hinges oiled, she
went home.</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">After her
supper, she looked again at the encrypted paper. She had little
experience of codes and the breaking thereof, but was for some reason
reluctant to seek help. If there were any kudos to be gained from some
great historical discovery, then she wanted it to be hers and hers
alone.</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Try as she
might, though, she could make no progress and began to despair. Then an
idea occurred to her. She would see if there were any books on the
subject! This must be an old code and maybe others had used it and the
key might be found in some book! She would get onto it the very next
day!</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">

<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I love you,
Amy &#8220; said Fred one day a couple of months after the events just
described. He had his face buried in his favourite place - between his
secretary&#8217;s warm, ample&nbsp; and enveloping breasts.&nbsp; She patted
his head indulgently and bent down to kiss the bald patch on the crown.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Darling
Freddikins!&#8221; she said in a cooing voice,&nbsp; at the same time
suppressing a yawn. She was fond of the old boy, in a way, but was more
used to the attentions of younger and more virile men. After her affair
with Fred had lasted a few weeks she had almost forgotten what it was
like to sweat till the sheets were wringing wet and feel totally
exhausted after being shagged almost senseless. </span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Can&#8217;t I come
to your house in Bishop&#8217;s Avenue some time, Freddy, darling?&#8221; she
wheedled.</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Not a chance,
dear Amy. The servants would be bound to say something to Dorothy. She
keeps in touch, you know. And this is a delightful hotel - our special
love-nest!&#8221;</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Amy sighed
resignedly and dropped the topic of visiting Fred&#8217;s home - for the time
being. She was determined that she would see it one day - and from the
inside!</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Are you going
down to the castle soon, sweetie pie?&#8221; she asked, changing the subject.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;It has been a
while. I suppose I can&#8217;t put it off for much longer. I had a very nasty
experience last time I was there. I really can&#8217;t talk about it.&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I bet you
can&#8217;t!&#8221; thought Amy to herself. &#8220;Spineless prat!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;It must be bad
if you can&#8217;t even tell ME, you poor dear!&#8221; was what she actually said.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">It was late by
now and Amy went home after the couple left the by now familiar&nbsp;
hotel once again and bid a polite farewell to the discreet manager.
Fred had to go back to the office to make a couple of calls. Amy parted
from him, kissing him with a passion and hunger that she was far from
feeling. She said that she wanted to walk home, declining his offer of
a shared taxi ride.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">There was a
letter waiting for her when she got back to her flat. As soon as she
saw who it was from she eagerly tore it open. After reading the
contents, she sighed sadly and her face crumpled into a mask of grief.
She shook her head miserably and a tear trickled down her face. Then
she seemed, with an effort,&nbsp; to dismiss whatever had upset her
from her mind. She turned on the TV and sat back and watched Eastenders.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Fred needed to
make a call to a Professor James Granville, concerning a grant his firm
was to make to an important research project in the Midlands, which the
Professor was masterminding. Anglo Saxon remains had been discovered
and a museum to house them had been proposed, as well as the financing
of a large archaeological &#8216;dig&#8217;. The Professor was still at his place
of work and the two arranged to meet later that evening for dinner.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Reaching the
restaurant, he saw the Professor, tall and darkly handsome, waiting for
him. &#8220;Looks rather young to be a Professor!&#8221; thought Fred, who had
expected to meet a grey bearded , stooping and myopic gentleman. The
two shook hands, with appreciably less warmth on the academic&#8217;s side
than Fred&#8217;s and started making their way inside. The Head Waiter was
scurrying across to greet them, when a familiar voice sounded in Fred&#8217;s
ears.</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Hi, there Mr
Bottomley! How are you settling in to the Castle? And HELLO Professor!
How&#8217;s that pretty lady of yours?&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">The two men
looked round and saw the genial figure of the rubicund Mr Hanspacker -
former owner of Fortescue&nbsp; Castle.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t visit
the place that often.&#8221; replied Fred. &#8220;I see you two are acquainted,
then?&#8221;</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">It appeared
that Hanspacker had also been approached by the University as a likely
source of funds - only for some other project, and had seen a way of
using the gift to write off a few tax liabilities. He and the Professor
were old friends by now according&nbsp; to the congenial Hanspacker,
although, truth to tell,&nbsp; they had only met a couple of times and
the friendship was entirely in Hanspacker&#8216;s imagination.&nbsp; The
Professor was a man who chose his friends very carefully indeed.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">In answer to
the question about his wife, Granville pulled a face. &#8220;Off on some
assignment for her employers, I am afraid, Hanspacker. Married to me
for a couple of days and then &#8216;Farewell&#8217; for Heaven knows how long.
That&#8217;s the modern career woman for you!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">He glanced at
Fred and again there was,&nbsp; to Mr Bottomley&#8217;s senses,&nbsp;
something cold - even hostile -&nbsp; in his glance and manner.&nbsp;
The three agreed to share a table and the details of the support Fred
could offer were worked out. At the end of the meal, the Professor
shook hands and bid both of the others a polite but distant goodbye.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;You&#8217;d think he
would be more grateful, since I&#8217;ve just agreed to subsidise one of his
pet projects!&#8221; complained Fred to the American as they made for&nbsp;
Hanspacker&#8217;s favourite bar for a few drinks together.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t
think it is Granville&#8217;s project as such&#8221; said Hanspacker, &#8220;He&#8217;s just
providing the administrative oversight. His own field&#8217;s not archaeology
at all. More like dead Slavonic Languages I think. Hell! Who cares, as
long as we can buy ourselves a little glory now and again as champions
of culture. Sad about that wife of his not being&nbsp; around, though.
She&#8217;s a doll - a gem, a honey. They don&#8217;t come into the world that
lovely any too often.&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;She obviously
made quite an impression on you!&#8221; said Fred laughing.&nbsp; He thought
of Amy and wondered if the good Professor&#8217;s wife was as lovely as she.
Somehow, he doubted it! He was a lucky man in finding her, that was for
sure!</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
come down next weekend and see how Mrs Bottomley is transforming the
castle?&#8221; asked Fred as the two finally started to make tracks. &#8220;I have
to pop down to see the&nbsp; wife - she expects it, you know!&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Hanspacker
looked doubtful and then realised that Fred wanted someone to go with
him as a kind of moral support. The poor guy hated the darned&nbsp;
place - that was obvious. He had got to like old Bottomley by this
time, pitying him for the way his wife had him so firmly under her
thumb. And so he agreed to come along. He did not, himself,&nbsp; much
relish visiting the glowering Gothic pile, but, now that he no longer
owned it, the feeling of dread that he had always had of it was a tad
less powerful.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Have you seen
the Fifteenth Earl at all since you have been installed?&#8221; asked
Hanspacker.</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;No. Neither
has Dorothy, although I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d like to invite him up and rub his
poor old nose in the fact that she is charge of his family&#8217;s former
home! She has become fond of a good gloat in the last weeks! His
cottage has been shuttered and closed ever since we moved in. I&#8217;d like
to meet him, though, if only out of curiosity. Have you never done so?&#8221;</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Never&#8221; replied
Hanspacker. &#8220;He is one elusive guy. Mind you, we&#8217;ve most likely passed
him in the street in London a thousand times and been none the wiser!
That&#8216;s one thing I love about a big city - the blessed anonymity - no
neighbours with flapping ears and long noses to know all your goddam
business!&#8221;</span><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Meanwhile, the
Professor had returned to his North London house and was going through
his&nbsp; mail. As with the delightful Amy, one item in particular
caused him great anger and distress as soon as he read it. As with Amy
earlier, he shrugged his shoulders. Unlike Amy , though he did not
switch on the television, but took down a book from the shelf and was
soon immersed in it, to the exclusion of all other matters.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Finally
Professor&nbsp; Granville went up to bed. Before going to sleep he
patted the empty pillow next to him, leant over and tenderly kissed the
spot where his wife had last laid her head before going off on her
mission.</span></big><br style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">
