A few weeks after their separation, Jeff received an email from 
Kate. It was her first direct communication since she had kicked 
him out.


-*-*-*-*-*-
Jeff:

You can come by to pick up some things. Anything of yours you 
don't take I'm going to throw away. I don't want to see you. How 
could you do it? I did everything I could as a wife for you! I 
was faithful and loving and always helpful. Everything revolved 
around you and your needs. Well, your "needs" obviously were more 
important than our marriage to you. You are a complete bastard!

Kate
-*-*-*-*-*-



Kate had come home from work early, not feeling well, but really 
dispirited because everything was going so badly with Jeff, and 
when she'd seen a second car in their driveway she'd wondered 
what was happening. There was a strange voice, a woman's, when 
she opened the door, and she'd crept back to the bedroom. Already 
she was suspicious. At the first voice she knew. Everything fell 
into place. Everything. Everything came out of her chest and 
stomach, where she was instantly empty and weak, and where she 
felt a strange tingling. She crept along the hall, trying to 
control her breathing, not wanting to look, trying not to make 
crying sounds, knowing this was it.

Jeff was lying naked, on his back on the bed, right in the 
middle. Some naked woman Kate didn't know was straddling him, 
obviously impaled on his erection. He was holding her hips and 
sliding them back and forth on his groin, and her hands were flat 
on his chest, right over his nipples. Her breasts were swaying 
fast with her body motions, almost whipping back and forth, Kate 
thought, when she thought about it later. Jeff was panting but 
not making noises. It was the woman Kate had heard. She was still 
doing it, making high pitched, breathy grunts, showing how close 
she was getting by the pitch and the loudness. It was obscene. 
She was almost there, doing Kate's husband in Kate's bed, her 
vagina stuffed with Kate's husband's penis, her head tilted back 
and the one eye Kate could see almost closed. Jeff's pants 
changed so Kate knew he was close too, and that he was going to 
have his pleasure with that stranger in her bed. It was then that 
Kate had screamed.

"No! No! Stop it, stop it stop it!"



Jeff's return email came within ten minutes.


-*-*-*-*-*-
Kate:

Maybe I am a complete bastard, but it was hardly my needs that 
ran the marriage. I'm sorry I ended it that way, by fucking in 
our house. I should have been more manly and walked out long ago. 
BTW: I have everything I want. I don't want anything that reminds 
me of all the time I wasted on you.

Jeff
-*-*-*-*-*-



Kate was outraged. She thought it had been a nice gesture to tell 
him he could come get his things. He certainly didn't deserve 
them. Bastard! Bastard, bastard, bastard!



-*-*-*-*-*-
You Son of a Bitch!

When did I ever do anything for myself? You always came first! 
You're too selfish to even realize that! Well, I'm sure you'll 
enjoy your new life, with your bimbos.

Kate
-*-*-*-*-*-



It was six hours later. Kate was writing an email to her mother, 
telling her about Jeff's latest stunt, when his next letter 
arrived.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Kate:

>When did I ever do anything for myself? 
 ==>How about making it impossible for me to ever do anything for 
you? Hating every present? Always showing me how little you 
thought of me? Hah! Being caught with another woman was hardly 
worse than putting up with how you acted when I tracked in some 
mud last winter! You were always waiting to catch me doing 
something wrong. Anything! I could never please you. You'd play 
the ice maiden. Well it's over. I don't have to think about that 
any more.

>Well, I'm sure you'll enjoy your new life, with your bimbos.
 ==> Not a bimbo. A nice woman who happens to enjoy sex with me, 
after I went a long, long time without that. *My* needs?!? 

Jeff
-*-*-*-*-*-



Fifteen minutes later:



-*-*-*-*-*-
Jeff:

> ==>How about making it impossible to ever do anything for you? 
Hating every present?
You never even tried! You always went out at the last minute just 
to get something! Anything! It was too much effort for you to 
plan or try something really special.

> A nice woman who happens to enjoy sex with me, after I went a 
long, long time without that.
When was the last time you even touched me?
-*-*-*-*-*-



Kate went to bed as unhappy as she could remember being. It was 
as bad as the first days after she'd caught them. She kept 
remembering the sight of him, so happy with that other woman. She 
thought of how they had once been happy themselves, how they'd 
spend hours in bed, touching and kissing and talking. She 
couldn't get out of her mind how nice he felt when she ran a hand 
over him, the texture of his muscles and bones. How long ago had 
that been? What had caused the rift? Had she really pushed him 
away? She hadn't meant to. It was hours before she finally fell 
asleep.

Before breakfast she turned her computer on and found a new email 
waiting for her. 


-*-*-*-*-*-
>It was too much effort for you to plan or try something really 
special.
==> Touch. I'm not saying I'm anything close to perfect. If I 
were I wouldn't have taken up with another woman. I'd have left 
long ago. I've got flaws. You're right that I let things go by, 
that I could have tried harder on the presents. I'm sorry about 
that. I really am. 

But it doesn't change the fact that you submarined what I bought 
you, again and again, made long lists of what you didn't want, 
and showed your obvious displeasure with the things I tried to 
surprise you with. It was all part of your way of being 
controlling. Make me feel inadequate. Make be beholden to you. 
That was always your game, and it got worse with the years.

>When was the last time you touched me?
==> And when was the last time I *wanted* to? I used to touch you 
all the time. I used to like touching you, and I think you liked 
it too. But when did you ever initiate sex? In all our years? 
Ever? Once or twice? Don't you lecture me about not touching!
-*-*-*-*-*-



She was perplexed with the first paragraph, angry with the 
second. Then she read the third. Then the whole thing again. Then 
again. Once more. The complexity of how it had happened hit her 
for the first time. 

"Oh, Jeff," she whispered. "Why did it come to this? Oh God." She 
began crying, and when she couldn't make herself stop she called 
in sick at the office. Then she moped around the house most of 
the day. At lunchtime she finally felt she could answer his 
letter, but she couldn't get through it.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Jeff:

I'm sorry about making it hard to get me presents. I know it's 
true. But you could have done more. That's all I meant. You never 
made me feel special, by doing anything really out of the 
ordinary. I know it wasn't all your fault.

About the sex and touching. Well, I didn't begin lovemaking much. 
I know. But I did touch you. I always liked touching you. Don't 
you remember how I'd give you baby powder massages? (and you'd 
usually turn that into sex, anyway!) Or how I'd snuggle up 
against you before I went to sleep? And maybe I didn't begin sex 
very often, but did I ever make you think I didn't enjoy sex with 
you? At the end I got so lonely, because you shut me out.

Damn it! I told myself I wasn't going to let you make me cry any 
more. Go away!
-*-*-*-*-*-



Jeff was writing a letter when hers arrived. He read it and 
replied right away. Hurry, man! Damn! Damn!



-*-*-*-*-*-
Wait, Kate. Don't log off. Please. I don't want to hurt you. I 
never meant to hurt you. Getting caught was stupidity. Oh shit. 
Look, we hadn't been intimate in any way for so long. When the 
"other woman" came into my life, I thought it was a way I could 
keep the basic marriage going, at least as a shell or something, 
and not be so frustrated and unhappy all the time. I didn't "try" 
to break us up. I thought at some time it might get better. But 
no I didn't have any plan to make it better. Before you say it, 
no I didn't think very far. I know I hurt you badly. I'm sorry, I 
wish I'd acted better. Maybe it's for the best. I don't think you 
much cared for me anyway. Not by the end. This way you can find 
someone else.
-*-*-*-*-*-


Kate didn't respond. Jeff waited for almost an hour before 
logging off. The next two days he checked his email every hour or 
so. Finally he decided the conversation really was over, and that 
it really was for the best. He hadn't wanted to hurt her though. 
No, that wasn't true. He'd wanted to hurt her at first, but at 
the end he wished he could have comforted her.

He had dinner with Mary Ann, and spent the night at her 
apartment. She seemed awfully fond of his penis. The next morning 
he stopped by his apartment to change clothes, and found an email 
dated the previous evening.



-*-*-*-*-*-
How can you say I didn't care for you? That's not fair!!! If you 
had touched me, if you had asked, I would have said yes. When did 
I ever say no? You knew I liked it with you. You always said you 
liked how I responded. And there were the things I didn't want to 
do at first that I did for you, because I loved you. Like taking 
your p---- in my mouth. Don't you remember at all? Do you just 
blank out all our sweet times?

Kate
-*-*-*-*-*-



He stared at it for several minutes. At work he thought about it. 
At lunch he read it again, then answered.



-*-*-*-*-*-
I always liked it when you used your mouth on me. You never just 
did it, though. I had to ask. I had to ask at everything. Like it 
was some favor you were doing me. It was always that way, and 
when I was so angry with you I wasn't going to ask.

But you ask if I remember. Yeah, I remember a lot. The last time 
we were really good in bed together. I remember baby powdering 
you all over. I massaged you everywhere. I did your whole body, 
not just your breasts or vagina. I went around and around your 
ass. You told me afterward that you got chills during it. I 
remember. Do you? You thought it was so erotic when I powdered 
your underarms. I masturbated you and finger-fucked you until you 
came. I remember. It was wonderful. But it was like always--I had 
to do it. I liked doing it. Don't get me wrong. But it never 
would have happened if it were up to you. You never would have 
started it. It was like I had to get you to grudgingly have sex. 

Jeff
-*-*-*-*-*-


Before he went to bed that night he took one last look at his 
email. There was a new one from Kate.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Dear Jeff:

You're right. I'm sorry. About that you were right. I already 
admitted it. I didn't initiate our sex. There's a reason. It's 
something I never told you. I've never told anyone. I'm so sorry 
Jeff. I'm sitting here feeling sad. I've been trying not to cry 
all evening, because I know I should have been a better wife 
about that. Maybe I should have told you before, or tried to do 
something about it. I know I should have. It's too late now, but 
I have to tell you. 

The fact is I'm not one of those women who want sex. I don't mean 
I don't like it. I always liked sex with you. But I didn't "want" 
it until you'd get me "started." I loved snuggling you and 
touching, but I wouldn't feel sexy doing it. It was nice, and 
when you'd start touching me I would like it because it was you 
and I loved you. Only after we would play a little would I get 
turned on, though. Sometimes not even then, but usually. Almost 
always. You could almost always make me want to do things. You 
had to know that power you had over me.

I remember that last good time, BELIEVE IT OR NOT! You were 
awfully graphic in your email, but yes, I did get chills when you 
powdered my underarms. And when you moved your fingers around my 
anus, (you know my ass is awfully sensitive) and when you 
powdered me between my legs. Yes, it made me hot. You didn't 
mention my nipples. Is your memory slipping? :( It was like you 
did everything in the world that works on me. It wasn't just that 
you touched me places, but that you spent so much time being 
intimate with the places. Does that make sense? It's what would 
always make me feel sexy.

I'm sorry Jeff. I just never (almost never) got sexy until you 
played with me like that awhile. I think there's something wrong 
with me. I thought I was lucky that you were so patient. I should 
have told you.

But when you did anything like that I'd get so I wanted to do 
anything you wanted, even things that in my "normal" state I 
thought were kind of gross. It just isn't fair to imply I just 
lay there or something. Do you remember how that last time ended? 
How could you forget? I turned around and gave you a complete 
b--- j--. Don't you remember? And I liked it.

I guess it was after that that things really started to go 
downhill.

So...I don't know. It seems we're just talking about the sex, and 
not the other things. About the presents. And how you thought I 
was controlling (why didn't you just tell me go to hell? I didn't 
know it hurt you so. You never showed that you were hurt! I 
though that you just didn't care what I felt, and I would get 
angrier and angrier).

I'm sorry.

Kate
-*-*-*-*-*-



Kate's computer chirped "There's a letter for you" at 10:43 p.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Dear Kate,

>I though that you just didn't care what I felt, and I would get 
angrier and angrier
==> So I would hate it that you were cold toward me, and you 
would hate it that I wouldn't respond. I didn't respond because I 
didn't want you to know how much you hurt me. So I was stupid 
again. You don't have to tell me. I know. That's the kind of 
thing we could have worked out. Shit.

>But when you did anything like that I'd get so I wanted to do 
anything you wanted, even things that in my "normal" state I 
thought were kind of gross. 
==> Anything? If I'd known that, there are other things we'd have 
done. After I got you sexed up.

You know this is the first time we've really "talked" in a long 
time. I wish we'd done it earlier. I miss you.

Jeff
-*-*-*-*-*-



She responded at 10:56, and was going to log off, but she thought 
she'd see if he responded, and what he would say. She had 
written:


-*-*-*-*-*-
Dear Jeff:

>You know this is the first time we've really "talked" in a long 
time. I guess I wish we'd done it earlier. I miss you.

Don't go there Jeff.

Kate
-*-*-*-*-*-



11:07 p.m.


-*-*-*-*-*-
Dear Kate 

>Don't go there Jeff.
==> But it's true. I know it's too late. I'm just telling you the 
truth. We spent a lot of time not telling each other things, it 
seems. Please don't tell me not to be truthful now.

I think we've written most about the sex because for a long time 
it was so good and it helped us over bad times. Even if I did 
have to start it, you really were very responsive. :-) I'm 
remembering it more now. And I do remember how you worked to 
please me. And that I really didn't have to ask you all the time. 
And I remember that you sucked me off completely that last good 
time, and that it was fantastic. I was unfair in my letter. I'm 
sorry.

Love
Jeff
-*-*-*-*-*-



11:27 p.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Dear Jeff:

>Please don't tell me not to be truthful now
No, I won't tell you not to be truthful. Anyway, about oral sex. 
To be honest--At first It just seemed "fair" to, you know, "do" 
you, since you would do me, and you know I liked it a lot!  : 0 
!!!  But I did get to like doing it. I could tell how much you 
were enjoying it, and that would make me happy. And I liked your 
taste and the feel of your penis (I can't believe I'm writing 
this!). I know I only gave you a few complete b--- j--s, because 
I had to be very aroused to get myself to do it all the way. I 
would have done more, though, because I enjoyed making you 
excited, but usually about the time I could get myself to finish 
you, you'd take matters into your own hands and go to straight 
sex. I'm really not a prude. I just need the time and lots of 
foreplay.

Kate
-*-*-*-*-*-



11:34 p.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Dear Kate:

I remember eating you, and how you'd sometimes grab my hair and 
pull. I love the smell of your vagina.

Love,

Jeff
-*-*-*-*-*-



11:41 p.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Please Jeff. Don't do this. It's too late. I wish I hadn't 
written what I wrote.

Kate
-*-*-*-*-*-



11:46 p.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Dear Kate:

Maybe it is. But we never tried. Maybe we could try. I'd work to 
tell you to go to hell when you were cold to me, and I'd try to 
be better about presents. No -- I would be better. And we would 
talk more about things. And I'd play with your body as much as it 
took to get you in the mood.

And I'm glad you wrote what you wrote.

I Love You.

Jeff
-*-*-*-*-*-



11:51 p.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Jeff, no. I couldn't stand you to hurt me again. It almost killed 
me. You can't understand how much it hurt! I still haven't 
recovered. Sometimes, when I think I'm okay, I'll suddenly see 
you with her again, and it just tears me up inside.

I do love you, but we can't do this.

Kate
-*-*-*-*-*-



11:56 p.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Kate, My Love:

I wouldn't ever hurt you again. I swear it. I would never again 
go near another woman. Ever! I would spend my life trying to make 
it up to you, and showing you that you could trust me. What I 
would do is hold you and kiss you and fondle you severely.

I didn't understand you before. I think I understand you better 
now. A lot of things make sense now.

Love,

Jeff
-*-*-*-*-*-



11:58 p.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Please Jeff. No.
-*-*-*-*-*-



12:02 a.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
I want to hold you and touch you again. I miss you so much. And I 
have baby powder. 
-*-*-*-*-*-



12:07 a.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
Please Jeff. Don't.
-*-*-*-*-*-


12:12 a.m.


-*-*-*-*-*-
Can I at least come over to see you tomorrow, Kathryn?
-*-*-*-*-*-



12:15 a.m.


-*-*-*-*-*-
Please Jeff. It *is* tomorrow. Can you come over right now? 
-*-*-*-*-*-


12:19 a.m.



-*-*-*-*-*-
I'm on my way!!! 
-*-*-*-*-*-



The End?
