Summary: A young woman's journey into the spirituality inherent in her body(sacreligious)
*******************************************************************************

Grenn was all about salvation. She was always ready to assume the "missionary" position and be "born again". The place where her children had come out of was where birth occurred, so it seemed like the proper place for the various "instruments of the Lord", attached to various of the male faithful, to rise up and be reborn. It was a temple of love and God had repeatedly exhorted the faithful to love one another without being overly specific about the details. 

She had first learned about horizontal prayer from a preacher's son in high school. She enjoyed her training in the ways of spiritually connecting with a man so much she was quite open to instructing his two younger brothers as well. When they cried out, "OH MY GOD" and "I'm in heaven now!" as they frequently left their holy balm in her sacred place, she felt truly blessed. She liked to have that feeling often. Her boyfriend made her promise never to reveal or discuss what the "special prayers" involved or it would be like revealing a wish and all the goodness would go out of it. She wasn't the brightest candle on the altar and just figured that some spiritual matters were a mystery so she kept the faith and kept on loving her small congregation of brothers. 

When she graduated from high school she got the job as church secretary at "The First Word of God Almighty Fellowship". She thought that the strange speaking they did in worship might be like her babblings when an especially strong visitation of the Spirit occured. This might happen when prayer partner was vigorously uniting with her. The rather worldly preacher soon taught her some new ways to pray when he determined the details of her "spiritual" experience. Grenn felt very blessed that such a learned and religious person would take a personal interest in her spiritual development. His prayer techniques were way better than the young men she had prayed with previously and she opened her temple doors every day she worked. When she met the pious and innocent young man who would become her husband she was instructed not to pray with him in the "special way" until the minister said that her fiance' was spiritually ready. The minister made sure the young man had the basics and told Grenn she would be leading her husband to the Lord on their honeymoon. He held a prenuptial retreat with her the night before the ceremony and his four love offerings were still seeping out of her crotch as he performed the wedding. 

Glenna remembered how she had taught her first prayer partner's younger brothers to pray, so was quite successful with her virgin husband. He never questioned why she was so good at the prayerful arts since it was all he could do to keep up with her spiritual needs. The preacher continued to pray with her regularly even through her two pregnancies. He was snipped so the babies DID come from her spouse. Then she got fixed per his advice so that sex would be strictly for worship and not procreation. 

Years went by and Grenn's husband became a better lover and a deacon. She thought that their coupling was more godly than ever because of his church position. When she reached forty they were at another church in a bigger town with four deacons including her husband. She was still quite attractive with long black hair on her somewhat padded 5'2" and darkly tanned body. The padding was mostly in her tits and ass so she was definitely built for comfort. That was very nice when you wanted the long prayer sessions she preferred. 

One night when his softening dick was soaking in her love temple, Grenn told her husband that she felt the need to make a spiritual contribution to the church. When he asked for an explanation he was surprised and aroused by her answer. She only spoke of the concept per her vow of silence but he read between the lines. About a year earlier his wife had partaken of sacramental wine much more than usual. She was very horny when they got in bed and, when his pecker was pumping, began speaking in a slurred voice about "liking cocks in her cunt" and "fucking the brothers". She never used those four letter words so he began guiding her recollections to learn that his beloved wife's "holey" place had been often visited by eager worshippers for many years before and after he met and married her. Now he understood her skills on their honeymoon. The next morning she complained about a sore head and pussy with no memory of anything that happened in bed. 

He decided to get a bit of variety in his worship too and responded to some lusty married female coworkers who had been hitting on him. Appreciating the benefits he might receive from Glenna's interest in ministering to males, he nodded gravely and suggested that the other deacons and perhaps the minister might like her "special prayer" gatherings. He already knew what wolves lurked beneath their church robes from the times that the guys had shared liquid "spirits" and talked more openly. He worked with his wife to set up a schedule of "prayer meetings" with the deacons and tipped off the next prayer partner that it was ok with him. He was delighted to learn that all of them had gotten past monogamy and each deacon's wife would expect Grenn's husband to visit when their husband was getting laid (oops, "prayed"). These women just wanted to get down and dirty with a new cock. Prayer was optional.

Grenn came home bubbling top and bottom. Her husband cleaved unto her avidly in spite of a thorough draining by another wife earlier. He praised the silky feelings of love in her temple and happily added his own. They joined a lot more frequently than they had for a long time and Grenn was thrilled and full-filled. Both spouses looked forward to her weekly meetings with the deacons. She really enjoyed joining with different worshippers and experiencing their brand of supplication. And her husband was anxious to have hot and heavy praying with her right away. Mmmmmm, she liked that. After a few weeks the minister approached Grenn. He was about 70 but healthy and trim. He told her that he had heard about the special ministry and could use some special praying himself. His wife was feeble and could not pray that way with him. Of course her husband agreed and so she got on the minister's schedule like the other deacon's wives. While she loved her husband's hard love stick in her, she couldn't think of any hard love stick she didn't feel the same way about.

The final step to heaven was when the minister arranged for the four deacon couples to attend a retreat at an adult nudist resort. Glenna was told that removing clothes made it much easier to worship. No secrets, no shame. She embraced being completely open to the Spirit and when the abundant sacramental wine hit she just fucked everybody that had a hard dick not already buried in another wife. Being on a spiritual high and eager for more prayer partners, she demonstrated the power of pussy prayer to several attractive men she found on the beach who were possible converts. They were not easily persuaded, she noted, and required repeated temple visitations. They did, however, show their appreciation with monetary donations to the church after each time with her. Maybe she should be a missionary, she thought, as the assorted love liquids ran out of her pussy. She had heard somewhere that you should enjoy your work...and she sure enjoyed praying with partners.
