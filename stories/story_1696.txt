<h2 align="center">Fair Go! (M/m, F/m, m/m)</h2>

<p>The following account refers to events that took place in the
early part of 1970 when I was in the Fifth Form of a prestigious
Australian boarding school. I was a precocious child and as a
result of this, I had been allowed to begin my secondary
education two years younger than was normal, so at this stage I
had only recently turned 14 years old. </p>

<p>After this length of time at the school, I was completely
acclimatized to the environment and I was now considered to be a
senior student. Academically I was one of the strongest students
in my Form - in all modesty, probably the strongest - and I had
started to work exceptionally hard. In my early days at the
school, I had been rather poorly behaved, I am afraid. Ill
disciplined, impulsive, more than a little dishonest, but over
time my behaviour had improved markedly and so by this stage I
think that it is fair to say that I was reasonably well respected
in the school by those in power and authority, I was bright,
hardworking, and generally well behaved. This didn't mean,
though, that I was free from the fear and fact of corporal
punishment. In fact, to an extent, the opposite was true. I was
seen as having real potential that needed to be preserved and
nurtured. If I misbehaved, it was considered that much more
important to bring me back on track. In a real sense, once we
entered the Fifth Form, I feel that the school tended to deal
more severely with those they had the highest hopes for. I wasn't
punished anywhere near as often as badly behaved boys, but that
was because I misbehaved much more rarely. When I did misbehave,
my punishments tended to be more severe. The school also streamed
its pupils into groups based on ability and achievement and I was
in the top stream for every subject that I was doing. In some
cases there was only one stream, but generally this meant that I
was grouped with those others who were deemed to show real
potential. So the practice of treating us a little more severely
than was normal, was something I had to deal with all the time.
Not every member of staff did it. But enough did to make it
rather noticeable. </p>

<p>At the start of Fifth Form, they generally gave boys four
weeks to get back into decent schoolroom habits. And when the
fifth week came, that's when real and serious learning started.
And that's when this story takes place. </p>

<p>I was already working hard before this fateful week arrived. I
had slacked off my very first week back, but a 'discussion' with
my House Master convinced me that this was rather unwise and so
for three weeks, I had been working hard. I was doing a lot of
subjects - more than was normal - and there were a couple that I
had deliberately taken because I thought they would be easy. One
of these was History. </p>

<p>The teacher of this subject was one of our fairly rare female
teachers - a Mistress rather than a Master. Miss Gill was quite
young - perhaps in her late twenties or early thirties - and
hadn't been at the school long. I believe this was her second
year there. She was a nice enough lady who generally ran a fairly
relaxed class. We knew which of our teachers were strict
disciplinarians and which weren't - she was somewhere in the
middle I suppose. She expected results and hard work, but she
didn't normally obsess about minor issues and she had never in
anyone's experience used the cane. </p>

<p>I'll be honest - about half the boys taken her class, like
myself, regarded it as a place to get easy results. And so, we
didn't take it as seriously as we should have. To be honest, it
was probably a bit rude to someone who, as far as I can recall,
was a very good and very dedicated teacher. </p>

<p>It was our last period of the regular school day, and I had my
first inter-school debate that evening. I had recently become
Captain of Debating (something I was very proud of) and
representatives of another prominent school were coming to our
school and I had to be organized to meet them and take them to
dinner. My two team mates were in this class with me, and we were
looking over our notes at the back of the room, trying to be
inconspicuous. There was quite a lot of talking going on, all
around the room and Miss Gill told us all to settle down. </p>

<p>We did for maybe two minutes I suppose, before the chatting
started up again. She let it go on for a few minutes, before she
again called for quiet. This time she seemed a little angry, so
we did quiet down properly. </p>

<p>Three minutes later, one of my teammates slid a note across to
me asking a question about the debate and rather than write a
note back - passing notes was rather more frowned on than
talking, I whispered to him: &quot;Let's talk about it after
class.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Rysher!&quot; </p>

<p>I jumped and sat up straight. Miss Gill sounded very cross, a
great contrast from her normal pleasant tones. &quot;Yes,
Miss.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Were you talking?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I was just -&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Were you talking?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Miss.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Go and see Mr Keanes and tell him that you have
repeatedly disrupted my class.&quot; </p>

<p>I was a bit shocked. Mr Keanes was our Deputy Headmaster and
the most feared disciplinarian in the school. And I do mean
feared. He really was, at this stage of my schooling, the only
master who I was genuinely frightened of. Being sent to Mr Keanes
was a serious threat. It was also quite a common one among
teachers who didn't use the cane themselves. But it was a threat
- it was rarely acted upon. It really didn't seem fair to me at
the time that I was being sent to Mr Keanes without explicit
warning - if she'd said &quot;Be quiet or I'll send you to Mr
Keanes&quot;, I would have had no complaints - and I also
wouldn't have whispered. But her warning hadn't said that, and I
really did feel this was a little unfair. </p>

<p>Now, in reality, Miss Gill had done nothing wrong at all. I
had knowingly broken a classroom rule and another teacher might
well have caned for that. She was fully justified in sending me
to see Mr Keanes, but it just didn't feel right. </p>

<p>The simple honest truth is that I was genuinely scared of the
cane. And I was genuinely scared of Mr Keanes. Add it together
and as I slowly stood up, I was feeling, just a little
mistreated. </p>

<p>I left the classroom and headed down to the main building
where Mr Keanes had his study. I was a little upset already. Mr
Keanes always caned - everybody knew it. If she'd sent to my Form
Master, or even the Headmaster, I might have had a realistic
chance of not being caned - or of getting just a token stroke or
two. But Mr Keanes - he caned so readily, and being in the Fifth
Form, the chances of me getting less than three were truly
remote. </p>

<p>I don't want to give the impression that Mr Keanes was some
sort of sadist. That would be very unfair and I have no
absolutely no reason to think that. In my view, he was simply a
very old fashioned master in an already old fashioned school. Our
Headmaster treated the cane as a necessary evil. He'd use it and
he'd use it well, but if he could find an excuse to avoid using
it, then he probably would avoid it. I don't think that ever
would have even occurred to Mr Keanes. To him, the cane was
simply another teaching tool, like chalk or a blackboard. Where
appropriate you took it out, you used it, and then you put it
away. It wasn't pleasant to use it - but it wasn't anything to
worry about either. He had very close to the same powers of
punishment as the Headmaster (possibly the same - there's one
grey area, I've never been sure about). He could cane a boy
across his trousers as any Master could - but he could also flog
a boy on the bare bottom and he did do that on occasion (although
never to me, thankfully - though that did happen twice at the
hands of the Head, himself). </p>

<p>As I entered the main school building, I was hoping that,
perhaps, Mr Keanes might not be there. I'd then have to return to
my classroom where it could at least be hoped that Miss Gill
might let me off on further reflection. But as I approached his
study, I could see that his door was open and I could hear him
talking inside. So I resigned myself to the inevitable and sat
down to wait until he was free. </p>

<p>&quot;You are in a great deal of trouble, Clayton. Refusing to
take a caning from a Master is a very, very serious thing. I
should flog you right now without question. But you're very new
here, so I'll give you a chance. Go back to class and take your
punishment and we'll say no more about it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;But I didn't do anything wrong!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Mr Cannon says you did, and I have to believe Mr Cannon.
Now once again, will you go back and take your punishment like a
man or do I have to flog you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I won't be caned.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I assure you, you will be.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I WON'T.&quot; A second later, a young boy came running
out the door next to where I was sitting and began sprinting down
the halls passed me. Three or four seconds after that, Mr Keanes
appeared at the door, saw me sitting there, and snapped
&quot;Rysher, bring him back.&quot; </p>

<p>I jumped to my feet and gave chase. He was pretty fast for a
twelve year old, but I had a couple of years on him spent in a
very physical environment and I knew the school much better than
he did - he was only in the First Form and had only been at the
school a month. He almost made it to the gates - he was a day boy
and I think he was trying to make a bid for home. I overhauled
him, and grabbed his arms. He struggled a bit until I told him
that if he didn't calm down, I'd give him a good thumping. For
some reason he believed me and stopped struggling. But he refused
to move. </p>

<p>&quot;Come on, kid. Back to Mr Keanes.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No! Please let me go!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I can't do that, sorry. If I don't take you back, I'll
be in even more trouble and I don't want that to happen. I'm
already going to get the cane, I don't need any more of it.&quot;
</p>

<p>He started, reluctantly walking. I had my hand on his arm and
I wasn't letting go, and I'd have dragged him if necessary.
&quot;What did you do, kid?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nothing!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;OK, what did they say you did?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Mr Cannon says I threw a spit ball at him, but I didn't.
It wasn't me.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Did you tell him that?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I did. But he wouldn't believe me.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well... you'll get away with stuff you did at some
stage. It all evens out in the end.&quot; I spoke from
experience. While most canings I had received were richly
deserved, there had been a couple where I hadn't deserved it. But
for each of those occasions, there were at least half a dozen
where I'd got away with something I could have and should have
been caned for. I'm not saying that made the unwarranted
occasions, fair. But they were just a fact of life. Our Masters
tried to be fair, they really did, I think. But they weren't
perfect. </p>

<p>&quot;It's not fair!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, it isn't, you're right - Clayton, is it? It's not
fair. But you've got a choice, kid - or maybe you have a choice
if Mr Keanes is still offering. You can get two or three on your
shorts, probably, for something you didn't do - the spitball - or
you can get six on your bare bottom for something you did do
which is refuse a caning. Maybe that's fairer - but speaking as
someone who's been there, forget fair - take the lesser
punishment.&quot; </p>

<p>We were close to the doors of main school again by this stage,
and he saw this and dug his feet in and refused to move. </p>

<p>&quot;Come on, kid. Don't make me carry you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What's the problem here?&quot; </p>

<p>Coming around the corner was a sixth form boy, a newly minted
prefect. He was a day boy and we didn't know each other well, but
we knew each others name. And what he could see was an older boy
- me - with his arm locked on a younger boy - Clayton - who
seemed to be trying to get away from me. Naturally he needed to
satisfy himself that I had some lawful purpose for manhandling a
younger boy. </p>

<p>&quot;Hi Campion - I have to take this first former back to Mr
Keanes. He tried to do a runner.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;All right, Rysher... actually I think I'd better come
with you. See he gets there safe and sound. You don't
object?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Not at all.&quot; I knew he was doing his job. Making
sure I was taking the kid to Keanes. Fact is, Campion may not
have known I was now a paragon of virtue - it takes a while to
overcome a reputation scarred by being beaten in front of most of
the school. Clayton accepted the inevitable at this point. He
might have got away from me. He wasn't getting away from two
older boys. </p>

<p>Campion came with us to Mr Keanes study. When we arrived, Mr
Keanes was standing outside waiting. Campion was about to move
on, but Mr Keanes gestured to him to stop. The Deputy Head turned
to Clayton and I tried to intervene. </p>

<p>&quot;Sir, perhaps if you gave Clayton one last chance?&quot;
I hoped I'd convinced him to act sensibly. Mr Keanes looked a bit
annoyed at my interference - for all I know he may still have
intended to give Clayton another chance - and then asked the
question. </p>

<p>&quot;Will you take your punishment from Mr Cannon,
Clayton.&quot; </p>

<p>Clayton shook his head, and I have to admit I admired the tone
of his voice. &quot;I WON'T BE CANED.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, you will. Bring him in Rysher, Campion, you come
in as well.&quot; </p>

<p>I dragged Clayton to the desk, as Mr Keanes closed his study
door and locked it. Then he stepped up and closed his window,
pulling closed the curtains as well. Next to the door, Campion
switched on the lights. </p>

<p>&quot;Let him go, Rysher.&quot; I did so. &quot;Pull your
trousers down, Clayton.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;NO!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Grab his arms, Nathan. You grab his legs, Jacob. We'll
have to do this the hard way.&quot; </p>

<p>I did as I was told and Jacob took his other end and we
carried him despite his struggles to where Mr Keanes indicated
next to an old armchair. </p>

<p>&quot;Hold him over it - you both should know how it
works.&quot; </p>

<p>I pulled Claytons arms forward and then pulled down, so I was
crouching in front of the chair holding on. Campion was kneeling
down next to Clayton's legs on the other side of the armchair,
while the boy himself was bent over the top of the chair. Mr
Keanes placed his hands into the waist band of the boys shorts
and tried to pull them down, but the belt on the hips held them
in place. </p>

<p>&quot;Keep hold of him and stand up, Nathan, and you keep hold
of him, Jacob. Turn him round so he's facing me.&quot; </p>

<p>The boy was struggling but I had a good grip and was stronger.
Mr Keanes undid his belt and then the buttons of his short
trousers and pulled them down. Then he placed his hands in the
waistband of his underpants and tugged them down as well. </p>

<p>Clayton was still a little boy. No hair, his penis -
uncircumcised which I noticed because it was rather unusual at
the time - showed perhaps the early signs of growth, but puberty
clearly was not a major factor in his life as yet, and realizing
that I felt very sorry for him. A flogging was a serious
punishment, and it seemed wrong to me that such a little boy was
facing it. I realise now that he was actually a year older than I
had been when I was first flogged, but I was a second former then
and I felt older. </p>

<p>&quot;Get him back over. And hold him still.&quot; He walked
to an umbrella stand behind his door, and took out a cane, while
we pulled Clayton back into the proper position. I was looking
right into his eyes - they were wide and white, and his mouth was
open. His face was red. </p>

<p>Mr Keanes took his line, drew the cane back and slammed it
down HARD. The look on Clayton's face was hard to describe.
Shock, pain, and then tears welled in the corner of his eyes. He
looked at me almost pleadingly as the cane was drawn back and I
gripped him harder. He yelped at the second stroke, and jerked
and so did I, and then, mercifully he lowered his head down so I
didn't need to look into his face. It had never occurred to me to
turn away or to close my eyes. I was mesmerized by the
experience. </p>

<p>Six strokes in less than twenty seconds, I think, but it's
hard to judge time in this situation. I just bit my lip and held
his wrists and watched the back of Clayton's head and listened to
his yelps and sobs, until Mr Keanes had discharged the task at
hand. </p>

<p>&quot;Let him up.&quot; </p>

<p>I released his wrists and realised I'd left finger marks
there. He straightened up rapidly and his hands flew around to
his bottom. His penis flopped and it seemed to me to have
lengthened slightly since I had first seen it. I wasn't sure what
to make of that - but it had in all probability been pushed up
against the fabric of the armchair, so I did wonder if that had
had some effect. His face was red and tear stained. Jacob Campion
put a hand on his shoulder, but he shrugged it off with a very
petulant motion. I slowly stood up and waited to be told what to
do next. For some reason I wasn't thinking that clearly. </p>

<p>&quot;Pull your pants up, boy.&quot; </p>

<p>As he bent down to grab his underpants that were down around
his ankle I saw his bottom - half a dozen (I suppose - I didn't
count) angry red lines were becoming visible on the curved white
flesh. He tugged up his underpants and his shorts and then began
to run for the door. I moved to intercept, looking at Mr Keanes.
He said quietly. &quot;Let him go, it's over now,&quot; so I let
him run away. </p>

<p>I stood looking at Campion as Mr Keanes returned his cane to
the umbrella stand. He reached into his trouser pocket and drew
out a couple of coins, &quot;Here, boys.&quot; He gave myself one
and Campion one - a fifty cent coin. I pocketed mine immediately.
&quot;You two can go.&quot; </p>

<p>I realised why I was there and stood my ground as Campion left
the room. &quot;Um, Sir... I was sent to see you.&quot; </p>

<p>He looked at me, a rather stern appearance on his face.
&quot;What for?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Talking in class, Sir.&quot; He raised an eyebrow.
&quot;After three warnings.&quot; </p>

<p>He pursed his lips and considered for about twenty seconds.
&quot;Don't do it again - and I <strong>mean</strong> it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; </p>

<p>I shot off and returned to class. I went in and began to walk
to my desk. </p>

<p>&quot;What happened, Rysher?&quot; Miss Gill called from her
place near the board, her voice quite pleasant, once again. </p>

<p>&quot;He let me off.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; her tone had changed again. </p>

<p>&quot;He let me off with a warning, Miss.&quot; I turned to
face her, out of politeness. </p>

<p>She drew her breath. &quot;Go and borrow a cane, Rysher?&quot;
</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Miss -&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Go and borrow a cane.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Miss.&quot; </p>

<p>I stepped out of the room again and went looking for an
occupied classroom to see if could find a teacher who was
carrying a cane. A few doors down, I saw Mr Cannon at the front
of a class. Mr Cannon was another rather new Master and not very
good at controlling a class from what I had heard. There was a
cane sitting in open sight on his desk and I knocked on the door.
</p>

<p>&quot;Yes... Rysher, is it?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Sir. Please Sir, Miss Gill would like to borrow
your cane.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Come and get it.&quot; </p>

<p>As I stepped into the room, I could hear absolutely piteous
sobbing off to one side. At the desk closest to the door, his
head down between his arms resting on the desk was Clayton. He
was sobbing his heart out on that desk and I felt a wave of mixed
pity and contempt for him. Pity because I knew he was hurting.
Contempt because of the way he was taking it, in public. You had
to be strong. </p>

<p>Mr Cannon saw me looking. &quot;Don't mind him, Rysher. He's
had a bit of a bad time today.&quot; I continued walking to the
desk and picked up the cane. I had other things to worry about
besides Clayton's pain. </p>

<p>I returned to my classroom and handed the cane to Miss Gill.
While I'd been gone she had placed her teachers chair almost in
the centre of the front of the room. </p>

<p>&quot;Bend over.&quot; She said it is a very firm voice. And I
did as I was told. </p>

<p>The first stroke came with a second of my bending before I had
any time to prepare myself and it hurt a bit but nothing
particularly bad. The second stroke came very shortly after, very
low, very poorly targeted but she hardly took time to aim. It
missed my bottom completely, cutting in about two thirds of the
way up my calves. I straightened up - something I nearly never
did, because you were not meant to until you were told out of
sheer shock. It hurt, certainly, but not incredibly. It was
mostly a matter of where she had hit. </p>

<p>&quot;That will do. Take the cane back.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Miss.&quot; I walked out the door deliberately
smiling at my classmates until I was in the hall outside when I
leaned myself against the wall and breathed a few times to let
the pain fade out as much as possible. </p>

<p>I returned to Mr Cannon's room and knocked on his door. He
gestured to his desk and I walked over to put the cane on it. I
could see the first formers looking at me so I made sure I showed
no sign of pain at first. And then I heard another sob, deep and
mournful from Clayton and dropped my pretence. I didn't
exaggerate how I was feeling, but I dropped the happy act. It
wasn't fair to him to make it look like a caning was a joke. With
older boys, I'd have had no sympathy for him. But I knew, a month
into their first form, most of these boys hadn't been caned yet
and they were probably going to absorb the contempt us older boys
would show for weakness without any understanding of how truly
hard it could be to be strong. So as I walked back, I limped a
bit, and let my hand just rub once. Let them see it hurt. I
reached the door and stopped. And thought and turned. </p>

<p>&quot;Mr Cannon, Sir. I think Clayton needs to go to the
infirmary.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I saw what Mr Keanes did, Sir. And he needs to go. I'm
sure Mr Keanes would have sent him after that, but he didn't hang
around long enough to find out.&quot; </p>

<p>This was not on, really. It wasn't the place of a fifth form
boy to say this to a Master. If Clayton had been in my House, I
might have had some semblance of right to say this, but he was a
day boy, nothing to do with me. Still I said it and Mr Cannon
looked at me, and nodded. </p>

<p>&quot;Could you take him then, Rysher, if he's really that
hurt?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sir. Come with me, kid.&quot; </p>

<p>I lead him out the door. </p>

<p>He was crying very heavily and it was a fairly long walk from
where our classrooms were to the schools medical centre -
boarding houses had their own infirmaries, the medical centre
handled serious injuries but was also used by day boys for more
minor issues. We walked in silence for a moment and then he
spoke. </p>

<p>&quot;Did you get caned too?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I did.&quot; I decided not to tell him that Mr
Keanes had let me off, but my answer was still truthful. </p>

<p>&quot;It's awful.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it can be. But it's over now, kid.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If I deserved it... but I didn't. It was... can I tell
you who it was. I don't want to dob.&quot; </p>

<p>My contempt for him dropped back a bit. At least he understood
how that worked. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you can tell me. It's only dobbing if you tell
staff - sometimes prefects too. I'm just another boy.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It was Landon. And he shoulda owned up, shouldn't
he?&quot; </p>

<p>This was a tricky one. Our rules on schoolboy honour were kind
of complicated. It was really up to Clayton if he took a
punishment for another boy. He couldn't dob, but if he was
falsely accused all he had to say was 'Fair go' and it was then
expected for the other boy to own his offence. You did take
punishment for others sometimes - not that often, but the way
some Masters were, and Mr Cannon might well have been one of
them, sometimes all owning up did got both of you caned. So it
was left up to the boy facing unwarranted punishment to decide. </p>

<p>But regardless - once it became clear that Clayton was to go
to Mr Keanes, Landon - and thinking about it, I remembered Landon
- he was a new boy in my House - should have owned up, regardless
of the 'Fair Go' rule. You couldn't expect a classmate to take a
flogging for you when all you'd get was - I felt it was likely
that Mr Cannon might have handed out two, or at most three, for a
spitball - maybe only one if a boy confessed like that. Landon
should have owned up. But the nuances of how it worked, though
clear to me after four years in the school, might have reasonably
escaped a First Form boy. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, maybe he should have. It's hard to say. You should
have called 'Fair Go.'&quot; </p>

<p>Clayton stopped and his voice cracked as he almost wailed.
&quot;But I did!&quot; </p>

<p>And that changed everything. </p>

<p>No doubt. No dispute. There were rules. There were
understandings. There were codes. And that was a violation of one
of the most important. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Clayton. I'm really sorry. That shouldn't
have happened. And I'll try and make sure it doesn't happen
again.&quot; </p>

<p>Landon was in my House. Now boarders relationships with day
boys weren't always very good. although I think they were better
at my school than they were at many other boarding schools. We
didn't always treat day boys with complete respect though. And I
felt what had happened here quite keenly. Day boys were to an
extent, second class citizens - but for someone from my House to
violate our codes like that with a day boy as its victim - that
to me was adding injury to insult. </p>

<p>We arrived at the medical centre and I took him in. In the
reception area sat one of the under-Matrons - these were nurses
who acted to relieve our House Matrons when needed, and who
worked in the medical centre most of the time. I knew this one
fairly well, as she'd taken on my house more than once. She was
one of the youngest of them. </p>

<p>&quot;Hello Nathan. Have you been in the wars?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm just escorting Clayton here. I'll let him tell you
why. But can you give me a slip?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You're Fifth Form, do you need one?&quot; </p>

<p>Junior boys had to get a blue slip if they went to the
infirmary during school time to prove where they had been. Senior
boys - and I was one now - were trusted (to an extent - they'd
sometimes check we'd been and if they found out we hadn't, there
would be hell to pay) and didn't normally need slips. But I'd
been sent on what was meant to be a minute long errand to return
a cane, and that was probably close to ten minutes ago now - I
was missing quite a bit of Miss Gill's class, all things being
considered. </p>

<p>&quot;It might be wise, yes.&quot; </p>

<p>So she wrote me a slip and I ran back to class. </p>

<p>When I entered Miss Gill was sitting at her desk and she
meaningfully glanced at the clock. Before she could say anything,
I walked over and handed her the slip. She looked at it and at me
- and gestured for me to go back to my desk. I went and sat down
and began copying some dates from the board until five minutes
before the bell was due to sound. </p>

<p>&quot;All right, boys. After you settled down, you've worked
well, so you can take an early mark. Off you go - Rysher, could
you stay for a moment?&quot; </p>

<p>Oh great. Now, what? </p>

<p>As my classmates streamed out at the end of the day, I
approached her desk. </p>

<p>&quot;Miss, I'm sorry I talked. It was rude of -&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Are you all right, Nathan?&quot; Her voiced was very
concerned. She was holding the blue slip and I suddenly realised
that from her perspective she handed out a very rare caning (for
all I know it could have been her first) and then I'd disappeared
coming back with a note from the infirmary. &quot;Did I hurt
you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, Miss. You didn't hurt me! Mr Cannon asked me to
take one of his boys to the infirmary. That's nothing to do with
you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh good.&quot; She was obviously relieved. Then she
frowned a bit. &quot;So I didn't hurt you?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, Miss... how can I put this. Yes, you did hurt me,
but you didn't <em>hurt</em> me. I mean you did what you were
trying to do, but I won't drop dead or anything.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So that was effective?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Effective enough, Miss, that I don't want you to try
again!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad - well, not that I hurt you. I wish I hadn't
had to do that. But you were warned, Nathan. And I can't let you
get away with just ignoring what I say like that. You
understand?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I know, Miss. No hard feelings, Miss, I swear. I
shouldn't have talked - I got what I deserved - but,
Miss...&quot; I wondered if I was going too far, but decided it
had to be said. &quot;You might want to aim more next time. I
don't think you meant to get me where you got me with that second
one.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You're right. I didn't. But you're lucky - because I was
going to give you three.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;All's well, Miss, then. Can I go. I have to catch the
others so I can finish the conversation you so rudely
interrupted.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Don't be cheeky, Nathan. Yes, you may go, but be very
careful.&quot; </p>

<p>I bolted, found my debating team and we set to discussing
strategy for the night. </p>

<p>The debate did not go well that evening - no, that's not true.
We lost but that was because we were beaten by the better team.
We did a fair job, but they simply outclassed us. My mood was
rather neutral as I returned to the House. I was annoyed we'd
lost, and as I saw Landon crossing the hall in front of me, my
mood did not improve. I wanted a word with him. I wanted to make
it clear to him some basic concepts of school boy honour. </p>

<p>But I had to be fair. Maybe he didn't know what he'd done. </p>

<p>So I sought out our House Captain and I found him in his
study/bedroom. Evening was winding down - prep was over (I'd been
exempt because of the debate) and junior boys were starting to
get ready for bed, but the senior boys still had quite a lot of
time if they wanted to take it. Our House Captain for that year,
and myself were quite different personalities. He was a rower, I
was a swot. Two very different parts of the school hierarchy. But
we got on well enough. </p>

<p>&quot;Chris, I don't suppose you could tell me who Gary
Landon's mentor was?&quot; </p>

<p>Every First Form boy was assigned a Third Form boy as a mentor
in his first couple of weeks in the school. It was the mentor's
job - informally for the most part - to make sure he learned the
rules, both official and unofficial - including the basics of our
code of honour. </p>

<p>&quot;Give me a sec, Nathan.&quot; He opened a desk drawer and
pulled out a red notebook. &quot;Landon was placed with Derek
Gordon.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Cheers, Chris.&quot; </p>

<p>Derek was actually a fairly close friend - despite being two
forms younger and two years younger. Actually that was why he was
a good friend - he was the only other boy in the House who like
myself had been allowed to enter the school two years earlier
than normal. Despite our age difference, that gave us a
commonality and I took an interest in him. I'd also been his
mentor when I was in third form. I found him cleaning his teeth
in the bathroom. </p>

<p>&quot;Derek, I've got a question for you. Gary Landon was your
telem, this year?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he was. Why?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I need to check - did you tell him the codes?
Specifically did you tell him about 'Fair go?'&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I did. And, yes, I did.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure? It's important.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No doubt. I even tested him on them, because he didn't
seem to be taking them that seriously. Written test - you can see
it if you like?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You gave him a written test?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I didn't give you a written test.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You didn't need to.&quot; </p>

<p>We went into the prep room and Derek rummaged through his
desk. He pulled out a sheet of looseleaf and handed it to me. It
was a written test on the code (and incidentally when I was House
Captain the following year, I made copies and gave it to all our
first formers - because I took these things rather seriously) and
one question was on the code. </p>

<p>&quot;If you do something wrong and another boy is being
punished for it, and he cries out 'Fair Go' you have to own up to
it.&quot; He understood the code. No doubt. </p>

<p>&quot;Thanks Derek.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Is Gary in trouble?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You don't want to know, Derek.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;All right.&quot; </p>

<p>That was for both their benefits. If Derek had known what I
was going to do, he'd have been in trouble for not reporting me.
If I'd told him what I knew Landon had done - well, Landon was
meant to be able to go to Derek if needed, for help - and it
might have soured their relationship if Derek knew the junior boy
had broken the codes. Actually with Derek, it might not have
mattered. He wasn't as into the codes as I was. </p>

<p>I waited until the First Form boys were trooping to bed, and
then I walked past them. As a fifth former I had no real
authority over junior boys - sixth formers had a small amount.
Prefects had more, and the House Captain had a lot, but a fifth
former really wasn't considered much different from a first
former in the hierarchy (except in emergencies). But I was still
older, and so what I did wasn't questioned by the first form
boys. </p>

<p>&quot;Junior common room is a mess - I need one of you to come
and clean it - you Landon, you'll do.&quot; </p>

<p>He was wearing only his pyjamas - it was still a fairly warm
time of the year, and he obediently trooped down to the hall with
me. We stepped around the corner, and I turned and grabbed his
collar and thrust him against the wall. </p>

<p>&quot;Listen, you little toad. Did you throw the spitball that
got Clayton caned?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yessir.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You broke a serious code today, and Cyril Clayton copped
a flogging because of it. Now, I'm not going to hurt you. But if
you ever break the code again, I'll make sure everybody knows it.
Is that clear to you, mate?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Rysher.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You'll apolo-&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Rysher. Drop that boy.&quot; </p>

<p>Chris Bancroft, our Captain had rounded the corner and he
looked very angry. &quot;Landon, get to bed. Rysher, come with
me.&quot; </p>

<p>I followed - I had no choice. As we got to his study room, he
slammed the door in my face, and I waited until he opened it
again. When he did, a cane was resting on his bed. I walked in
and he shut the door. </p>

<p>&quot;Bullying, Rysher?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, Bancroft. It wasn't bullying.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It certainly looked like it - you had a firsty pinned to
the wall, Rysher. And he should have been in bed as well. What
the... blazes is going on?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Landon let a day boy take a flogging today for something
he'd done. And the kid called fair go - and Landon just let it
happen anyway.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I just wanted to scare him. Let him know that it isn't
on. We can't let a first former in our House get away with that -
it's not good for the House.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You should have told me.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I wasn't sure he did it. The other kid's a bit wet to
tell you the truth, and I wasn't sure who I believed. But Landon
admitted it, just then. It happened. And I hope it won't happen
again.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Still... I understand why you're angry, Nathan. But that
wasn't on.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I wasn't going to hurt him. I just wanted to scare
him.&quot; </p>

<p>Bancroft picked up the cane. &quot;I believe you, Nat. But I'm
going to have to cane you. I can't let that go on in the House
either.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I know. But it wasn't bullying.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Would you agree with... menacing?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I can't argue with that, I suppose.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Put your hands on the bed, then.&quot; </p>

<p>I bent over, and he took up position behind me. The cane bit
quite hard. He gave me three, nice hard ones. Not that severe -
certainly less than I would have got for bullying - but more than
enough to remind me of the correct way that problems in the House
were meant to be handled. </p>

<p>When it was done, I stood up as he lifted his mattress and hid
the cane under it - it probably means nothing to most but him
letting me know where he hid his cane was actually in our
understandings an expression of his trust in me. </p>

<p>We shook hands - and we didn't actually do that that often -
and I headed out. I decided that I needed a shower before bed, so
I grabbed my towel from my dorm and headed to the shower room.
There was an assortment of fifth and sixth form boys in there, as
was normal for the time of night. And nobody commented on my
marks - in junior years you showed them off. In senior years, the
cane was seen as just slightly shameful, so unless there was some
special reason to comment - like an unusually impressive
arrangement, or a very public punishment - people tended to
pretend it hadn't happened. </p>

<p>Bancroft came in a couple of minutes later and I'm sure he
looked deliberately - I know that when I was House Captain, I
always took a keen interest in the quality of my work. </p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Nathan.&quot; He was pointing at my leg.
&quot;That's not one of mine, is it?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, Chris. That was Miss Gill.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I'm not surprised. I've seen her trying to park her
car as well.&quot; </p>
