    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Mr. Henry, Marie and Steve began to make idle conversation about <br>
    their trip to Iran to fill the time waiting for Zaara to arrive while Josh <br>
    encouraged Narisa with a gentle hug and a kiss. A few minutes later, <br>
    Betty called on the intercom saying that Zaara was in the outer <br>
    office. Mr. Henry said to send her in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>There was a timid knock on the door and it opened slowly to reveal
    a <br>
    young girl about five-foot one, large brown eyes, dark brown wavy <br>
    shoulder-length hair and a honey-colored complexion. She was <br>
    surprisingly pretty - almost as pretty as Narisa - and she reminded <br>
    Josh of Doe Eyes. She had a slender figure with smallish breasts a <br>
    little larger than Narisa's and was wearing a pair of jeans with a <br>
    white blouse. The fact the she had a nice cute, small butt didnt go<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>unnoticed by Josh either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>This being her first day at school, she was somewhat frightened to
    be <br>
    called to the principal's office and also at seeing a group of people <br>
    waiting for her. Timidly stepping inside and closing the door Zaara <br>
    thought, <i>Oh my god! What are all these people here for? My parents <br>
    are gonna flip! Being called to the principal's office the first week of <br>
    high school. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Mr. Henry smiled and said, &quot;Please come in, Zaara.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>She entered the office with some trepidation and stood next to the
    <br>
    desk facing so that she could see everyone in the room. Betty brought <br>
    in another chair and she smiled and thanking Betty sat down. As she <br>
    sat, she silently surveyed the room's occupants. <i>The girl looks like <br>
    she's Middle Eastern, and she's very pretty. Hmmm, he's pretty <br>
    darn cute!</i> Zaara was lifted from her mental assessment when the <br>
    principal spoke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Zaara,&quot; Mr. Henry began, &quot;first of all, let me say
    that you're not in <br>
    any trouble.&quot; She let out an audible <i>Whew!</i> &quot;I need to ask
    you a favor <br>
    and it will probably mean some extra work for you, but you're the <br>
    only one who can help a fellow new student. Your file reads that you <br>
    speak fluent Farsi, is this true?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Yes sir, we speak it at home.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Well,&quot; he began. &quot;I'd like you to meet Mr. and
    Mrs. Williams and <br>
    their son Josh. He will be a sophomore here with us and this young <br>
    lady is Narisa Williams. She's just arrived here from Iran a few days <br>
    ago and doesn't speak any English yet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa and Zaara appeared to seemingly click instantly and smiled
    at <br>
    each other and began to speak in Farsi for a minute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa smiled and thought to herself, <i>She's awfully pretty and
    she <br>
    sure noticed Josh. I hope she doesn't have her eye on him or I might <br>
    have to claw her eyes out.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Hi!&quot; Zaara said to Narisa, &quot;How old are you? What
    grade are you <br>
    in?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Hi!&quot; Narisa replied. &quot;I'm thirteen and starting
    the ninth grade, just <br>
    like you. You don't know how relieved I am to meet another girl that <br>
    speaks Farsi. I think we'll be taking all the same classes and I hope <br>
    we can be good friends!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Me too! I think we're alike in too many ways. I think we can
    become<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><i>very </i>good friends. I just have a
    feeling. I'm so happy to have a Farsi <br>
    speaking friend. English is okay, but it's more natural to speak our <br>
    native tongue, don't you think?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Praise Allah! Finally, <i>someone</i> who understands
    completely. I can't <br>
    tell you how happy I am to meet you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Zaara thought, <i>She reminds me of myself when I first came here
     <br>
    scared to death.</i> then she said, &quot;We'll have soooo much fun this
    year, <br>
    I can tell all ready.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>As Marie translated what they were talking about to Josh, Zaara
    turned <br>
    surprised and asked her if she spoke Farsi also. Marie revealed that <br>
    both she and Steve were fluent, but that Josh wasn't. Marie then took <br>
    over the conversation by asking Zaara, &quot;What sect if Islam does your <br>
    family practice?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;We are Shi'ite Muslims like Narisa I presume?&quot; Narisa
    beamed a <br>
    bright smile and nodded vigorously. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Yes she is. How old are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Fourteen. My birthday is in January so I had to wait a year
    to start <br>
    school.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>When she said &quot;birthday&quot;, Josh suddenly remembered that <i>his
    </i><br>
    birthday was the following week. With all that had happened during <br>
    the past month he'd completely forgotten about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Zaara,&quot; Mr. Henry cut in, &quot;what I'd like you to do
    is to be a mentor <br>
    to Narisa. You and she would attend the same classes and you would <br>
    translate and help her get familiar with school and life here in <br>
    America. Is this something that you might be interested in doing? I <br>
    must warn you that this will require more work from you because <br>
    you'd not only have to do your own work, but you'd also have to help <br>
    Narisa with hers. Do you think you're up to the challenge?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Oh yes sir! I'd love a girlfriend I can speak Farsi with! I
    can tell <br>
    we're going to be very good friends already! My parents would be <br>
    overjoyed that I had such a friend. We are kind of isolated in that we <br>
    generally only get to speak our native tongue with other Muslims at <br>
    Mosque.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Zaara,&quot; Marie interrupted, &quot;now that you have said
    that you'd like to <br>
    help Narisa and it appears that the two of you seem to have hit it off, <br>
    there's something you need to know. This is private and you cannot <br>
    reveal this to <i>anyone</i> at school. This is very personal and could <br>
    cause Narisa, Josh, and the school serious problems if it ever got out <br>
    - not to mention our family - so this is very serious. Can you keep a <br>
    secret?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Yes ma'am, but I cannot hide the truth from my
    parents.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;We completely understand this and you won't have to.&quot;
    Marie <br>
    reassured. &quot;In fact, we'd like to invite your family to dinner this <br>
    evening and discuss your new friendship with Narisa and Josh. Can <br>
    you call them and see if it's possible?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Yes ma'am. My parents gave me a cell phone as a present for <br>
    entering high school. I can call them on my lunch break.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Good. Do you have any siblings?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Yes, maam. A sister, Kamya. She's a sophomore here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;She was the sophomore girl I had in the one folder; I didn't
    know <br>
    you two were related.&quot; Mr. Henry put in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;There's no other way to say this except to come right out
    with it. <br>
    Zaara -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Zaara cut Marie off saying, &quot;I think I already know what
    you're going <br>
    to say, Mrs. Williams. Narisa and Josh are married. Am I right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;How'd you guess <i>that</i>?&quot; Josh asked surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Alternating looks between Narisa and Josh with a knowing smile she
    <br>
    answered, &quot;Because you both have the same last names and she's <br>
    sitting rather close to you to be an adopted sister.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;You, my dear,&quot; Marie countered, &quot;are a <i>very</i>
    observant girl. Narisa <br>
    and Josh were married in Tehran about a month ago. They are <br>
    husband and wife, have a real marriage and live as a married <br>
    couple.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Zaara's eyes got a sparkle in them and she smiled widely as she <br>
    looked at Narisa then Josh and giggled with a hand-covered mouth. <br>
    She turned to Narisa and they began chattering a mile a minute in <br>
    Farsi while Zaara was giving Narisa an astonished and excited look. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Insha Allah!&quot; Zaara exclaimed. &quot;You're really
    married? I mean, oh <br>
    my gosh, you two actually sleep together and do all that married <br>
    stuff. You know sex stuff?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Narisa answered with a proud smiling nod.
    &quot;We haven't <br>
    done it all the way yet because of my stupid period, but yeah, we've <br>
    done a few things. We really shouldn't be talking about this stuff <br>
    now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Oh yeah, right.&quot; Zaara agreed. &quot;Sorry if I got too
    personal. It's just <br>
    that it's hard to believe your parents allowed you to marry so young, <br>
    that's all. If some boy asked my father for my hand today, he'd be run <br>
    out of the neighborhood with a shotgun, I'd be grounded for life and <br>
    probably be spanked black and blue to boot!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;It's a long story. I'll tell you later, okay?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Okay, I can't <i>wait</i> to hear your story.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa thought, <i>She may be okay after all. She identifies with
    me, <br>
    didn't look at Josh while we spoke and seemed genuinely interested <br>
    in <b>me.</b> Maybe I can trust her after all.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Marie and Steve started chuckling and when Josh asked what was <br>
    going on, his mother just replied, &quot;Girl talk.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>When the girls had finished their little chat, Zaara turned and
    said, &quot;I <br>
    can fully understand how this could cause problems. The other kids <br>
    wouldn't understand some of our customs and Narisa and Josh <br>
    might become the subject of terrible gossip and teasing. I will keep <br>
    this between my family and myself. They won't reveal your secret.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Marie pulled out a pad and wrote her name and cell number on it <br>
    and gave it to Zaara saying, &quot;When you talk to your parents about <br>
    dinner tonight, please have one of them call me so we can finalize the <br>
    details.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Okay not a problem, Mrs. Williams. Mr. Henry, would I start <br>
    tomorrow with Narisa?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;No.&quot; Marie interjected.&quot; We have an appointment at
    court <br>
    tomorrow. Josh and Narisa will start classes on Wednesday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Thank you for your help, Zaara. You can return to class
    now,&quot; Mr. <br>
    Henry said. &quot;I will have someone show you where Narisa's locker is <br>
    so that you two can meet before homeroom on Wednesday. Is that <br>
    okay with you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; she replied. Switching to Farsi she
    said, &quot;I'm so <br>
    happy to be your friend and mentor Narisa. I hope to see you at <br>
    dinner tonight, okay? I hope Mom and Dad will say yes. Bye, <br>
    Narisa.&quot; Zaara said with a cute smile. Switching to English, she said,
    <br>
    &quot;Bye Josh. Maybe I'll see you again at dinner tonight.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Bye, Zaara,&quot; he answered. &quot;That would be really
    cool.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa nodded and the two girls, Josh's parents and he exchanged <br>
    salaams, then she departed for class with sparkling eyes and an <br>
    infectious smile. Mr. Henry then stood up and offered to take the <br>
    Williams family for a tour of the campus. He took his master book <br>
    with him and during the tour, directed Narisa and Josh to several <br>
    empty lockers midway between the two buildings that were side-by-<br>
    side and wrote them in his book as being assigned. With class <br>
    schedules and locker locations in hand, the Williams said their <br>
    goodbyes to Mr. Henry and thanked him for all his help. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>All of the Williams felt a sense of relief that Narisa wouldn't
    have to <br>
    struggle through her first school year alone and the fact that she and <br>
    Zaara seemed to have clicked as friends right away was a definite <br>
    plus. That relief wasn't more evident than the look on Narisa's face <br>
    and the sparkle in her eyes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>God, I could get lost in those eyes!</span></i><span
    style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>
    Josh thought with pride.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>There was also that unspoken relief between the two teen spouses <br>
    that they didn't have to hide their true relationship from their new <br>
    friend. They now had one new friend in a fledgling, very small circle <br>
    that they could, for the time being, be completely open with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
