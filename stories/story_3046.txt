<p>A love note</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
tension<br>
Mind and body just dont see eye to eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I long for the visit that will expand my understanding of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To sit and talk about the things that interest you, that revolt you, the
passions of your former life and the goals of your future, these are dainties
that feed the admiration and interest of my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Would you rather see me in a suit or casual clothing, (and I can tell you
whether I like you in a dress or skirt and blouse or in short pants) longer or
shorter hair, and how do you feel about moustaches?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These are tension enough for my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I feed off your opinions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
it is your voice that I consume, knowing by ear that you spend your energy on me
and the exercise of intellect is for my benefit.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">My
eyes betray me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No sooner do I see
you than I recuse my brain from the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
heart (O base betrayer and crooked guide!) takes the bench and rules the
courtroom of my actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I begin to
see you in parts of a whole and that excites me beyond rational horizons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no perceptible boundary that I pass to come to this, it is as
though it has always been this way, and my memories of our discussions of work
and theory and style have all been about the bodies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The automatic transmission, super-glide as it were, of my transition is
startling to you at times, but welcomed as you gather me into your arms for the
first sweet kiss.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">These
parts, so exceptional, are meant for me, and I inventory each one, holding it up
to my scrutiny as one might hold up the rarest gem to sunlight, with pleasure
laughing at his fortune to have such pricelessness in his grasp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
Inventory<br>
Eyes:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eyes that sparkle and hint of
interest  note I do not say desire, though that be more than contained in
interest, indeed is the color of it  they search my own for signs that my
thoughts might be different than the last time they looked, or the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These eyes that look at me through kisses and caresses, to seekwhat?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If approval, you have it, if messages, only in my mans code can I
respond, in fear? I think not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
desire then, that I might read the passionate desire behind them and find in the
code the perfect response that will explode the bloom of life and the allow you
to manifest the expression of your sexual being.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Lips:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not the sole province of our physical connection, but the primary spot
most surely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It all begins at your
lips, and there it is sweetest because these similar organs of our desire have
such close tastes, and I know I will go from and come back to these no matter
whether I stray to top of your head or soles of your feet and my lips will be
welcome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Ears:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They hear my cries and you respond with lips and hands and body to
fulfill my longing needs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The art of penetration begins here and sends the unqualified
message of desire to all parts of your body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So choice and delicate, they caution me to careful caress more often than
to unabashed consumption, yet there are no guarantees.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Neck:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That which is only mine in passing, with graceful curve of soft inviting
flesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That I have put my mouths
tattoo my mouth on this zone of sensitivity and seen you walk among men is
plenty to stoke the coals of my desire to full flame by but thinking of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I would, as the thieves of the old west, take his brand and alter it
subtly to mark this district as mine, if only for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And your neck, it leads to your breast<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Breast:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That which is life-giving and softest north of your naval Ive often
torn and rampaged over, bringing the heights of sensation and the depths of
redness and sensitivity. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>For this I regret, but only after the damage is done to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Youve made me pay of late, with comparable ministrations that I feel
over time and am reminded of my selfish folly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yet I did not come to talk of this, but of the beauty and delicious
flavor that the buds of your breast provide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A place for me to sharpen my teeth on  but no, Ill stop that and
focus on kneading the sweetness of them to my mouth and be a barbarian no more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the soft white curve of the body that holds the nipple  I still
find imaginary grains of honey sugar on these as I gently lick in circles ever
widening and contracting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No such
taste is found if I tear into these and gnaw the yielding flesh, but a flavor
but no less intoxicating is loosed by stronger ministrations.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I
can not go on right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My heart
pounds and my soul yearns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My head
is filled and has no room for more of this, nor work or other intercourse with
my peers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now in my mind only the
vision that I paint that you would not recognize for its terrible beauty, my
vision of you.<o:p>
