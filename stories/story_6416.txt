This little piece by PlanetDweller is one of his most curious ones because 
its his shortest and is one hundred percent autobiographical except for 
changing the names. Its based on a real life incident that involved a lady 
that he and his then-first wife were having an affair with. I got to meet 
this third person when they, Planet and his wife, invited me over for steaks 
on the grill at their house one Saturday evening. Linda knew of my mutual 
friendship with the PD and wife and I think she was as curious about me as I 
was about her. PDs wife was very bisexual really more than anything but who 
just happened to be hopelessly in love with him, he always allowing her to 
have her girlfriends on the side, he didnt care, always told me he thought him 
doing so actually strengthened his marriage. All during dinner the vibe was just 
plain weird and it made me feel uncomfortable. Linda never stopped drolling and 
it wasnt over the food, the steaks being as good as they were. 

They had met Linda through an old-style two line dial-in BBS/Bulletin Board System 
called, and I couldnt make this up if I tried, GLIE pronounced Glee like the 
TV show for Gay and Lesbian Information Exchange based in nearby Durham. They saw 
that she was online, pinged her and began to flirt with her, remember this was 
way before the Internet and all, and within a week they were having a full-blown 
triad affair with her that lasted for months until the weight of Lindas drama 
and their not knowing how to cope with it blew it all up, she basically making 
no bones about wanting PDs wife to leave him for her and the two of them set up 
housekeeping together and his wife flat out refusing to do so and when that 
didnt happen she made their life a true living hell, Linda trying to drag his 
wife more than him into her (Lindas) on-going nasty divorce from her own husband 
and, and you get the idea. While not the only factor in Planet & Wifes eventual 
divorce from their twenty year marriage, the chaos that Linda brought into their 
lives was definitely heavily contributory for it.

Planet could tell I was never quite comfortable being there so he being who he 
is made a gesture of good will Ill always remember. Dinner through, he simply 
said, lets all retire to the bedroom.

He and wife were never really swingers and he and I had talked about in fantasy 
terms certain possibilities but quite frankly I didnt want any drama either 
so as Linda and wife climbed into their giant 6x7 california king waterbed 
and got naked as quick as they could, he pulled me up a chair with a lets watch 
but I told him I preferred to stand. Then for the next good hour or so I watched 
the two women not just have real-life lesbian sex not inches away from me but 
with a passion and intensity that was truly beyond anything I had ever seen in 
porno flicks or otherwise could have imagined. The two of them were truly in 
love with each other and didnt care that a total stranger, me, was feeding off 
their energy from the sidelines as was PeeDee too but he had been there and done 
that and got the teeshirts many times so he wasnt quite as enthralled with 
all as I was. After about an hour he then took off his own clothes and joined 
them without inviting me but that was just fine, my feelings werent hurt one bit, 
and after another half an hour or so of watching the three bodies medusa together 
I actually became a little bored and quietly made my exit. He and I to this very 
day have yet to speak of what happened that night, Im still glad he trusted me 
enough to ask me to be there, and about six months later he wrote and published 
this story below about he and Linda having a lovers moment at the hospital. 
I hope you enjoy it. ~ ~ ~ AlphaBettaFish, curator of PlanetDweller's story archive

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi Suzy,

I really enjoyed chatting with you last night, hope
you enjoyed chatting with me as well. It's so nice to
have a "biological female" friend (i.e., a nice lady who is
one in RL and isn't a guy pretending to be a girl
online) who shares my interest in periods and such.
I'm looking forward to hearing the whole story about
"your Linda" that you mentioned briefly last night but
was too tired to relate. 

Oh, that was/is okay, telling me you were/are tired
and don't feel like chatting, I work long hours too,
sometimes 12-14-16 hours a day at times, and know how
you feel when you're just too tired to feel erotic
and/or plain ol' horny.

I am looking forward to hearing the whole story about
Linda maybe next time we connect and you have more
time and energy.

About "my" Linda. My first wife and I met "our" Linda online
in 1993, on an old-fashioned pre-web dial-in BBS
(computer bulletin board system). She had separated
from her husband and was discovering her lesbian side.


She was just 4'11" and 100 lbs. Now, my first wife was
5'10" and 150 lbs and I was/am 6'4"/250 lbs., so you
can imagine what we three must have looked like in
public, arm-in-arm, all three of us obviously in love
with each other and making no bones about it. It was
funny.

Suzy's, yes my first wife was also named Suzy, Suzy
Mae to be exact, Suzy's old lover before she and I
got together who almost "married" us several times
over a 15 year period, Barbara, I think I might have
mentioned her, had broken up with us that previous
January, and coincidentally, maybe not, Linda was a
virtual carbon copy of Barbara.

I mentioned one thing last night about Suzy pulling
Linda's tampon out with her teeth before going down on
her. I saw that several times in the June-September
"romance" we three had. They weren't "synched", which
meant there was a 50% chance at any given moment that
one of them would be menstruating that day during our
play, which was nice.

I didn't tell you about something that happened with
Linda and I. I'll tell you the short version now, it's
almost 8AM and I have to get to work, but I'll tell
you the longer version in chat another time.

Linda had 2-3 serious medical conditions, one of them
terminal. As part of the treatment of one of them, she
had to have an operation in the July of our summer
romance. I can't remember what the operation was for,
but it  -was-  major. She was in the hospital for a
week afterwards. 

Now, my Suzy hated hospitals with a
passion, and I didn't particularly care for them
either. But I was in love with Linda as well as Suzy,
so each day while she was there I'd go see her, at
least once per day.

Linda had started her period just before the operation
and was for some reason embarrassed about it. I told
her not to worry, like her doctors and all hadn't seen
women patients having periods all the time. Keep in
mind this was a 31-year-old woman with two daughters
ages 9 and 11 then.

Anyway, as she was wheeled into the recovery room, I
was there. I simply had told them my name, and was
allowed to go in. I hadn't told them the nature of our
relationship, it was none of their business.

After 3-4 hours of semi-grogginess, Linda started
coming around to where she recognized me. About that
time, a recovery room nurse came in with a fresh
hospital-style belted Kotex, the kind they use on you
after childbirth etc.

The nurse looked at me and shoved the Kotex towards
me. I gave her a look like "what the hell do you want
me to do with it?". She slightly scowled at me, shoved
the pad into my hand, and barked "well, you're her
husband aren't you? I thought you'd want to change her
yourself."

Aaaahhhhh. What can I say. Linda smiled. No, even
though still very groggy, she started laughing so hard
the nurse told her to stop for fear her guffawing
would pop her stitches.

"Oh, I'll do it, Mr. Schwartz (the last name of her soon
to be ex-husband) if you want."

"No, that's okay, she is my wife, I don't mind" I
replied as Linda continued to just crack up as her
eyes fought the remaining effects of what was left of
the anesthesia.

I kissed Linda on the lips as I lifted her hospital
gown up. This was a recovery room, a very public place
in its own way. I didn't care. I kissed her fully for
a couple of minutes and felt her up as well before my
hand found her Kotex'd pussy and I played with the
thin residue clinging to her lips.

"Need to change you, Dear, nurse's orders."

She cracked up again. We kissed a little more.

Then, in one of the most erotic experiences of my
life, I unhooked the now-drenched old-fashioned belted
hospital Kotex from its holster and tossed it in the
trashcan before going over to the lavatory next to the
bed and rinsing a washcloth out in warm water and
cleaning her blood-stained pussy up a bit. 

And yes,
with nurses and doctors and all flitting all around us
as they walked in and out of the recovery room, I
planted one quick but very firm kiss squarely on her
still-pinkish-from-blood vagina, which definitely got
the last of the effects of the anesthesia out of her
system as she arched bark, sucked in her breath for
one second with a "stop, Honey, there's too many people
around". I can be such a stinker at times,
heheheheheee.

Then, in a perfect ballet of menstrual eroticism, I
fiddled with the ends of the 40's-style Kotex and,
moving the belt around the make it easier to hook the
paper tabs through the stamped-sheet-metal
hook-thingy(I had never played with one of these kind
before, keep in mind) for the back one and then
adjusting the belt did the same for the front one,
pulling it snug as I did, kissing her as my hand once
again slipped between fresh pad and leaking pussy.

"Mr. Schwartz, please, this is a public place, please!"
her nurse now back barked at me "she'll be home soon,
you can, uuhhhh, you can resume marital relations
after her doctor says it's permissible."

"I'm sorry" I replied facetiously "it won't happen
again, I just love her so much" which was a very true
statement.

"It better not. Her doctor will be here shortly, you
can discuss things with him then."

Making sure the coast was clear for a moment, my
fingers once again slipped between pad and into her
pussy as her G-spot was worked the way I knew she
loved me to do and she quickly came as we kissed and
kissed some more. Taking my fingers out after she came
and had added her cyprine fluid to the mix of it and
blood, we shared her essence smeared on my fingers like
a primal ambrosia.

"We had better stop now, Dear, or we'll get in
trouble" she whispered as she finished licking her
pink off my hand, sucking each finger in turn like a
little cock, making me come in my pants to the point
where my semen stained through my khakis.

"Uh,,,,uh,,,,uh-hu" was all I could grunt in reply.

Holding her close in a hug, my hand pulled her gown
down over her naked lower half as it slipped beneath
it to rest happily between pad and pussy, lightly
caressing. A moment of erotic perfection not planned
and probably never to be quite duplicated in my
lifetime again.

Anyway, Suzy, I didn't mean to write the above as a
full-blown story, I just wanted to tell you about this
since we were talking about your Linda and my Linda
last night a little. My word as a gentleman that every
single word above is 100% true to best recollection of
my memory. I hope you enjoyed reading it, and hope
your panties are just about drenched  -from-  reading
it (G)!

Damn. What a memory. I hadn't thought about it in
years, until you mentioned your Linda last night. I
think I'll change the names and post it on my website
over at ASSTR. Especially since it's completely true,
it's too good not to share with my readers. The story
above was written for you, specifically, Suzy, and I
hope you don't mind me sharing it with the world. Let
me know if you mind; like I say, I promise to change
all our names to keep us anonymous. Thanks, you're a
true buddie.

Well, it's almost 8:30, I  -have- to get to work, I
didn't mean to get myself all excited on this early
Monday morning by putting the above to paper, but
that's my own fault I suppose. Have a good day, my
friend, and we'll meet in chat soon, Yours, HoneyBunch
