From the pen of Dr. John H. Watson: In which Holmes and Watson play fast and loose with the laws of the land.

Chapter 6: The Jewels of Tarpeia

"He wishes me to steal the Jewels of Tarpeia," Holmes said.

Jeeves inhaled sharply through his nose. The name clearly had meaning to him, although it had none for me. The provenance of these mysterious jewels, however, was of less concern to me than the risky action Holmes was planning to take to acquire them.

"Good Heavens, Holmes, you agreed?" I asked, horrified. I could scarce credit it, but Holmes's affirmation at the end of the telephone conversation could hardly imply anything else.

"I agreed, but that does not mean that I must follow through. I agreed in order to buy us time." He curled up on the settee and stared into the distance. "I need to consider my options."

"What of Mr. Wooster?" Jeeves queried, breaking into Holmes's reverie. Indeed, the question was a most pertinent one, as I didn't doubt that Mr. Wooster would come to harm if Holmes tried to renege on his deal with Roberson.

"What of him?" Holmes replied.

Jeeves's face took on a countenance as stiff and blank as marble. I, too, was aghast at Holmes's display of callousness. As much as I feared for Holmes, I knew that he was made of stern stuff and possessed ample skills of self-preservation. Mr. Wooster, however, with his easy nature and general trust in the basic goodness of mankind, had all the self-preservatory instincts of a naïve child. The idea of leaving him in Roberson's clutches to fend for himself was intolerable. I said as much to Holmes. "Mr. Wooster's life is at stake! Surely we must take that into consideration."

"I am considering all the variables."

"He's not a variable, Holmes. He's an innocent young man who has never faced this sort of danger before. We have a duty to protect him."

"What would you have me do?" Holmes snarled. "Become Roberson's lackey? If I play his game, dance to his tune, then he wins."

Jeeves cleared his throat with a delicate cough. His voice was smooth and his expression unreadable save for a glitter in his eyes. "Would you allow your client to be murdered, sir? Surely such an event would be a blot on your record."

"Mr. Wooster is not my client."

"Then I will employ you on his behalf."

"I'm retired. I no longer accept clients."

I perceived Jeeves's strategy, and threw my lot in with him. "You know that's not entirely true, Holmes. You cleared up the death of that science master."

"He died right in front of me; what else was I to do?"

"There was also the affair of Mr. Wiseman's missing painting just last year."

"A favour for a close neighbour."

"'Close neighbour?'" I scoffed. "His house is ten miles away and he's even more unsociable than you are! You yourself admitted that you knew little about him; before the incident you'd only spoken to him once in all the years you've lived in the district."

"A neighbour regardless," Holmes waved his delicate hand dismissively, as if he were swatting away a gnat.

"And don't forget the time you saved that poor girl from the cruelty of her step-father."

"It was a heinous thing to do to a child. Any man with a shred of decency would have acted as I did under the circumstances."

"Nobody else could have acted as you did, Holmes. You barely slept for two weeks, gathering evidence and concocting a method to put him in gaol where he belonged without bringing shame on the mother or child. And there were the Rhondda Valley murders that were all over the press in '07. Then there was that hideous time you dragged us both to Scotland in January to assist the Edinburgh police. And that government fraud case that Mycroft brought to your attention. And the outlandish experience with the travelling carnival, which still gives me nightmares upon occasion. And-"

"Enough, Watson." He raised his hands, whether in surrender or to hold off the onslaught I was not sure. Either way, I had made my point. I settled into silence, knowing well after my many years with him when to push and when to retreat. As I expected, my patience was rewarded. When he spoke, it was quietly but with more candour than I had heard from him in a long time. "I have always valued justice; more than anything else in this world, justice is what makes existence bearable. One can live-perhaps happily, perhaps not-without faith, without temperance, without love, without freedom, but take away justice and all falls into disorder and the world tears itself apart. If ever I broke the letter of the law, it was because justice is more important than any man-made decree. What Roberson asks of me is nothing less than a perversion of my skills, using them to betray what I hold dear. What justice is there in violating the home of an innocent person? What justice is there in abetting a criminal in amassing ill-gotten wealth?"

I sat beside him on the settee and laid my hand upon his shoulder. It was hard as steel beneath my grip. It grieved me to see his distress, all the more for my own part in causing it. If I had not written those private accounts, if I had argued on Mr. Wooster's behalf and convinced him to flee to safety and leave Roberson to us, if I had been able to shoot Roberson before his shot clipped my head and left me in a daze…fault after fault stretched out behind me like footprints. Weighed down with sorrow, I could not speak. Jeeves, however, had no such guilt to contend with, nor concern for Holmes's comfort of mind.

"What justice is there, sir, in allowing Mr. Wooster to suffer for the sake of your pride?" he asked. Holmes flinched under my hand, although his face did not show the sting that I knew Jeeves's words had evoked.

Cutting as the remark was, it roused Holmes from his introspection. After Holmes's initial shock, he gathered his resolve, straightening in his seat, his cool grey eyes sharpening their focus as his thoughts returned from whatever disquieting inner landscapes they had been wandering.

"Just so," Holmes said. Once the matter was decided, Holmes threw himself into the task whole-heartedly, as was his wont. He sprang from the settee and fluttered about the room, punctuating his words with graceful gestures of his fine hands. "I shall need information and I shall need it quickly. Roberson has given me until Monday night to accomplish the task-a woefully inadequate amount of time, but I must make do with what I have. I shall require both of you to assist in the preliminary research."

"I am more than happy to assist you, as always, but if I'm to help, I'll first need some information myself." I gathered my thoughts in order. "First, the Jewels of Tarpeia. I confess, I've never heard of them. What are they? Gemstones of some sort?"

"The Jewels of Tarpeia are pieces of ancient Etruscan jewellery," Holmes answered, "a diadem and collar set, made of gold and inlaid with cabochons of black garnet. The set is priceless, not only for its material value but its antiquity."

Jeeves added, "They are owned by Lady Elizabeth de Glanville, and she considers them to be among her prize possessions, wearing them for only the most extravagant of occasions and otherwise keeping them locked away in a safe." Now that Holmes was following the desired course of action, Jeeves's mask was less cold, and he was once again the epitome of the helpful valet. The shift was smooth and near imperceptible and I was forced to reassess my initial opinions of the man. His intelligence and devotion were self-evident, but I had hitherto failed to recognize his talent for manipulation. Never before had I seen Holmes so skilfully turned from his initial course with merely a few words, and apparently without Holmes aware that he was being herded.

"You are familiar with the lady's habits?" Holmes asked, fixing his rapt attention on Jeeves.

"Yes, sir. One of my second cousins was a footman for the household for many years until he recently married. At that point, he decided to take a position in the country as he believed it would be better for the prospective children."

"Go on," Holmes waved for Jeeves to continue. "What else can you tell me?"

"Very little, sir. Only that the family keeps two dogs loose in the yard at night-large, black brutes-and that the house itself is fitted with electric burglar alarms at all the doors and windows. The safe in which Lady Elizabeth keeps her jewels is in her boudoir, which is directly adjacent to her bedroom. It is hidden in the wall behind a small Rembrandt."

"Good Lord," I said. "you know everything but the combination of the safe!"

"Alas, I cannot help you there, sir."

"No matter," Holmes replied. "Cracking the safe will be the easiest part of my task. I will need tools, however. Mr. Jeeves, would you be so kind as to have our luggage sent here from the James Hotel near Victoria Station?"

"Yes, sir." Jeeves left the flat to make the arrangements with the doorman.

I gave Holmes a quizzical look. "You brought safe cracking equipment with you?"

"I anticipated the possibility that I'd be required to break into Roberson's rooms to retrieve the papers. I certainly didn't expect to use them for common crime."

"I dare say there's nothing 'common' about this whole affair."

Holmes's lips tightened in a grim smile. "I plan to make this business appear as common and ordinary as can be, so that there is no clue, no irregularity, which can be traced. The investigative powers of the Metropolitan police may not be much, but it's better not to take unnecessary risks."

Jeeves returned. "A man has been sent to fetch the luggage. Shall I prepare a bedroom for you, gentlemen?"

"For Watson, perhaps, but not for me. I'm going out." Holmes said. "I don't expect I'll be back before breakfast."

"What can I do?" I asked.

"For now, nothing. Rest. Tomorrow, first, go directly to Cox and Co. and find out if Roberson does indeed have the papers or is merely bluffing. If the papers are still in your dispatch box, retrieve them, bring them back here and burn them immediately. After you have accomplished that, go to the surveyors' office and get me as many blueprints for the house and its surrounds that you can. Oh, and stop by the chemist's and purchase some morphine."

My jaw slackened and my eyebrows shot up. After many years of effort, I had for the most part weaned him from his addictions, although there were still the occasional slips. But even during those times when he was most captivated by the poison, he had never once succumbed to the temptation of the needle while on a case.

Holmes rolled his eyes. "For the dogs, Watson, for the dogs." With that final statement, Holmes slipped into his coat, dropped his homburg on his head and whisked himself away out the door and onto the London streets.

Jeeves led me to the guest room and saw me settled in for the night. After a few scant hours of lonely and restless sleep, I rose early to face what was sure to be a busy day. The wet, smoky scent of bacon and the sweetness of buttered toast wafted through the air. No sooner had I taken my seat in the dining room than Jeeves arrived with a cup of tea and a marvellous breakfast.

Although I'd always lived comfortably enough and had little to complain about regarding the state of my finances, the services of a valet were a bit of a novelty. Mrs. Hudson, God rest her soul, had never been so smooth and efficient in her housekeeping or quiet in her comings and goings. Jeeves, on the other hand, was so silent that it was easy to forget that he was there, a remarkable feat for a man who was broad in the shoulder and taller even than Holmes. His face rarely betrayed a hint of emotion, yet it was clear from his actions last night that he was deeply devoted to his master, the kind-hearted Mr. Wooster, and that encouraged me to be well disposed towards him despite the fact that I knew little of him.

I thought of the distress that had slipped out last night from under his professional mask when Mr. Wooster's safety was on the line. I understood well the sort of emotions that must be stirring beneath, having witnessed them in many a client and having experienced such fear myself. Sympathy compelled me to offer hope. "Holmes will get him back, you'll see. He'll get the jewels, make the exchange, and Mr. Wooster will be returned safe and sound before you know it."

"As you say, sir," Jeeves replied, his face as still and unmoving as before. He showed no flicker of either concern or confidence.

I didn't know what I expected-a visible relaxation of features, a glint of optimism in the eyes-but there was no sign that my words had affected him in the least manner. Jeeves's expression was completely impenetrable. Either he cared less about his master than I supposed, although my memory of last night dismissed that possibility, or else his feelings were even more obfuscated than Holmes's. I left him to his privacy, then, and said no more.

As soon as I finished my tea, I left to carry out the errands with which Holmes had tasked me the night before. Jeeves offered to take care of the matter of the surveyors' office, arguing that the task required a great deal of discretion, lest it be tracked to the soon-to-be burglary, and that he had certain connections that would help him.

I was at the doors of Cox and Co. the moment they opened for the day. My dispatch box was still in the vault, but the compromising papers themselves were no longer inside. I could not report the theft, for the ruckus that would incite would prompt difficult questions and, furthermore, would interfere with Holmes's plans. Nevertheless, I casually probed the staff and discovered that jokes about the bank being haunted had been bandied about over the last few weeks. It started when a clerk swore that he had seen a shadow in the dark corridor to the vault. He went to investigate, but no intruder was found, and nothing was ever reported missing, so the whole event was dismissed as a young man's overactive imagination and the Tale of the Haunted Vault was born.

After I had completed my business with the bank, I dropped by the chemist's on my way back to Berkeley Square. Acquiring the drug was a simple task, made doubly so by my medical credentials.

By eleven o'clock, a bottle of morphine sat on the table next to the flower vase, and a neat stack of blueprints competed for space with the morning Times. Despite Holmes's assurances that he would be back after breakfast, there was still no sign of him and I began to worry. It had been many years since he had spent much time in London, and there were a thousand ways an elderly gentleman walking the streets alone at night might come to peril. Although Holmes still possessed his wiry strength and kept himself fit with long walks and frequent swims in the ocean when the weather permitted, he was not as robust as he had been in his younger years, loath though he was to admit it. The image of a young hooligan with a knife murdering Holmes for his pocketbook lodged itself in my mind and refused to be shaken out. When the telephone rang, I started, roused from my unpleasant reverie. Jeeves answered the phone.

"Mr. Wooster's residence...No, Lady Worplesdon, I regret to say that he is not available...No, he is not sleeping off the effects of too much drink...He has left the house for the day...Yes, Lady Worplesdon." The call ended.

I raised my brows in inquiry. Jeeves replied. "That was one of Mr. Wooster's relatives. She was hoping to have a word with him today."

"You didn't tell her the truth?"

"I thought it highly imprudent to do so, sir. Roberson was quite explicit in his views regarding police involvement, and Lady Worplesdon is not one to sit idly by while strangers manage affairs. She would insist on calling Scotland Yard."

"It still seems a bit unfair that she remain ignorant of the danger her own kin is facing. If she knew the truth, she'd be worried sick."

Jeeves's mouth twitched in scepticism. From this I gathered that there was no love lost between Mr. Wooster and this relative of his, nor did Jeeves think highly of her.

We spoke no more to each other through lunch, save for idle pleasantries. Just as Jeeves was clearing the luncheon plates, Holmes burst into the flat. He looked every inch like a man who had spent the night prowling the backstreets of London, all stubbled cheek, wrinkled clothes, dishevelled hair and red, sunken eyes. His palms of his hands were scraped raw and his fingernails cracked and filthy.

"Where in heaven's name have you been, Holmes? And what have you been doing to put yourself in such a state?"

Holmes ignored my questions. "Damn Roberson and his unreasonable demands! A clever burglar would observe the house for weeks before making a move. He would learn the house and its routine; he would take note of the layout; he would determine the obstacles and prepare methods for overcoming each one in turn; he would-"

"Court the maidservant?" I said tartly.

"Are you still bitter about that old deception?"

Holmes was not the only one who could ignore direct questions. "You were at the de Glanville house, then."

"For part of the night, yes," Holmes replied. "It is just as Mr. Jeeves said. Two dogs, a lawn girded by a stone wall about seven feet high. There are twelve servants in all. The lady, her husband, and their three young children are all currently staying in the house." Holmes sighed. "This is not going to be easy. Did you get the blueprints?"

"Jeeves did." I pointed to the stack. Holmes snatched them up and rifled through them, nodding his approval.

"Excellent." He strew them about the sitting room floor with seeming abandon. Jeeves shuddered at the chaos. "The street." He waved his hand over one section of paper-covered floor. "The house." His hand fluttered again in the opposite direction. He sat down Indian-style on the rug and shuffled through the blueprints, occasionally marking them up with a short pencil.

When the doorbell rang, Holmes did not appear to notice, so thoroughly engrossed he was in his task. My first thought was that the police were back, and I instinctively hurried to where Holmes sat, thinking to hide the blueprints, although there were far too many, and too scattered to gather them all up quickly enough to do any good. When reason reasserted itself, I reckoned that it was something quite innocuous, a friend of Mr. Wooster's, or a delivery. Either way, standing in the middle of the room looking shifty was not the ideal action to take. I settled myself on the chair, mimicking Holmes's lack of concern.

Jeeves glided to the door. On the other side was a formidable looking woman of near my own age. "Lady Worplesdon," Jeeves began.

She burst past him and into the sitting room. "I will accept no excuses, Jeeves. Where is that good-for-nothing nephew of mine? And don't tell me he is 'unavailable'; I know an evasion when I hear one." She stopped in her tracks when her eyes fell on the scene before her. She frowned at me as I politely rose to my feet, but when she saw Holmes her expression turned to open distaste as she took in his unkempt guise.

"Who the devil are you?" She looked at Holmes. Holmes opened his mouth to reply, but was interrupted before he could speak. "Don't bother to answer. I can see clearly that you're one of those bohemian dilettantes-some sort of so-called 'artist' or 'philosopher'. I know your type, parasites always sniffing about well-off gentlemen, grasping for handouts, decrying money one second then gleefully snatching it up the next. You've been filling Bertie's head with all kinds of silly nonsense, no doubt. Well, I'll have none of it. Where is my nephew?"

Holmes was shocked into silence. It wasn't often that a person-and a woman, at that-dismissed him so thoroughly and completely. Even the mildest of women left him unsettled, although he always took great pains to conceal it. This mortal Tisiphone was far from the mildest of women.

"Lady Worplesdon," Jeeves tried again.

"Where is Bertie, Jeeves?" she asked. "And who are these men?"

"Well, you see, my lady-" I began, hardly knowing what I was going to say, but sure that one of us ought to say something and Holmes was not volunteering for the task.

"Mr. Wooster is considering building a house," Jeeves interrupted. "He is with the contractor now, examining possible lots. Mr. Williams here is a surveyor, and Mr. Harris an architect. You have undoubtedly heard of Mr. Harris's work, mostly neo-Georgian inspired Art Nouveau designs. He is in high demand on the continent and Mr. Wooster was very fortunate to catch him between commissions."

"Of course I've heard of him! Who has not?" Despite her protestations, her eyes betrayed the nervousness of one who does not wish to be caught ignorant. "But why would Bertie need a house? He has no wife, no children; what does he plan to do with it?"

Jeeves gave a discreet cough. "Lady Worplesdon, I have reason to believe that Mr. Wooster hopes that his domestic circumstances will soon change."

Lady Worplesdon frowned in bewilderment. "Do you mean to say he's engaged? And he has not told me?"

"He is not yet affianced, my lady, but it is my impression that he plans to offer his pledge soon."

"Well, what kind of girl is she? And why hasn't he introduced her to the family? It's some frightfully unsuitable match, isn't it��"a waitress, or, heaven help us, a chorus girl, some uncultured, shrill female without a speck of good breeding in her, a gold-digging, dim-witted trollop. Bertie never did have good sense or taste. That must be why he's keeping it a great secret. Well, I shall put a stop to that."

"When he hears of your disapproval, my lady, I am sure he will abandon the idea."

Holmes broke into the conversation, his voice high-pitched and reedy with a hint of a Scottish accent. "I hope Mr. Wooster hasn't been wasting my time. I do have other clients."

Lady Worplesdon looked down her sharp nose at Holmes. "Mr. Harris, I assure you that far more esteemed people than you have had their time wasted by my nephew."

"My time is worth money. I expect to be compensated."

"I fail to see that you have done anything that warrants payment. Surely you don't expect to be paid for," she sneered, "sprawling about the ground like a heathen and looking at drawings. My young step-son could do that free of charge."

Holmes's lips tightened. I could not tell if his annoyance was part of the role he was playing or genuine. "How like a nob to clutch at your pocketbook as if you were destitute the second someone mentions money."

"How like a wastrel to demand a salary for lazing about."

I decided that the squabble had gone on for long enough, and would only get worse if I allowed it to continue. "Lady Worplesdon," I bowed. "We're very sorry for any inconvenience that Mr. Wooster may have caused by engaging our services. As soon as he returns we'll sort the matter out."

"Well," she sniffed, eyeing me up and down. "You at least have respectable manners. You might consider teaching them to your vulgar colleague." Lady Worplesdon allowed herself a slight softening of the lips that might have been a smile. Holmes snorted at the implication but thankfully said nothing.

As she was gathering herself to leave Jeeves spoke, "I shall tell Mr. Wooster that you inquired after him, my lady. He will be most distressed to have missed your visit."

"Tell him that I will expect to see him tomorrow," Lady Worplesdon stated.

"My lady, I'm afraid that Mr. Wooster is going to be in the country tomorrow. He has already made all the arrangements and cannot cancel on such short notice."

"Nevertheless, cancel it he will. I shall not be put off so my dolt of a nephew can waste time playing golf with his friends."

"It is a rather more serious matter than that, my lady. Your sister, Mrs. Travers, personally commanded Mr. Wooster to present himself at Brinkley Court tomorrow."

"What could Dahlia want with a dunce like Bertie?" Lady Worplesdon asked. She shook her greyed head. "I suppose they are well suited to each other. She's nearly as foolish as Bertie is. Very well. He is to take luncheon with me at my hotel the day after tomorrow, and not a second later."

"I will ensure that he does, Lady Worplesdon." Jeeves herded her out the door.

Once she was gone, Holmes barked out a sharp laugh. "I'm compelled to wonder if Mr. Wooster wouldn't rather remain kidnapped," he said.

"She wasn't as bad as all that. You're just upset that she was not in the least bit intimidated by you," I said, returning Holmes's jibe.

"You and the women," Holmes grumbled.

The remaining hours of the afternoon and evening passed in rapid planning. Receiving invaluable input from Jeeves regarding the location of Lady Elizabeth's boudoir, Holmes set himself to memorising the layout of the building and determining the best point of entrance. Supper came and went, of which Holmes, predictably, did not partake. He did nap on the couch for a few hours, much to my relief. He had not slept at all the last two nights, and I did not care for the idea of him carrying out such a dangerous and delicate task while frayed from exhaustion. Although the hour was growing late, I remained in my dinner jacket. When Holmes woke shortly after midnight, he must have noticed my attire, but he did not say a word. Instead, he retreated to the lavatory and shaved off two days worth of stubble. By the time he finished his ablutions, it was a few minutes before one in the morning.

"Freshening up for your night on the town?" I teased him, darkly amused by Holmes's priorities when he was about to embark on burglary.

"I will appear less suspicious on the streets, going to and from the house, if I am clean-shaven and respectably dressed."

"Ah, I should have known there was a sensible reason for it," I replied.

He glanced at the clock. "It's time," he said. "Jeeves?" Jeeves nodded once and vanished into the kitchen, reappearing seconds later with packages of meat wrapped in butcher paper. These Holmes stuffed into his satchel, along with the bottle of morphine, his lock picks and other burglar's tools, one of my old stethoscopes, a length of rope, and a torch modified to give off a dark red light instead of the usual white.

"If I'm not back by dawn, assume the worst," he said.

I stood before him and crossed my arms over my chest. "Holmes. I'm going with you."

"Watson-"

I raised one hand to halt Holmes's words before he spoke them. "You are about to make a very logical argument illustrating why I should not accompany you."

"Naturally."

"I will then ignore everything you say, logic be damned, and insist on staying at your side."

Holmes raised one brow. "Given the historical evidence, it is very likely."

"In the interest of saving time, let us skip the intermediate steps and progress straight to the moment when I remain resolute and you, at last, relent."

Holmes chuckled. "Oh, my dear Watson, who am I to refuse you?" The mirth vanished from his face. "It will be dangerous."

"I expect nothing less when I'm with you," I retorted.

The satisfied smile that spread across Holmes's lips and the smugness in his narrowed eyes made me glad that I had stubbornly held my position. I would have stepped forward to take him in my arms, but Jeeves's light cough reminded me that we were not alone and neither Jeeves nor Holmes would appreciate the impropriety.

Holmes turned to Jeeves. "If we don't return, Roberson's arranged meeting place is at the docks, in the Falmouth Shipping Company vault, tomorrow night. Do what you can to negotiate Mr. Wooster's release."

"I will, sir, though I hope that it will not be necessary."

Holmes nodded once in acknowledgement before darting out of the flat. I followed close at his heels, trusting that Holmes knew what he was doing or else all our attempts to escape Roberson's persecution would come to naught and we would end our days in a prison cell. The maximum penalty for burglary was harsher than that for sodomy. It we were caught, Roberson would not need to bother making my papers public to see us imprisoned, although spite and the added bonus of turning us into social pariahs would undoubtedly drive him to do so anyway. I wondered if Holmes would have taken the risk had Mr. Wooster's life not been on the line.

Holmes and I took a cab as far as Hampstead Heath, and from there made our way on foot to the grand residence of the de Glanville family. The night was grey and damp, a chill drizzle turning the buildings on either side of the street into shapeless masses in the haze. I turned up my collar, pulled my bowler more firmly down upon my head, and hunched against the light rain. Once we were at the wall that girded the de Glanville house, Holmes snatched the hat off my head, relieving me of even that small guard against the wet. He doffed his homburg as well and tucked it, along with my bowler, behind a small bush.

"It wouldn't do to have them fall off in the middle of our burglary," he murmured. His grey hair grew slick and dark from the rain. With the dim light from a far away streetlamp erasing the lines and hollows of his face he looked just as he had thirty years ago. I couldn't help but to smile. If he noticed my amusement, he didn't question it. "I'll be the vanguard, opening locks and leading us to the lady's boudoir. You will be my lookout. If you see anything, any movement, any light, don't say a word, simply tap my shoulder twice, like this." He demonstrated with two firm taps. "And follow my lead. Understood?"

"Understood." I suppressed the urge to give a sharp, military salute. I wondered if there was some magic in the air that stripped away the years, for just as Holmes seemed to me to be young again, so too I felt like an excitable youth seduced by the promise of adventure.

I watched the street with sharp eyes, ready to warn Holmes should I see any passers-by, while he swiftly and efficiently dosed the packaged meat with the morphine I had supplied. Once this was accomplished, he rewrapped the cutlets and placed them back in the satchel. "There will undoubtedly be some barking," he said, "but it can't be helped. The drugs should silence them quickly enough, and with luck the noise will be dismissed as excitement over a stray cat or another such innocuous interloper." His eyes were darting here and there, taking in whatever part of the grounds there was to be seen over the wall. He took particular note of a nearby tree, going so far as to point a long, white finger at it. "I'll go over first and subdue the dogs; you follow when I give the signal."

"Do be careful, Holmes. It would be a shame if you were to end your life by pasteurellosis brought on by a dog bite."

Holmes chuckled. "That would be an ignominious sort of death, wouldn't it? Have no fear, Doctor. I plan to perish in a manner far more extraordinary than by a mere infection." With those less than reassuring parting words, he sprung into the air and clambered over the wall. I waited, straining my ears to catch any sound of growling or snuffling that would indicate that the hounds had found Holmes. I need not have bothered to exert my senses, for when the dogs came they came with a racket that must have been heard a block away. Amongst the barking and howling there was a rustle of leaves and snapping of twigs, and then Holmes was sitting safely in the branches of the nearby tree, visible over the wall.

The barking stopped as abruptly as it had begun, and I could only assume that the dogs had found and begun to devour the meat, as it would take some moments for the consumed drug to take affect. We waited patiently, Holmes in the tree and I by the kerb. A few minutes later, Holmes descended and then reappeared perched on the top of the wall, one hand reaching down to me. I grasped his wrist and quickly scaled the partition. The instant my feet were firmly on the ground once more, Holmes laid his gloved hand against my lips. His meaning was plain: no speaking from here until the mission's end. The ends of his fingers stroked against my moustache as he slowly drew his hand away and my lips tingled at the absence of his touch.

Holmes, however, was utterly unaffected and wholly professional. He motioned me to follow and crept across the lawn. Two enormous black mounds, the sleeping dogs, broke the monotony of the smooth, flat turf. Trees dotted the grounds here and there, and Holmes kept to the long shadows they cast. As we drew closer, I could see that it was a beautiful residence, two stories high, with elegant Corinthian columns by the main doors and large windows that glistened in the misty rain. He took us to one of these windows, which looked in on the dining room, and swung the satchel off his shoulder. I cast my eyes over the area, watching for any sign of trouble while Holmes retrieved his burglar kit.

Half the tools inside looked more fit for an electrician than a criminal, but I had no doubt that they served some purpose. First, he took out the torch with the red light and with it he made a careful examination of the whole perimeter of the window frame. Next, he retrieved the glass cutter and cut away a portion of the window right up against the sill. He slid both hands into the hole and felt along the inside wall, the glass gouging long lines into his leather gloves. Finding whatever it was he was looking for, he withdrew his hands and took up the electrician's tools��"a spool of thin copper wire, wire cutters and a pair of needle-nose pliers. He cut off a section of wire, and armed with this and the pliers, once against slipped his hands through the window.

I couldn't see what he was doing, but it was clearly taking every ounce of his concentration. His mouth was firmly set and every small motion careful and deliberate. After standing outside and exposed for what felt like an age but couldn't have been more than a few minutes, Holmes breathed out a small sound of satisfaction. He repacked his tools and opened the window with a proud flourish. No alarm sounded and I let myself sigh in relief.

I climbed in after Holmes. A sharp stinging awareness, the nervous crackle that one feels when one is in peril, ran through me. While we were out on the lawn, there was still a chance that we could run and escape if were we caught. Trapped in the house, our position was far more precarious. Even when faced with the prospect of capture and arrest, however, I could not keep the exhilarated smile from my face, for I had always found enjoyment in adventure, just as Holmes thrilled when faced with a challenge. Criminal, dishonourable, and in terrible danger, yet at this moment we were more alive than ever.

Holmes took my hand and led me along as we padded our way through the hallway and up the stairs to the first floor, his keen eyes picking out obstacles, even those lost to my sight in the shadows. At the next to last door at the end of the corridor he stopped and put his ear to the keyhole. He must have heard only the sounds of deep sleep, for a few seconds later he nodded once in satisfaction and drew me to the next door over. Holmes took a bit of oil from his bag and greased the hinges so it opened without a sound. We stepped inside and closed the door behind us so that a wandering servant or family member passing by would not notice anything amiss.

The modified torch came out from the satchel again. Holmes thrust it into my hands and I dutifully turned it on, casting an eerie, blood-red circle of light. The Rembrandt that Jeeves had mentioned was simple to pick out, even to my artistically untrained eyes. Holmes plucked it from the wall and, just as Jeeves had promised, behind it was Lady Elizabeth de Glanville's safe.

Holmes motioned me closer. I pressed up against his side and held the light still and close by the safe's lock. It was a basic steel box with a combination lock rather than a keyhole. Holmes took out the stethoscope and set to cracking the safe, cool and methodical as any practiced thief. He was fixed on his work and was likely hearing nothing but the click of the dial, so I kept my eyes and ears alert to any movement in the house. It seemed to take an interminable length of time. My nerves stretched every second into hours and rankled at the enforced stillness at a moment when every animal instinct was screaming for action. I envied Holmes his focus and control.

At last the safe opened. Holmes reached in and pulled out a massive, twisted rope of gold. I had time for only the briefest glance before Holmes tucked it and his stethoscope back in the bag. The deed was done. No mere trespassers, we had now taken by stealth what was not ours to take. We moved quickly to finish our work. Holmes closed the safe while I fetched the Rembrandt to re-hang on the wall. Once the room was put back to rights and we stood at the door to the hall, Holmes retrieved the torch and dropped it in the satchel as well. He listened at the door for signs of life in the corridor, and when he heard none he took my hand again and led us through the darkness.

We were almost to the stairs when my hindbrain noticed a flicker of light at the edge of my vision before my conscious self realised what it was. There was no time to warn Holmes. I acted on instinct, grabbing him around the waist and pulling him back against me behind an armoire. Holmes did not question or protest, but remained perfectly still in my grip, his only movement the expanding and contracting of his ribs with each breath.

The light grew closer, jumping and flashing across the floor��"a candle, then, guttering with each step the bearer took. I peered over Holmes's shoulder, scarcely daring to breathe and wondering what we would do if we were caught. Then the late-night pedestrian was upon us, shuffling by with sleepy steps. It was a boy of no more than ten, eyes half-closed and looking neither left nor right as he made his way down the hallway. He passed us without a glance and continued on his way. I did not hear Holmes's silent, relieved laugh, but I felt it in the shudder of his lanky frame.

As soon as the boy had taken himself and his candle into a room and out of sight, Holmes and I hastened down the stairs and to the dining room. We met with no more surprises inside the house and climbed out the window. Once outside, Holmes shifted his satchel more securely on his shoulder and whispered against my ear.

"Quickly now." He dashed off across the wet lawn and I followed as swiftly as I could, cursing the stiffness in my leg that the damp air exacerbated. I reached the wall many seconds after Holmes. He, making a stirrup with his hands, gave me a boost up. Crouching on the top of the wall, I reached down to assist him in turn. We leapt down to the pavement in unison.

Holmes was breathing heavily from the mad sprint across the lawn, but his mouth was open in a wide grin and he was laughing between pants. "Good Lord, when that child walked by I thought we were finished!"

I rifled through the bushes, trying to find where Holmes had stuffed our hats. "There were moments I was sure my heart would burst from anticipation. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing." In truth, however, I'd not felt younger in years. Perhaps it was the excitement, the adventure. Perhaps it was the sight of Holmes's outrageous merriment. Whatever the reason, I wished to hold it close before it slipped away.

"Too old? Nonsense, my dear Watson." Holmes was recovering quickly from the earlier exertion and spoke with barely a hitch. He stepped over and found the hats in a second, dropping his homburg on his head before placing my bowler on mine, straightening the brim with care. "You did admirably. Now, let us complete our getaway." He took my arm in his and we walked away from the scene of the crime.

We took no more than a few steps, however, when I stopped Holmes with a command. "Wait," I said. It was a night for risks and audacious exploits and the bold spirit of adventure was not gone from me yet. I took his face in my hands and pulled him into a deep kiss, there on the empty street, almost daring a passer-by to come and catch us.

I took him by surprise, which was such a rare thing that I enjoyed the kiss all the more for it. The curl of his laughter still lingered as the drizzle of rain rolled off his hat brim and slid down his face, dripping past his lips and chilling the heat of his mouth.

Even when the kiss broke, we stayed close, our cheeks touching. Holmes was once again breathless. He raised his hand and placed his fingers on my mouth for the second time that night. This time he did not draw away immediately, but allowed his touch to linger until I could taste the leather of his glove.

All too soon, however, he dropped his hand and the moment ended. He took a small step back, re-establishing a respectable distance between us. Holmes's hat was cocked back on his crown, dislodged from its proper place by my enthusiasm, so I straightened it for him.

He coughed and licked his lips, finding his equilibrium once more. I smiled with pride at ruffling him so. Alas, it was not to last. When next he spoke, it was as if nothing untoward or remarkable had happened.

"We should press on," he said. "We're going to have a devil of a time finding a cab at this time of night."

He was, of course, correct. We walked for nearly three-quarters of an hour and were soaked to the bone before we chanced upon a cab driving the Highgate streets in the wee hours of the morning. It was not far to Mr. Wooster's flat and before long we were standing at his threshold dripping rainwater in front of his door. I rapped on the wood, hoping that Jeeves had not fallen asleep.

I need not have worried, for when Jeeves answered the door, he was as pressed and clean and alert as if it were three in the afternoon instead of three in the morning. I felt twice as clammy and ragged in comparison. He had anticipated our needs marvellously, carrying a pair of soft towels draped over his arms. I accepted one with gratitude and wiped the rain off my face.

"You were successful, I gather?" Jeeves asked while he helped Holmes peel himself out of his wet coat and jacket.

"Quite so," Holmes replied. "I confess I was a bit concerned about the electric alarm as I'd never seen one of that design firsthand before, but as it happened it was simplicity itself to jump the circuit." He took up the satchel and wandered into the sitting room, ignoring the water dripping from the hem of his trousers. Jeeves eyebrow twitched when Holmes dropped his still wet self onto the settee.

While Holmes rummaged though the bag, I dried myself with the towel as best I could. I dearly wished to change into dry clothes, and began to take myself off to the guestroom to do just that when I was interrupted.

"Watson!" Holmes called out. "Come here."

Summoned, I came, though not without some resentment. "Holmes, can't it wait five minutes? I'd like to get into something a little less drenched. You could do with a change of clothes yourself."

He dismissed my concerns with a flick of his hand. "Time for that soon enough. Look." He raised our stolen loot, these Jewels of Tarpeia, for my admiration, like a little boy showing off a mouse he'd captured.

The jewels were indeed most impressive. The diadem was not, as I had imagined, a small circlet, but a broad headdress with a fall of golden chains. The collar was likewise massive, yet with a delicate aesthetic for all its size, filigreed in intricate patterns around each perfect, black stone.

"See the granulation? This sort of skill and artistry was lost for thousands of years. Only in the last few decades have jewellers been able to recreate this sort of detail."

Jeeves had hung our coats to dry and now joined us in the sitting room. "From the graceful design and the soldering technique I would speculate that it dates from the late sixth century B.C. It is a truly magnificent piece."

"A fit ransom for Mr. Wooster?" Holmes slyly cocked one eyebrow.

Jeeves did not rise to the bait. His face remained impassive and he spoke without inflection. "Indeed, sir. May I fetch you some tea to ward off the chill?"

Holmes shrugged indifferently, but I thought hot tea sounded splendid and told Jeeves so, thanking him for the offer. Jeeves glided off to the kitchen, leaving us to our own devices.

Holmes gently cradled the golden collar in his hands. He smoothed his thumb over one of the cabochons, staring into the gem as if enthralled by the dark and distorted reflection it cast back. In a wholly unexpected move, he lowered his head and draped the collar on his shoulders. The gold was bright against the black cloth of his waistcoat. There was something both outlandish and absurd about Holmes donning ill-gotten priceless antiques over his damp and old-fashioned set of evening clothes.

"It doesn't suit you at all," I said.

"Ah well," Holmes replied with an affected air of regret. He removed the collar and placed it next to the diadem. He was silent then, staring off into the distance, thinking about Mr. Wooster and tomorrow's exchange, perhaps, or else about the very professional crime he had committed this night. Or he might have been dwelling on the flight patterns of bees, for all I could tell from his vacant expression. So many times he had seemed to read my mind simply by using his wonderful skills of observation and deduction. I wished so often I possessed the same talent where he was concerned.

Although I am no detective, I am a moderately skilled doctor, and although I could not read Holmes's thoughts on his face, I could read the drawn and pale face and shadowed eyes. Holmes had been running himself ragged and was in sore need of food and rest even if he would not admit it nor was even likely aware of it.

I interrupted his reverie. "I'm going to have a word with Jeeves. Why don't you get some dry clothes?" He nodded vaguely in reply. It was enough to know that he heard me, whether he'd take the suggestion or not was another matter.

I found my way to the kitchen where Jeeves was just arranging the tea set on the tray. "I'm sorry to bother you, Jeeves, but Holmes has barely eaten these last two days. Can I trouble you to make up something simple? A bit of toast would be fine, so long as he gets something in him."

"Of course, sir. We have some pasties left from lunch, would that do?"

"That would be perfect."

Jeeves fetched an extra plate, placed two pasties on it and arranged it all on the tea tray. When we returned to the sitting room, however, Holmes was stretched out on the settee fast asleep. I sighed, ruing the sheer impossibility of inducing the man to eat.

"Shall I offer him the use of the guestroom, sir?" Jeeves asked. It was the room I'd slept in last night. My clothes were hung in the wardrobe. I understood what Jeeves was subtly asking, and it was an attractive thought, to have Holmes sleeping at my side again for the first time in nearly a week. When I looked at Holmes's peaceful form, however, I knew that I could not accept the offer.

"No. He has such a terrible time falling asleep sometimes that I don't dare wake him now. He needs the rest too much."

"Very well, sir."

"If you have some spare blankets, though, I think he could use them." Fond exasperation coloured my voice. "The reckless fool is still in his wet clothes and I don't want him to catch a chill."

"I shall fetch a duvet immediately."

When the blankets were brought out, I took them from Jeeves's arms and spread them out over Holmes's sleeping form. I tried not to think about tomorrow's headlines and the burglary they were sure to report. I also tried not to think about seeing Roberson again, although I knew we could hardly make the exchange otherwise, for he was sure to use the opportunity to taunt Holmes. As I brushed his damp and tangled hair away from his forehead, I tried not to think about his hand on my lips, there and then gone, like a swift break of light amidst dark clouds, swallowed up by the gloom as quickly as it had come.
