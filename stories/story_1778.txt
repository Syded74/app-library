<p><b><font size=+2>"I shall really miss you when you return home, Your
Highness" said the dragon as the pair sat outside his cave one morning
in April, the day&nbsp; before Princess Sara was due to begin her walk
back home - she was still not permitted to ride the horse, and so would
need to start soon if she were not to be late.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I'll miss you, Bill" replied the Princess, moving
away from him as he exhaled cigar smoke - at least he was smoking a decent
brand by this time!</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>&nbsp;"I see you have finally managed to capture a
damsel - well done!&nbsp; I'm so incredibly happy for you, old chap!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>They both turned towards the cave entrance, where one
of the village maidens was securely tied to an iron ring fixed in the rock.&nbsp;
She was wriggling desperately in a hopeless and doomed attempt to get free.&nbsp;
For reasons best known to herself she did not seem to share Princess Sara's
happiness at the dragon's final success in damsel capturing after so many
disappointments.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Mind you, Bill, old fellow, she's not half as good
looking as I am!&nbsp; It will only be a pretty third grade knight who
comes to her rescue.&nbsp; She could be in for very long wait indeed, poor
girl!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The dragon sighed sadly at this. "I suppose so - but
one has to start somewhere! A journey of a thousand miles begins with just
a single step.&nbsp; And she doesn't look too bad, especially if the lighting
is satisfactory and you view her from the right angle."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"With your eyes closed is the best way to look at her!"
replied the unkind Princess in a voice loud enough for the captive to hear.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Another disappointment is that she is not naked like
you."&nbsp; complained the dragon.&nbsp; "I shall miss looking at your
nice tits,&nbsp; tanned flat stomach,&nbsp; that rounded, gorgeous,&nbsp;
firm young rump, and the whole golden skinned loveliness of you, after
you leave tomorrow.&nbsp; I really will!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Sara blushed prettily and smiled even more prettily
at this compliment.&nbsp; She then stood up and went over to the captive
damsel.&nbsp; She looked back at the dragon.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"If you want her to be naked, then why not undress
her?&nbsp; It's getting warmer every day - she won't freeze!"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"I don't like to interfere with her to that extent"
said the dragon. "I feel rather embarrassed about handling her that intimately."</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Well - here's one last favour.&nbsp; Think of it as
a goodbye present!" said the Princess with a silvery laugh, which caused
the dragon to regret even more that this lovely neighbour was so shortly
to be gone.&nbsp; With these words she ripped off the poor girl's peasant
clothes, after which she bent down and removed her boots.&nbsp; Sara's
delicate, beautiful little nose wrinkled disgustedly as the odour from
the girl's unwashed feet reached her sensitive royal nostrils.&nbsp; She
walked back to her place next to the dragon and resumed her squatting position
at his side.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>"There you are, my scaly, cigar smoking neighbour!&nbsp;
One naked damsel!&nbsp; If you value my advice you will give her a good
hosing down.&nbsp; She's really high!&nbsp; Stinks to high Heaven.&nbsp;
I can't decide if I did the right thing or not.&nbsp; I mean to say, just
look at her!&nbsp; She's so horribly flabby!&nbsp; Not enough exercise
and too much junk food - disgusting!&nbsp; No knight in his right senses
would ever ride to the rescue of that!&nbsp; Best let her go in a couple
of days.&nbsp; The knight would only kill you, anyway - they always do,
you know!&nbsp; Hadn't been told that, had you?"</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The green dragon thanked her for this warning.&nbsp;
Half an hour later Sara rose to her feet, preparatory to leaving.&nbsp;
The pair embraced as they said goodbye for the last time.&nbsp; He promised
to untie the village wench later that day.&nbsp; It had been the catching
of her that had given him the greatest satisfaction, and he was beginning
to tire of her perpetual whining.&nbsp; Not only that, but he too had noticed
the peasant girl's distasteful and offensive&nbsp; unwashed smell.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>......................................................................................................................................................</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The few months that Princess Sara had spent on this
hillside had been peaceful and happy.&nbsp; Her beloved white horse had
been comfortably housed in the cave and provisioned daily as she went down
to the farm and back to collect fresh hay, a load of which she carried
on her back for him.&nbsp; During the day she would chat to her neighbour
Bill,&nbsp; the incompetent and undersized cigar puffing dragon, after
climbing the rocky slope up to his cave.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>She had slept outdoors every night and had long since
ceased to call on the magical white dogs to shield her from the rain, which
she had learnt to sleep through as easily as if&nbsp; the weather were
warm and dry.&nbsp; How she dreaded being confined to her bedchamber of
a night when she went home!&nbsp; She determined that she would have the
windows wide open, no matter what the weather!&nbsp; And fires would be
banned in her apartments!</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>As she made the journey from the dragon's cave to her
own for the last time, she asked herself once again what difference the
last months had made to her. Very little in some ways, she decided.&nbsp;
She still knew herself to be a Princess and had always been conscious of
her superior rank even during the very worst times.&nbsp; It was a great
joy, though, to have developed such a mystical rapport with all the birds
and animals around her, whose unhoused and free condition she had shared
these last amazing months,&nbsp; and would continue to share for a while
yet.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Whenever she had been given hospitality along the way
and this generosity had consisted in the provision of meals in which fowl
and flesh had played a large part, she had never been able to suppress
a feeling of guilt.&nbsp; Each lovely well-cooked dish might, after all,&nbsp;
contain the body of a former friend!&nbsp; Generally, though,&nbsp; she
managed&nbsp; to shrug off consideration of such moral dilemmas and enjoy
her meal!</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>The beautiful Princess&nbsp; was not a particularly
deep thinker, being&nbsp; first and foremost&nbsp; a woman of action, whose
quick intelligence was directed at the immediate world around her, as befitted
a future ruler, which she was irrevocably determined to be by this time.&nbsp;
"They aren't putting me through all this shit for nothing" was her abiding
thought.</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>Sadly, her use of foul language was increasing all
the while - she had given vent to some extremely highly coloured utterences
at the time of her flogging, albeit&nbsp; 'sotto voce' .&nbsp; Martha,
with her peasant blood,&nbsp; would have applauded, but not her father.&nbsp;
Still less the saintly Archbishop, whom she was, in any case,&nbsp; determined
to sack as soon as she became Queen!</font></b><b><font size=+2></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+2>For the last time she laid herself down at the entrance
to the cave, guarding her beloved white horse, safe inside, with her by
now formidable presence.&nbsp; She slept.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow the journey
home would begin!</font></b>
