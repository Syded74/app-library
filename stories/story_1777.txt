<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#330033">Within seconds of the fairy's final command, Sara
was naked in front of others for the first time since Nature had&nbsp;
granted her the body of a mature and lovely woman.&nbsp; She hated what
she was being asked to do, but recognised,&nbsp; in the Good Fairy, a person
who would brook no argument.&nbsp; Her future happiness was in the hands
of this implacable person.&nbsp; She knew at once what she must do and
had not the slightest hesitation in doing it.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">She must marry Prince Adelbert and that was that!&nbsp;
Whatever the next year and a day might hold, whatever hardships and humiliations&nbsp;
might be in store for her,&nbsp; would all be worth while and of no account,
once Adelbert's eyes gazed on her with the same desperate longing that
she felt for him.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">Martha removed her own clothes and the fairy glared
at her.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">"Get dressed at once!&nbsp; I know what you are
thinking.&nbsp; You want to share the Princess's hardships!&nbsp; Very
estimable, I'm sure,&nbsp; and she is lucky to have such a loyal friend,
as well as totally undeserving!&nbsp; She must face her ordeal alone.&nbsp;
No one from this Kingdom must accompany her.&nbsp; Disobey me and you will
be sorry."</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">The Fairy disappeared and Sara immediately walked
towards the Palace door, followed by the King and the Countess Martha,
both crying bitterly at the thought of this bright and lovely jewel being
lost to them for so long, perhaps for ever!&nbsp; Princess&nbsp; Sara,
on the other hand,&nbsp; had no tears in her eyes and no fear in her heart,
now that she knew what she must do.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">The amazed stares of the servants and courtiers
were of no consequence to her.&nbsp; This shy and very private girl who
had feared to show herself,&nbsp; even to her very dearest friend, was
now naked before the entire world.&nbsp; She suppressed her embarrassment
and controlled herself - so well that not the slightest hint of a blush
could be seen on her ivory white, lovely,&nbsp; grimly determined&nbsp;
face.&nbsp; Whatever was to befall her, she was a Princess and a very beautiful
one at that.&nbsp; This was something she was never to forget until the
day she returned to claim the love of her chosen man!</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">Like Martha before her, the touch of the rough
ground under her bare feet sent signals up and down her body.&nbsp; The
feel of the warm sun, allowed to caress her skin for the first time ever,&nbsp;
was another revelation.&nbsp; A light breeze blew and brushed against her
white and shapely slimness, as if the very air itself were taking the Princess
into its care and safe keeping.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">"Don't fear for me, Father darling, or you,&nbsp;
my sweet beloved companion!&nbsp; I 'll be back - you'll see!"</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">The King and the Countess accompanied her to the
entrance to the Palace gardens and embraced her tenderly.&nbsp; She returned
their embraces and shed a tear for the first time since receiving her sentence
from the Good Fairy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sorrowing pair looked at her departing
nudity as she strode confidently into the distance.&nbsp; They did not
turn away to return to the Palace until the Princess, who meant so much
to them both,&nbsp; was quite out of sight.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">Martha considered the Good Fairy's warning for
a while and decided that no power in this world or any other would come
between her and her duty to her lovely friend.&nbsp; Now that she had no
Princess to whom to be a companion, she had no place at Court.&nbsp; Her
time was now her own and she knew how she would use it.&nbsp; The Fairy
knew what was in her mind and cogitated with herself what terrible vengeance
she might take on the loyal girl.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">(I wonder if she really is THAT good a fairy -
author)</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">......................................................................................................................................</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">Once she knew that she could no longer be seen
by those nearest to her, the former Princess, now a naked vagrant girl,&nbsp;
slackened her pace, in deference to the soreness which her tender young
feet were already experiencing.&nbsp; Even if she tried to avoid rough
and stony places and trod only on grass, the effect of her barefootedness
was increasingly painful and it was&nbsp; only a massive application of
her haughty will power that prevented her from limping.&nbsp; She would
walk the world naked, alone and desperately poor for a year,&nbsp; and
she would walk proudly, no matter what the cost to her in pain.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">By the end of the day, the Princess was still
well within&nbsp; her father's Kingdom and several passing people had recognised
her.&nbsp; They doffed their hats in deference and seemed no wise surprised
to see her in such a naked and wretched state.&nbsp; She could swear that
the birds in the trees as she passed were saying.</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">"There walks the lovely Princess.&nbsp; She will
be worthy of the love of her chosen man.&nbsp; May she be protected from
harm."</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">As a matter of fact, that is precisely what they
were saying!</font><font color="#330033"></font>
<p><font color="#330033">The heat of the day wore off and dusk succeeded
the midday brightness, and still the naked wanderer pressed on.&nbsp; Night
fell and the aching tortured feet continued to stride in the direction
of the border and the world beyond her own country.&nbsp; For three days
she ceased not to walk until she knew that the Fairy's instructions had
been fully obeyed and that she was finally in a foreign land, away from
all friends and from all who would help her.&nbsp; Once on foreign soil,&nbsp;
she sank to the ground and slept.&nbsp; Now that her adventure was truly
begun, she felt only peace in her heart.&nbsp; She dreamt a happy dream
for a change, a dream in which Prince Adelbert figured very prominently
and was doing all manner of really nice things to her!</font>
