Lisa Again - and Again - Finis</font><br
 style="font-family: courier new;">
<br style="font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"LISA!
Your face! What a mess. I never saw you that bad. I won't ask who
won! Never mind! You couldn't have been expected to give your
best, not with all you have on your mind right now. You'd better go to
bed and stay there a week! I'll get the doctor to see to you. Get
upstairs at once and prepare to be an invalid!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Stop
fussing, Samantha! I'm fine! In fact I'm on top of the world! And,
despite what that other cow did to me, I still have my one hundred
percent record and you should have seen what I did to HER! She'll need
reconstructive surgery! As for going to bed at this early hour -
forget it!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Lisa
did disappear upstairs and shed her minute shorts and top. Soon she
reappeared in her usual state of undress. Samantha had a chance to see
all of the damage, to her body as well as her face! That wonderful
athletic body was covered in bruises where the hard leather had crashed
into her ribs and pounded her belly.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Is
there anywhere I can touch you without it hurting?" asked
Samantha in horror. She had seen Lisa get hurt many times before
but this was something else! She was torn between sympathy and a regret
that she had missed what must have been a magnificent duel!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Not
one solitary square millimetre was left unpunished, my dear! But come
and be hugged anyway!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Samantha
obeyed, trying to embrace Lisa gently but finding herself crushed in
the familiar bearhug.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"And
where is my brother today?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"He's
off to Birmingham, Lisa. He's singing in Beethoven's Missa Solemnis.
You'd never have believed how excited he was when he got the
offer. They're a very good choir and usually get really well-known
soloists. I bet you're proud of him, Lisa! I'd have gone, but I didn't
want you coming back to an empty house - not if you'd been badly
knocked about - which you obviously were, you brave girl! Are you
sure you don't want a rest? We could get into bed together and chat!
Come on!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Truth
to tell, Lisa was dog-tired after all that had happened. She was about
to follow Samantha upstairs when she had an idea.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Sammy!
Lets pile a few cushions on the lawn and sleep out in the warm! It's
such a lovely day and who wants to be inside with the sun just begging
us to soak it up?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">As
soon as Sammy had prepared a makeshift bed outside, the pair settled
down. Lisa told Sammy about her chance meeting with Rosanne. She was
resting her head on her friend's breast and getting more and more
sleepy. Samantha was not sleepy, though, and her mind was racing.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"That
was no chance meeting, Lisa! People don't just bump into each other by
accident in a big place like London. You could both have been there for
weeks wandering about and never seeing each other. She was
looking for you! It sticks out a mile. She probably traced you to your
hotel and they told her you were running in Hyde Park. I wonder why she
came all this way just to see you again. Probably got continuing
designs on your bum! She wants to whack it again, Lisa! Do you feel it
tingling?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Yes.
Of course she was looking for me! She left her job soon after you left
the country to come here. Now she claims to have got hold of evidence
clearing me. Not only that but she says she has the wherewithal for
creating a scandal of Watergate proportions - bigger, even!" </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Then
Lisa fell asleep, resting her head on Samantha's generous bosom. In
time Samantha herself fell asleep. Then, as the sun was beginning to
lose its strength, she was jolted out of her slumber by a man's voice.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Something
to sign for, Miss! Sorry to break up the party!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">It
was a courier company and Samantha, who was not wearing any more than
Lisa, got up and signed for the package. She tried to ignore the eyes
boring into her. Lisa was not too far away and she would soon deal with
any predatory male who got the wrong ideas! The courier got back into
his van and his colleague drove off. He soon became alarmed.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Keep
your eye on the road, Jimmy! We don't want an accident! What a
pair of lovelies! And all laid out to view, bare-arse naked like the
day they were born. And one of them was standing just inches from me as
she signed for the package. She actually touched me! But did you see
her mate - the one who was asleep? She'd really been worked over! Maybe
they'd had a lovers quarrel or something! "</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"I
don't know who did that to the Sleeping Beauty, but she's too big a
girl for it to have been the other one. That was a body you don't often
see on a girl, let alone a pretty one! All muscle! I wonder what the
story is behind those two?"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">*************************************************************</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">The
package Sammy had signed for was the promised evidence from Rosanne. It
took the two a while to fathom it all out. Lisa could read none of the
language and Sammy only a little, but the letters from and to the US
Embassy proved beyond doubt that poor Lisa had been no more than a
scapegoat. One letter from the UK Ambassador showed that he knew of
Lisa's innocence and had agreed not to make a fuss in exchange for some
trade concessions (which never materialised).</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">And
the most damning evidence of all was Gloria's confession! This cause of
Lisa's many miseries had not died in Solitary. She had indeed passed
out a few days before her time was up and been thought to have died.
But when the camp doctor and Rosanne had taken her from the cell, they
had discovered that she was still - just about - alive.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Rosanne
later told Lisa how she had kept Gloria in a deactivated cell in the
Solitary Unit until she was well enough to be moved. The doctor had
agreed to provide a fake certificate of death and all three had left
the country for Singapore, where the doctor and Gloria still were. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">In
the coming weeks the whole world was to learn the story behind Lisa and
Samantha. Despite Rosanne's refusal to take a penny, Lisa determined
that she would do something for this ex-guard who had helped her clear
her name and rescued Giles from ruin and worse. The scandal was just
about dying down, with a Minister of Justice in jail, the US Ambassador
blowing his brains out and the UK government driven from office by
universal rage that a sweet girl like Lisa should have suffered so
horribly because of their complicity in a squalid cover up at the
behest of a so-called ally. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Photographs
of a happy carefree Lisa taken shortly before her arrest were shown
side by side with Giles's portrait of the shaven headed victim in
prison, and the rage was universal. With elections just months away
only a miracle would save the government from defeat. Lisa grew her
hair for the benefit of the press, then shaved it off again as soon as
the case against Giles had been thrown out.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">At
the same time as Giles's trial, her first novel had been published and
was a best -seller. The other six were in the pipeline and the size of
the advance she had received had almost given her a heart attack!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">With
heads rolling and governments falling Lisa was glad to get back to her
rural retreat, now hers alone as the newly wed Samantha and
George honeymooned in the Bahamas. Giles was away for three weeks
and Lisa knew what she had to do! She got on the phone to
Rosanne. Soon she was picking Hatchet-Face up from the station
and driving her to the cottage. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">She
showed Rosanne her room and then told her what her reward was to be for
helping her.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"I
am alone here for three weeks, Rosanne. In that time I am at your
disposal. You can do what you like to me. When I finish speaking, you
are in charge again! All I ask is that you leave no permanent marks on
me as you whip, cane and otherwise torture me! I have all you should
need in the way of canes and straps and restraints. My body is yours to
fill with agony, punishing it by day and by night for three wonderful
weeks!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Right,
Lisa. I think we'll start with forty cuts on those ever luscious
buttocks. Those sweet but naughty cheeks cry out for chastisement
and they are going to get it! You will find my eye has lost none of its
cunning or my arm its strength! Then get this place cleaned up! It's a
disgrace! You sleep outside at night and be ready at six tomorrow
morning to be flogged!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"Yes.
Ma'am!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">The
cane turned out to be less robust than the one Rosanne had used on her
bottom in prison and broke at the twentieth stroke. The remaining
twenty were done with a whip. Rosanne added twelve more to punish Lisa
for using substandard materials!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">It
took Lisa until well after dark before Rosanne was satisfied with her
cleaning. She gave her twenty more lashes and sent her outside
to sleep on the lawn, naked and cold as the temperatures dropped. At
six, Lisa was standing to receive her morning flogging. Rosanne had to
secure
her first and it all took longer to prepare than at the prison, where
several other guards had been around to assist Rosanne, but it
was not long before leather cut into flesh and the sound cracked
briskly out in the morning air.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">As
soon as she had finished, Lisa was allowed to dress in bra and briefs and go for her
morning training run. When she returned, she was roughly stripped and tied up by the feet
and hoisted over a tree branch. Rosanne said to her. "I think you can
hang around here for the day!"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">At
noon the thirsty Lisa saw Rosanne come out of the house with a glass of
water in her hand. Any thought that refreshment might be due for the
upside down and dangling Lisa soon vanished as her captor drank the
glass dry herself. Lisa was left alone until evening when Rosanne came
back with a riding crop.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">"LIsa
needs putting to sleep for the night!" said Rosanne.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">She
then started going up and down Lisa whipping every part of her body
with the crop. Soon she was burning all over with the stinging impact
as the leather thong came down remorselessly onto her skin. And it was
not only her flesh that was on fire! Her head was spinning as she
responded to the pain. Her groin ached with a craving desire for more
of this punishment and she felt her juices running down her stomach as
her vagina pulsed and throbbed with the sheer power of the most
incredible orgasm she was ever to experience again in her life.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Rosanne
left her hanging for the night and Lisa's dreams were full of one lurid
image after another. It was a cold night, but when she woke in the
morning, she was drenched with sweat. Then Rosanne came out and whipped
her again, and again and again until her body was raw. After that she
left her all day, after giving her something to drink, for she was
thirsty to the point of delirium after nearly two days.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
Lisa had been a week hanging upside down and beaten several times
daily, before Rosanne released her and told her she had satisfied her twisted
appetite for ever as far she, Lisa, was concerned. Because she was so
weak after her ordeal Lisa needed to be assisted back into her home and
Rosanne put her to bed, caring for her until she recovered. They slept
together every night and both declared to the other that they had
enjoyed the love as much as they had revelled in the torture.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Just
before her guest left, Lisa examined herself carefully. Despite the
mind blowing amount of quite extraordinary pain she had inflicted on
her body, Rosanne
had, in accordance with Lisa's instruction, left no lasting mark and
her skin was as flawless as ever. Flawless that is, except for the many
scars from her fights, a collection which was nowhere near
complete as yet and which she would bear proudly for the rest of her
life.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">Although
the rest of Rosanne's visit was left to Lisa's showing her the sights
and the surrounding country, there was one last treat she had to
offer her guest and benefactor. On Rosanne's last morning at the
cottage, Lisa bent over,
presenting her buttocks for one last blistering attack before the whip
was laid down for the last time. Not long after this, Rosanne left to
return to her own country, now freed of its old regime, but still with
a prison system whose cruelties no Western tourist in their right mind
would dream of sampling. Rosanne would watch over many naked young
inmates in solitary in the years ahead but none would ever inspire her
as Lisa
had and none would be there for so long.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<br
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: courier new;">A
month after Rosanne left, Lisa and Giles were married at St George's
Hanover Square. She continued her career as an undefeated female
fighter until
shortly after her twenty-fifth birthday, when she fought a ferocious,
merciless eighteen
year old Amazon who gradually and remorselessly wore her down for ten
rounds and, over the folowing seven, pulped her before knocking her out
for her first and
only time. Samantha was there to witness this and wept, knowing she
would never see Lisa fight again.<br>
<br>
Not long after this setback she became pregnant and was happy to
abandon her brutal pastime, letting her hair grow full-length and
becoming, to
everyone's relief, a model wife and mother to four girls, not one of
whom was to be spoiled as Lisa had once been. Giles and Lisa's father
might have wished to indulge these four beauties but Lisa had a way of
crushing both with one icy look!</span><br

END</span><br
