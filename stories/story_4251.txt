"Do you have a condom?"

"No."

"Oh... My mom says I have to always make sure the guy has a condom on."

"Yeah, but you don't want to use a condom your first time."

"Why not?"

"Trust me, you want it 'au naturel' your first time. It feels so much better."

"Yeah? It does?"

"Definitely."

"But what if I get pregnant?"

"You won't get pregnant. You're too young."

"No I'm not. I'm thirteen, and I'm pretty much regular now. I mean, my period is."

"It'll be fine. I promise I'll get some for the next time."

"Maybe we should just wait."

"I can't wait. I need you so badly!"

"You're so horny!"

"It's all you're fault, you're such a goddess."

"A goddess?"

"A sex goddess. A thirteen year old sex goddess!"

"You're so full of shit! I think we should wait."

"I can't wait! I'm a man, you know. A grown-up man. I have needs."

"Needs?"

"And you have to help me. That's what girls do."

"I have to?"

"Well, you don't <i>have</i> to. But you should."

"I know. And I want to. But still, we should wait."

"Damn, girl!"

"My mama taught me well, huh?"

"She sure did. She'd be proud. You want to see something cool?"

"OK, what?"

"That table by the bed? Open the drawer."

"You liar! You do have condoms!"

"Yeah!"

"Wow, you have a ton of them! We can have sex all day!"

"Good idea! Let's get started!"

"Um..."

"You can't say no now, you got your damn condoms!"

"I'm not gonna say no, OK? Jesus."

"Good. Let's get your clothes off now, babe."

"You're so horny!"

"It's your fault remember."

"It's not my fault that all that thing between your legs thinks about is sex."

"Check it out! He's definitely thinking about sex now!"

"God, he's huge!"

"He's ready to show his girl how much he loves her!"

"Hey, wait, you need to put a condom on first."

"Oh come on, babe. At least let me go in bare, OK? I'll put one on later, I promise. Let me pop your cherry bare, OK?"

"You really want to?"

"Yeah!"

"I guess a couple seconds won't hurt anything, right?"

"Nah. Your mama wouldn't mind at all!"

"Yes she would!"

"Well, mama's not always right, huh?"

"She's right about this one though."

"Oh, come on, babe! Just for a little while!"

"OK, but you have to promise to put one on once you pop my cherry, OK?"

"I promise!"

"OK."



"Ahhh!"

"Oh, yeah!"

"It hurts!"

"Shhhh..."

"Ooooohhhh!"

"Oh, baby, yeah!!! You're so fucking wet! You're so fucking hot!"

"Oh, it hurts! It's too big!"

"Oh baby! Oh baby!"

"Don't! It hurts too much!"

"Oh baby! Oh baby! There you go!"

"Oh my god!!!"

"Oh you're so fucking tight Cali, Oh fuck!"

"Wait, you said..."--grunt--"you'd put a condom on."

"Oh my god, Cali, you're such a fantastic little fuck!"

"You said you'd... put a condom... on!"

"I will, just a little while."

"You said... you'd do it after... you popped my cherry."

"I know. Shhh!"

"But..."

"Shhh, it's OK, baby. Just a little while longer, it feels so good!"

"OK... Just a little while... longer."

"Oh baby, I love you."

"I love you too."

"Oh baby, oh baby!"

"I think you should... put a condom on... now."

"Oh baby! I can't stop now! Oh Cali! Oh fuuucckkk!"



"You said you'd put a condom on! You promised!"

"I know, baby, I'm sorry."

"What if I get pregnant?"

"You won't."

"You're a bastard."

"I'm sorry, baby, it just felt so good, I couldn't help it."

"I'm never going to let you have sex with me again."

"But Cali, I love you! I said I was sorry!"

"Well, maybe I'll change my mind. I don't know. I'm really pissed right now."

"Come on, baby. I'm sorry."

"Well, you have to promise to put a condom on next time."

"I promise!"
