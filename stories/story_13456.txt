Remus can tell when the Dark Mark flares to life. There's a pinched look to Severus' eyes and mouth. He moves as if his robes are constricting or his boots have rubbed blisters onto his feet. He hates to be touched; even the most casual contact will make him recoil as though he's been singed. It's how Remus feels just before moonrise.

The Healers suggest salves, potions to treat burns, ice packs, cool baths, yet Severus continues to smolder. Sometimes Remus thinks he takes comfort from the ache itself, like a form of penance. But sometimes it hurts to watch.

"Hands aren't enough." Severus' voice is almost apologetic as he puts the curved handle of the stiff paddle into Remus' palm. There's a wrist strap almost as long as the circle of leather. It resembles a hairbrush that has lost its bristles.

Remus smacks his own palm, feels numbness follow the bite. "I can't," he tries to say, but Snape has dropped to his elbows and knees, waiting. Sirius, too, had begged to be hit, craving pain after Azkaban like he still needed to block out Dementors. Severus wants only the heat -- his flushed skin distracted from the deeper wound.

~~~~

Having Remus ejaculate on him is so important to Severus that Remus thinks he must enjoy Muggle pornography, obsessed with brazen spurting pricks rather than the intimate telltale looks and sounds of coming inside someone. Only gradually does Remus realize that it isn't the visuals, but the hot fluid pumping onto his body that Severus wants; not to withhold the tightness of his arse nor his eager, sucking mouth from his lover at the moment of climax, but to feel that heat oozing into his armpit, between his feet, against his cheekbone, places that have never been so warm before.

~~~~

The candle is heated enough to leave welts -- though not, Remus hopes, enough to make the red spots burst. He knows healing spells, but he is still afraid of ripping away skin with the tiny hairs caught in the cooling wax.

"More," Severus grunts, the first noise he has made since the liquid spilled onto him, forcing from him a sharp hiss of breath...so loud that for a moment Remus thought the sound was flesh sizzling. He has no experience with this; perhaps Snape will laugh at his artlessness later. For now he lifts his unmarked arm, repeating, "More."

~~~~

He has asked to be bound to the grate at the wrists and at the elbows, so tightly that the circulation in his forearms has slowed, leaving the skin ashen past the indentations on his upper arms. As Remus shoves into Severus, making him move too, the cloth loosens, chafing bright blazing circles in his skin. It makes Remus think of rubbing sticks together to make a fire. He wonders how hard he would have to fuck Severus for the twisted cloth to burst into flame, and whether there would be a moment of painless oblivion as the Mark shriveled.

~~~~

It isn't that Severus is submissive, nor that he prefers it on the bottom. He fucks Remus vigorously when Remus needs to feel the ardor of possession...which he always does after anything that terrifies him.

The charring of the Mark, for instance. Remus had understood why Severus wished to do it, and that he wanted Remus in the room in case his injuries were greater than anticipated, or Voldemort somehow responded. Yet the moment flame touched skin and Remus smelled burning flesh, he dropped the lamp and rushed out to be sick, leaving Severus alone to put out the fire.

~~~~

It isn't that Severus is submissive, yet something in him said "yes" to the Dark Lord. Some part wanted to accept the Mark, to turn away from right and wrong. Whether that damaged him as a young man or whether prior damage made it possible, Severus is malleable to Remus now. In his agitation, to be flogged is heated distraction, to be pissed on is melting bliss; if Remus feels exultation rather than empathy, if he wishes to humiliate instead of comfort, Severus will accept it just the same.

Remus wonders if he has turned away from right and wrong.

~~~~

"I don't know if I can keep doing this. I hate myself with you like this."

"I see." Severus wears the same haggard expression when the Mark throbs. "I'd imagined that a werewolf might understand."

The Death-Eater has come with the potion to ease the werewolf's suffering. Remus can feel the heat of his body through his robes -- the armor Severus wears to hide his scars, from escape attempts as elaborate as Sirius' from Azkaban or Remus' from his own skin.

"It's because I understand." His cheeks burn with shame, and tears scald his eyelids when he looks at Severus.

~~~~

Mind-reader, he remembers too late. Legilimens. The other wizard has already witnessed the truth, and there is no hiding from that gaze. Severus can see the wolf, the dark creature, the thing Remus keeps hidden from everyone but especially from Severus, the part of himself that says "yes" to everything he isn't supposed to want. Right now especially including Severus.

Rather than looking horrified, however, Severus looks flushed. Aroused. His arm -- with the Mark -- hangs forgotten at his side.

Yes. Show me that.

Neither of them will know later who moves first, like a simmering cauldron that suddenly boils over.

~~~~

Words of passion make Snape blush and squirm. Sometimes he cries out, "Enough," as though an intimate part has been overstimulated...particularly if he's the one doing the talking.

After Sirius went to Azkaban, Remus lay shivering on the floor, unable to bear sleeping in his bed. It was the same after the Veil. He hasn't forgotten tearing his skin, a maddened wolf. But he knows that although love can be more painful than a mark burned into flesh, it also heals.

The faded, discolored skin of Severus' forearm is warm beneath the vise of his fingers. His cock is warmer.
