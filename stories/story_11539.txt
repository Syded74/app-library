From the pen of Dr. John H. Watson: In which Holmes and Watson are on the trail of our villain.

Chapter 2: Out of Retirement

Twelve hours earlier...

The late night train ride from Sussex to London was conducted in near silence, the only sound the steady click-click-click of the carriage on the rails. At home, Holmes had his fill of castigating me in every way possible, calling me ten kinds of fool. There was apparently nothing now he wished to say to me, and when I spoke to him, he gave not a hint of response, but merely stared out the window into the darkness and watched the lights of distant towns flicker on the horizon.

Sherlock Holmes was often a man of subtle emotions, so subtle that in our early acquaintance I suspected that he had no true emotions at all, only facsimiles put upon for the benefit of the world. After four decades, however, I had become quite adept at reading his moods. This was not the first time I had seen Holmes's fury, chilly as a midwinter's killing frost, but not since the day I had told him of my engagement to Mary had his cold and biting wrath been directed at me.

He was not wrong to blame me for our current trouble. I am man enough to admit my mistakes, and I confess that it was foolish to commit into writing anything detailing my private life with Holmes. My motives were pure, but Holmes cared little for motives unless they led to the solving of a case. He certainly did not care to hear me explain mine. I was not wholly incautious; I was not so blind that I did not realize how compromising my writings would be were they made public. I had them locked away, safe, or so I thought, in the vaults of Cox and Co. How the deuce the villain even discovered their existence I was sure I would never know.

The silence had stretched on for too long. "If you're not going to say a word to me, Holmes, I'm not sure why you insisted I come with you."

He did not look at me, but he spoke for the first time since we had entered the compartment together. His voice was distant and without inflection. "This disaster might require two people to avert it. There was no one else whom I could call on such short notice."

His words should not have hurt as much as they did. I was well aware of Holmes's inclination to callous practicality. "So I was convenient. How flattering. I do hope that's not the basis for all facets of our relationship."

Holmes flicked a quick glance my way before turning back to the window. "Insecurity doesn't become you," he muttered against the glass. Louder, he said, "Furthermore, you are the cause of this mess. It is only right that you put some effort into working towards a solution."

"So you're giving me an opportunity to atone," I said, eagerly. "In that case, I readily accept the task. I know that what I did was imprudent, and I'm sorry. I'll do whatever it takes to earn your forgiveness."

"This isn't atonement, and you don't need to earn my forgiveness. I am very angry with you, Watson. I will continue to be very angry with you until I am not. Your apologies, no matter how earnest and profuse, will not expedite this process." Holmes paused then. I wished I could see his face better, attempt to read his expression, but the lamp was dim and his eyes were sunk in shadow. "You cannot undo your mistake, no matter how much you may wish to."

"Holmes-"

With a wave of his thin hand he brushed aside my appeal and I lapsed into silence. Holmes was right. What was done could not be undone, and Holmes would either forgive me for it or he would not. Either way I could do nothing but leave him to his thoughts, give him my support as I always have done, and wait.

We reached London in the small, dark hours of the morning and took a room near the station. It was small and draughty with only a few rickety sticks of furniture, but it was conveniently located and neither of us cared to waste our time looking for something more suitable. I fell into the bed, so exhausted that I scarce noticed the scratchy texture of the sheets, and left Holmes sitting Indian-style on a hard chair smoking cigarette after cigarette. When I woke at dawn, after only a few hours of restless slumber, he was in exactly the same space and posture, and I knew that he had not slept at all. All the years of semi-retirement had not changed him one bit. Whenever a rare case came up, he immediately, and much to my dismay, fell back into his old habits, neglecting food and rest until the case was solved. As each year passed, his bouts of self-imposed deprivation affected his health more and more severely.

"Holmes, you shouldn't do this to yourself. At your age-"

"At my age, Watson? Not long ago you remarked that I was in the best of health."

"Yes, miraculously so, given the abusive way you treat your body. That doesn't mean that overwork and lack of sleep could not drive you into a sudden stroke. You're not immortal."

"I shall rest when this case is finished, which will be soon, whether I'm successful or not." He plucked an envelope from the desktop and displayed it to me with a little flourish. "Roberson says that he's going to send the documents to the press on Saturday. Today. So by this evening, either the documents will be retrieved and we can go home peacefully, or the documents will not be retrieved and we can go home and await public condemnation and probable arrest. Either way it will be over. Now, to work." He handed me the envelope, with its malicious little note inside it. "Tell me what you make of it."

"Holmes, this is no time to-"

"On the contrary, it is essential. Read it first."

"I've read it once; I have no desire to have that villain's words inflicted on me a second time."

"His words are important. Read it. Out loud."

The words, like a hundred sharp little tacks, lodged in my throat before I could even begin. I coughed once and read:

My Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

It has been many years since we last encountered one another. I do hope you have not forgotten me, for I assure you that I have not forgotten you. You will be interested to know that I am once more free to move about in the world, and plan to make good use of my new-found liberty.

I have in my possession certain notes of a biographical nature written by your dear companion. I suspect that they were written without your knowledge or consent and that you are ignorant of their content, for I cannot imagine that you would have permitted their continued existence had you been aware of them. I assure you that they are most shocking. The public, the press, and especially the police will be outraged to learn what sordid things you have kept hidden from them. We will see for ourselves on Saturday, when I bring the information to the attention of a certain London newspaper.

I will destroy you, Mr. Holmes. I will destroy your reputation, your honour, and your life.

You are, perhaps, now wondering why I have given you this warning, why I choose to show my hand so soon. The answer, sir, is quite simple. The dread that foreknowledge of your destruction will give you will be a sweet aperitif to the torment yet to come. I imagine you in your room, your dear doctor at your side, driven into a frenzy of alarm at the receipt of this letter. I confess the image pleases me greatly.

Most sincerely,

Marcus Roberson

I paused to collect myself. I could not read the note without feeling a sick rolling in the pit of my stomach, a mixture of disgust and dread. Holmes, however, impatiently urged me on.

"Continue," he said.

"Well," I attempted to put the contents of the note out of my mind and simply examine its form. I held it up to the light and peered at it, both to give it the sort of close inspection Holmes was demanding and to stall for time while I endeavoured to, as Holmes would say, observe what I saw. "The envelope is postmarked from Westminster. Other than that I can see nothing remarkable about it. The note itself is written on good quality paper, heavy but fine grained. There's some sort of watermark, but it's difficult to make out in this light. Italian manufacture?"

"Belgian, Watson, Belgian. The watermark is Dumont et Cie��"the language is clearly French. The company is an expensive manufacturer of paper located in Brussels."

I dropped the paper on the scarred writing desk. "I don't know why I bother doing this. You've already come to your own conclusions and appear to wish simply to mock my attempts."

"Don't be foolish, Watson-"

"You're not doing much to disprove my point."

"When you work your way through all the steps, slowly, it allows me to do the same, and catch any errors or details I may have overlooked."

"And what, pray tell, do you think are the chances that you overlooked something?"

"Small, I grant you. Still the possibility exists, and I like to take precautions." Holmes lit another cigarette and exhaled a thin swirl of smoke before he continued. "You are correct as far as it goes, although you observed nothing beyond the obvious. Yes, the paper is high quality. Yes, it has a watermark. But what does that tell you? What can you deduce?"

My temper broke. "I can deduce nothing," I growled. "Nothing beyond the obvious fact that this man wants to destroy us, and yet aside from your constant recriminations of me for my carelessness, you don't seem terribly distressed by it. I'm beginning to think that the breach of privacy bothers you more than the potential gaol sentence."

Holmes raised one eyebrow, looking at me as if I were an inmate escaped from Bedlam. He blinked once and held out his hand for the note, which I passed to him with a resigned sigh. Holmes spoke as if my outburst had not happened. "He can't have been in London long enough to establish himself in permanent rooms, so he is probably at a hotel. He has lost none of his taste for the finer things in life; the paper and the fine quality of the ink tell us that. The pen used is likewise extravagant. It has a broad, 18 karat gold nib, probably a Simplo, the Meisterstück model. You can see clearly the fine flexibility in the strokes of each letter. Most telling, however, is the clue you have failed to notice, namely, the scent of wall paint that lingers on the paper. That narrows the field down considerably. We must look for a well-to-do hotel in Westminster that is currently being or recently has been repainted."

"He must know that you could track the stationary," I pointed out. "What if this newly painted hotel isn't in Westminster? He could have taken a cab from his hotel and posted it from a different borough just to throw you off the trail. We can't go traipsing about smelling the lobbies of every first-rate hotel in London. We'd never find the right one in time."

"Ah, but you forget to take into account Roberson himself, the sort of man he is. Arrogant. Vindictive. He wants me to track him. He wants a confrontation. After all, he sent the note, knowing that I would come."

The thought disturbed me. I indeed knew what sort of man Roberson was: violent, sadistic, ruthless, and cruel. Holmes's first encounter with the villain left him with a deep scar where Roberson had stabbed him in the side; I feared what damage he might inflict this time. "You will be careful, Holmes, won't you? If you think Roberson is leading you into a trap��""

Holmes scoffed in irritation. "You needn't carry on so. I'm quite capable of outwitting Roberson."

I said nothing in reply, for in the mood he was in, Holmes would likely take any rebuttal as an excuse for an argument, but I swore to myself that I would keep my service revolver with me at all times until this deadly business was complete.

We began our search at the Savoy Hotel. The concierge looked on in distress as Holmes darted here and there about the lobby, inspecting the corners and fluttering light touches over the walls and finally accosting a maid and interrogating her. When a bellhop was summoned ��"a large, broad shouldered young man��"I thought it best to intervene before Holmes was bodily removed from the premises.

"I beg your pardon, sir," I said, handing the concierge my card and interrupting him before he could give the order to have Holmes evicted. "My name is Dr. John Watson and my eccentric friend is Mr. Sherlock Holmes. We're terribly sorry to intrude like this, but we're investigating a case and believe that we may find a lead in your hotel."

"Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson?" The concierge's face rumpled in an expression that was part perplexity, part disbelief, and part awe. It was as if I had told him that Ottoman Emperor and his vizier had dropped by for tea and a spot of rugby.

"Yes. We won't be long, and we'll try not to make too much of a disturbance."

The concierge did not appear entirely convinced, but he was diverted enough to do no more than stand and watch in bewilderment while Holmes flitted about the room. Soon, Holmes was done with his inspection. He shook his head in negative and drew me back out onto the street and to our cab, which had dutifully waited for us by the kerb.

In such a manner we worked our way through the hotels of Westminster. Holmes's pace was frenetic, and at each stop the wild speed with which he whirled through his examinations reminded me that time was of the essence. Each minute that passed increased the chance that Roberson had already left to post his treacherous packet. The looks our hired cabbie gave us became more and more curious each time Holmes ordered him to a new address with all speed.

After the fifth such stop, he queried as Holmes was stepping in the cab, "Look here, Messrs., I know I'm not paid to ask questions, but if it's good lodgings you're looking for surely it's a sight easier to just ask for one than to run about looking at each and every one of them."

"We're looking for a hotel with fresh paint," Holmes snapped.

"Particular about your place, aren't you?" If the cabbie noticed Holmes's sharp tone he was too mild natured to take it personally. "Well, if it's fresh paint you're after, then you'll want Claridge's. In Mayfair. It's got paint so fresh it's hardly dry."

With a keen look in his eye, Holmes leaned towards the cabbie. "Claridge's? You're sure."

"Sure as I am of anything. My wife Annie's a maid there. Been complaining to me about the fumes all week."

"How far away is it?"

"Just a few miles."

"Take us there as fast as you can." Holmes leapt into the cab. "There'll be a sovereign in it for you if you can get us there in less than ten minutes."

The driver stepped on the gas and sped down the street almost before Holmes had closed the door. I clenched my teeth and prayed that we wouldn't crash. Once or twice I had to grip Holmes's arm to keep from toppling into him as we turned a corner at breakneck speed. Holmes, much to my disgust, looked almost as if he were enjoying himself. His eyes were bright and his cheeks flushed with the excitement of the chase. We arrived at our destination in no time at all. Never was I so grateful to leave a cab.

As we climbed out, Holmes checked his fob watch. "Five and a half minutes. Excellent." He handed the cabbie the promised coin. "Come, Watson, there's no time to lose."

When we entered the foyer, even I could smell the chemical traces of fresh paint��"old enough to be dry, for there were no signs or barriers erected, but new enough to be apparent in the air. Sunshine glimmered down through a skylight, the rays refracted by an immense crystal chandelier into shards of light that patterned the walls. White arches lined the room, dripping with delicate filigree.

"I believe we're on the right scent," Holmes laughed. "The odour of the type of clay used in the pigment to create that light, golden hue is distinctive. Now to verify." Holmes walked to the desk and spoke briefly with the clerk. Moments later, he returned to my side with an expression of triumph on his face. "A man matching Roberson's description checked into the hotel one week ago. He has not yet checked out, nor has he been seen leaving the hotel today. We have him! All we have to do now is find ourselves a hidden alcove here in the lobby and wait."

"What's our plan?" I asked. In his pique, Holmes had yet to tell me what he intended to do once we found the man.

"We should avoid a direct altercation if possible. We will follow him, discreetly, and wait until he posts your imprudent scribblings. Once they are out of his hands, it should be simple enough to retrieve them from the postman." He added, with a delicate shrug of nonchalance, "I've intercepted mail before."

We found a table tucked discreetly behind one of the lobby's elegant, fluted pillars and we waited there for our quarry. It was nearly midday before Roberson appeared with a plain, brown packet tucked under his arm.

His time spent in gaol had changed his appearance. Gone were the soft, refined features I held in my darker memories. Youth and beauty had been stripped away by the hard decades, revealing the spindly, jagged ugliness of his soul. Still, as altered as he was, I couldn't fail to recognize those deep set eyes, plump lips and haughty mien. I shuddered at the sight of him.

Beside me, Holmes stiffened in his chair and leaned forward to touch my arm, whether to caution or to console, I couldn't be sure. Roberson was calm and assured. He did not peer about at his surroundings like a man being hunted, but sauntered across the lobby with insouciance and headed out the door.

We waited a few seconds more, Holmes coiled tight as a spring, ready to leap from his chair as soon as we could be sure that Roberson had truly left. At last, Holmes hissed, "Watson, come quickly. We can't let ourselves lose him."

Roberson was easy enough to trail. He moved at a steady and moderate speed and made no attempts to conceal his path in the throng of pedestrians who crowded the pavement. I was sure he was oblivious to our pursuit, yet I kept one hand in my pocket near my revolver nevertheless. I remembered how remarkably fast he could draw a weapon, even in the days while when he had all the appearance of harmlessness.

Then, at the corner of Davies and Grosvenor Street, the unforeseen occurred. Roberson collided hard with another man who was crossing his path. Holmes and I froze where we stood and watched man and packet fall to the ground.

"Holmes!" I pointed to the unknown young man who was even now rushing away with a brown packet under his arm.

"Roberson has one, too."

I turned to see that Roberson indeed carried a packet identical in size and shape. "Good Lord, they each have one!"

"Well spotted, Watson."

I ignored his temper. "Did you see what happened during the collision? Did they switch packets?"

Holmes hissed in frustration. "There were too many damned people in the way. I could observe nothing for certain, only that two packets were dropped."

"Do you think he planned it to throw us off?"

"Planned or not, we can't take the chance. I'll pursue Roberson; you follow the other gentleman. Go, Watson, quickly!" He rushed away and vanished in the crowd.

By now the other man had travelled so far that I could see only the top of his hat, and only that because of its distinctive blue colour. I hurried to catch up. Once he was well within my sight, he, like Roberson, was easy to follow. Within minutes I approached a large edifice with a sign that named it "Berkeley Mansions". The doorman greeted the fellow with an easy familiarity that implied he was either a resident or a frequent guest. Either way, Holmes would know how to find him. I returned to Grosvenor Street to wait for Holmes. I did not have to wait long.

"Luck may be with us today," he said as soon as he was at my side. "Roberson no longer has the incriminating papers and was, in fact, furious to have lost them. Do you know where the young man went?"

Pleased to finally have something useful to offer Holmes after all his upbraiding, I told him all I had seen as I led him towards Berkeley Mansions. It was wonderful to see hope again in his bright eyes instead of displeasure and grim resolve. When we reached our destination, Holmes darted up to the door with something close to his usual spryness.

"Excuse me," Holmes put on a charming smile as he spoke to the doorman, "A man whom I believe lives here dropped something of value. Might you give me his name and room number? He's a tall man, young, fair haired, wearing a grey suit with impeccable creases, a vacant expression, and an odd blue hat."

"Ah, yes, that would be Mr. Wooster in apartment 3A."

"Thank you." Holmes handed the man a coin and swept into the building. I trailed close behind and muttered to him as soon as I was sure we were out of earshot.

"I tell you, Holmes, the ease with which you lie frightens me."

"I did not lie. Mr. Wooster did indeed drop something."

"Manipulated the truth, then," I retorted.

"Real truth is firm, unyielding. It cannot be manipulated. Only a person's mind, with its faulty understanding, can be subjected to such influence." He assessed me with narrow eyes. "You should know that as well as anyone, purveyor of romance and distortions that you are."

So, I was not forgiven yet after all.
