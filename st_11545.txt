From the pen of Bertram W. Wooster: In which an ultimatum is issued.

Chapter 11: Sacrifice

Holmes was away for many hours. Jeeves puttered about the flat, tidying here, cleaning there. I envied him his chores, which was a new sensation for me, seeing that I had always kept a valet precisely so I won't have to be bothered with work. In situations such as these, however--when, after Watson's arrest I dare not leave the house for fear of being snatched up by Roberson's cronies and desperate for something to keep my mind off my predicament--I wished that I had some simple task to perform, some job that would keep me occupied while we waited for Holmes to return. The thrilling novel I'd been reading was no distraction as my current life held more twists and turns and hair-raising terror than the book. I sat at the piano, plunking out a melody, but every tune turned glum and desultory.

It occurred to me that there was nothing in particular stopping me from participating in the daily chores. Well, nothing beyond the fact that I hadn't the faintest idea where to begin, although dusting always looked straightforward enough. Seeing that Jeeves was no longer merely my valet, it might even be appropriate for me to share the labour.

"I say, Jeeves?" I called. He drifted in from the kitchen immediately.

"Yes, sir?"

"Can I give you a hand about the flat?"

"That won't be necessary, sir." Jeeves, for some reason, looked alarmed at the prospect. His eyes widened a full millimetre and his brows twitched.

"Perhaps I should be clearer," I began. "I should like to help. I need something to do or else I'll go mad. Perhaps I can wash the dishes?" Jeeves's subtle look of horror grew, and if he were a less reserved bird I suspect he would have run to the dish rack and clutched them protectively. "Or," I continued before he could deny me, "I could do something simpler, like dust."

Before Jeeves could reply, the untimely doorbell rang and Jeeves floated off to answer it. "What is it, Jeeves?" I asked.

"A telegram, sir, for Mr. Holmes."

"Holmes? Who'd send him a telegram here? Or is it that Roberson scoundrel again."

"Indeed it is," Jeeves replied tersely, tearing open the telegram.

"Jeeves! What are you doing?"

"Reading the missive, sir."

"I can see that, but it was addressed to Mr. Holmes. You can't just read other people's mail."

"I beg to differ, sir; I just have."

"Ah. Well. In that case, what does it say? Anything important? Anything that might help us bring the dastardly villain to justice?"

"There is nothing of use immediately apparent, merely a proposal for yet another hostage exchange." Jeeves crossed the room and passed the telegram to me. It said:

S HOLMES

DOCTOR EXCHANGE FOR YOU. COME ALONE TO DISCUSS. EIGHT HOURS TO DECIDE.

TTP4C2L5W1P6C1L8W3P1C4L9W9P3C4L4W1

M ROBERSON

"Oh dear," I said when I'd finished reading. "Things are getting soupier and soupier. What do you suppose all those letters and numbers at the end are about? Some sort of code?"

"Yes, sir. I suspect that a specific text is required to decipher it. The 'p' for page, 'l' for line and 'w' for word."

"What about the 'c?'" A thought struck me; Jeeves wasn't the only one in this flat with brains, after all. "I have it! 'C' is for chapter, right?"

Jeeves pursed his lips in a most distracting fashion. "It is doubtful, sir. With the page number given, knowledge of which chapter would be unnecessary."

"You're right, of course." I thought the matter through further. "Unless," I stopped, thinking the idea through from all sides. It held up under scrutiny. "Unless the page number isn't the page number of the book, but the page within the chapter specified. So that first bit would be page four of chapter two."

"Perhaps," Jeeves replied. "It would explain why the page numbers are uniformly small."

My spirits glowed to hear the approval in Jeeves's voice. It wasn't often that one Bertram Wooster got one over on Jeeves, mentally speaking, or really in any other way, either, so it warmed the whatsits of my heart to have said something that Jeeves found worthwhile.

"What about that double 't' at the beginning?" I asked. "What does that mean?"

"That is undoubtedly referring to the title of the text."

"Double 't,' eh?" I pondered. "There's that popular new war novel by G. Scott Wayforth Tell Tommy. Or the old Rosie M. Banks romance, Tilda's Trick." I frowned in thought but no other titles came to mind. "I suppose it's too late in the evening now to hop down to a book store and have a browse through the shelves."

"Roberson wants Mr. Holmes to be able to break the code; therefore, it will be a book Roberson could expect Mr. Holmes to have in his possession. I doubt that the works of G. Scott Wayforth or Rosie M. Banks meet the criteria."

"What book do you think it is? We can't go through his valise to see if he happens to have a book that begins with t-squared."

Jeeves raised his eyebrow in a message so clear he might as well have said aloud, "Why can't we biff off to do just that?" Only Jeeves, of course, would have said it in a much more proper and logophilic way.

I replied to his unspoken comment. "Oh no, we couldn't possibly. He's sure to notice if we go mucking about in his things; he's Sherlock Holmes after all. He probably has the position of each sock perfectly memorized. No, we'd never get away with it, and I don't think he's the type to take a breach of privacy in a kindly and forgiving manner."

"As you say, sir."

"I do say, Jeeves." With that argument firmly concluded in my favour, I absently played a few minor chord progressions on the piano, muttering possible book titles to myself but coming up flat--with the book titles, not the chords, which were in perfect tune.

Jeeves coughed politely, and I paused in my musical and mental wanderings. "Have you considered, sir, that the telegram gives a limited amount of time in which to act to save Dr. Watson, and that Mr. Holmes is not here, nor is there any indication of when he might return. If Mr. Holmes does not make an appearance within the allotted eight hours, it may fall to us to negotiate more time, in which case it would be essential to ascertain as much as we can."

"You mean," I translated his words into something more resembling standard English. "You think we should do whatever is necessary to crack the code, up to and including searching someone else's belongings, because Dr. Watson's safety may be left in our hands if Holmes doesn't return?"

"Precisely, sir."

"Well, when you put it that way...I still don't like the idea, but it seems we have no choice. Lead on, Jeeves."

Jeeves inclined his head and glided off towards the guest room, with me trailing behind. It required no great feat of deduction to determine which bags belonged to Holmes and which to Watson. Watson's side of the room was neat and tidy, his spare clothes hung in the wardrobe. Holmes's side of the room, however, looked like it had already been rummaged through and not very subtly at that, more of a "bags dumped out over the floor and then kicked around for a bit" sort of job. The sight reassured me a good deal about our actions. Surely even Holmes wouldn't notice a disturbance to this chaos.

Rummaging about we found assorted clothes, a multiplex knife, a recently published booklet of maps of London streets (the title of said booklet contained no "t"s) , a set of lock picks, pomade and a shaving kit, and a fine fountain pen wrapped in brown paper. Two pistols were in the dresser drawer next to the shirts along with a small, leather bound notebook that on closer examination proved to belong to Watson.

I gingerly lifted up one of the pistols to paw through the clothes underneath. "This thing is heavier than it looks."

Jeeves drifted to my side. "An Enfield Mark One, if I'm not mistaken." Jeeves carefully took it from my hands. "Commonly issued to army servicemen in the eighties. Both firearms appear to be loaded, sir, so take care handling them."

I paused with my fingers on the second pistol. "Eh, why don't you deal with it, Jeeves? You know a dashed sight more about guns than I do. Last time someone put one in my hand I shattered an antique stained glass window and nearly took out the gardener. I wouldn't want to accidentally shoot something with the En-whatits, or the--" I waved my hand in the direction of the other revolver.

"The Webley Mark Six, adopted by British forces in 1915. A powerful .455 calibre revolver and--"

"Yes, Jeeves, I'm sure it's a very nice gun, now please move it so I can search the drawer."

Jeeves did as requested, but the drawer revealed nothing of interest, just shirts and handkerchiefs. "Dash it all! There's nothing!" I exclaimed. "No books that start with 'TT.' Bad enough that we ransacked a guest's room, worse that we don't even have anything to show for it."

"Not entirely, sir," Jeeves said, picking up a well-read and dishevelled copy of today's paper from the nightstand. Frowning, I tilted my head quizzically.

"I don't get it, Jeeves. It's just a newspaper."

"It is The Times, sir," he replied with a heavy inflection on the name.

"Yes, what of it? That's the same paper I get every��"" The proverbial light bulb switched on. "Oh, I see! The Times, of course! The. Times. Two 't's. That's very clever." I grinned.

I think Jeeves would have rolled his eyes if such a thing were proper. As it was, his eyelids twitched a little bit, and he sighed quietly.

"Wait, no, there's a hitch," I said. "The Times doesn't have chapters, so what does the 'c' stand for?"

"The 'c' in the code stands for column not chapter."

"Brilliant, Jeeves! Bring it into the sitting room and let's test your theory out." Action followed word, and before long I was perched on the sofa. After some heated debate about propriety, Jeeves hesitantly took a seat beside me. I read out the code on the telegram while Jeeves manned the newspaper. The message was short. It said: The Spotted Dog, Ratcliffe.

"Some sort of pub or inn from the sounds of it," I said.

"It is undoubtedly the location whither Mr. Holmes is to betake himself if he wishes to accept the deal on offer."

"That's a rather rotten end of town. Not a place for a gentleman."

"I believe that is the point, sir."

With the code broken, we settled in to wait. Jeeves and I didn't discuss what we would do if Holmes didn't appear, but I assumed that we'd head on down to this Spotted Dog place and tell Roberson or whoever was there on his behalf that Holmes would have liked to have come himself, but wasn't available and could we please reschedule. Fortunately for us all��"for I didn't think much of our chances of success had we tried to renegotiate��"Holmes returned shortly after sunset. He ignored Jeeves's offer for a drink and immediately took to prowling about the sitting room like a hungry and feral cat, hissing and spitting recriminations.

"It was bad enough in the days the police force was merely incompetent. Now instead of accidentally impeding me, they are actively hindering my efforts, damn the lot of them! Between them and the criminals it's like a parasitic infestation has taken hold of the city. Roberson has gone underground and thanks to all the filth obstructing the way, he's vanished from my sight somewhere in the East End. Damn his eyes, and damn my eyes, too, for ever giving in to his demands. I should have anticipated he'd do something like this. I should never have let myself compromise my principles, and I wish to God that I could take those sodding jewels and strangle him with them."

He said a few worse things, too, but I blush to repeat them, even in writing. I certainly didn't expect to hear such words emanating from his mouth. I'd rarely heard a gentleman use that sort of language outside the New York speakeasies. "Don't be so hard on yourself, old chap. You saved my life; what else could you have done?"

"I could have left you with Roberson," he snarled. "Better you than John."

The words pierced my spirit like a splinter buried in the tender flesh of the hand. I couldn't fault him. It would take a man even colder and more inhuman than Holmes to bear the threat to his companion with equanimity. All the same, it was difficult to hear him say that under the present circs, if he had to do the last few days all over again he'd leave me to be murdered. I wilted under such scorn and could not reply. Jeeves, however, manfully stepped up to the plate.

"Although I sympathize with your situation, sir," Jeeves said to Holmes in a very unsympathetic tone, "I suggest you keep such sentiments to yourself while you are here as Mr. Wooster's guest."

"You are a hypocrite if you condemn me for ruthlessness. You think I haven't observed what goes on underneath that stoic façade? What heartless deeds have you done to keep your dim-witted lover in this perfect little bubble you've created, this benign facsimile of the real world where burnt toast and stained jackets are thought to be the height of tragedy? Or subtly punished him for straying from your master plan, as if you were some ostensibly benevolent lord, a god promising mercy but with total obedience and blind ignorance as the price? Mr. Wooster makes a fine pet, I'm sure, although he surely can't be much of a challenge for you. How long before you tire of his witless nattering? Had Roberson killed him I suspect that no one would have grieved for long. Very likely they'd be grateful for the silence. He--"

With every sentence my spirit withered a little more. I cringed like a dog that's too often seen the unfortunate end of a shoe and my eyes were suspiciously moist about the rims. Jeeves then did the most remarkable thing. He curled his hand into a fist and socked Holmes across the cheek, hard enough to knock Holmes back a few paces. Jeeves, as you may recall, is of the tall and broad shouldered mould, built rather along the lines of a rugby player, and although I'd rarely seen him use physical force, when he chose to do so it was as much a force to be reckoned with as his marvellous mind. The acrid drips of vitriolic words came to a halt as Holmes touched his bruised face with an expression of utter shock. He chuckled darkly and then became still, staring out into nothing.

The moment stretched on. My heart was thudding in my ears and my stomach was queasy. I couldn't take the awkward silence any longer, so I opened my mouth and said the first thing that popped to my mind. "You received a telegram while you were out. It's over there on the sideboard."

Holmes glanced at me, then the sideboard, then Jeeves, then me again. Jeeves, for his part, had his best "aloof valet" look on, and were the ridge of Holmes's cheekbone not turning a splendid red I would have wondered if I'd hallucinated Jeeves walloping him a good one, or if he had, in fact, merely asked Holmes if he wanted a snifter.

Holmes padded over to the sideboard and swiped the telegram up with a swift gesture. Moments later he reached for the copy of The Times that Jeeves had left nearby.

"Oh, the code there says, 'The Spotted Dog, Ratcliffe.' Jeeves and I sorted it out while you were gone."

He arched his brow and fixed me with a cold, grey eye. "Did you indeed? I would ask why you were opening my telegrams, but I suspect that yours was not the intellect behind the initiative." He flicked a quick look at Jeeves.

I shifted on my feet like a nervous schoolboy. "Jeeves thought that since we're all in this together, we should know what Roberson is saying, what? And it was a good thing we opened it, because if you hadn't returned, it would have been up to us to save Watson."

"Thank the Lord that such dire action was averted," Holmes muttered. Jeeves stiffened and Holmes stepped back and defensively half raised his arm.

Things were looking like they might get violent again, so I spoke up, hoping to focus their attention on weightier matters. "Well, we're all three of us here, now, in which party is included the two brainiest coves in the Northern Hemisphere. That being you two, obviously. So, what sort of plan are we going to think up? What are we going to do?" I asked.

"We are going to do nothing. I am going to go to The Spotted Dog."

"I think that would be most unwise," Jeeves said.

"Forgive me if I'm disinclined to take the advice of a man who just assaulted me."

"My feelings about and reaction to your abominable behaviour are irrelevant. My concern is not simply for your well being��"which will surely be compromised if you put yourself at Roberson's mercy��"but for Mr. Wooster's and Dr. Watson's as well."

"Believe me when I say that no one is more concerned for Watson's well being than I am," Holmes rasped. "Roberson is not bluffing. Nor is he lying about the terms. For all his many faults, he prides himself on always keeping his word once given. If I give myself up he will let Watson go, and will likewise have no further reason to target you or Mr. Wooster. All three of you will be safe, whereas at this moment none of us are safe while Roberson is at large. It seems a logical exchange."

"But what about you?" I said, horrified at the idea of Holmes blithely handing himself over to that monster. I still remembered the feel of his pistol pressed against my head.

Holmes shrugged, displaying a complete lack of concern. "I've escaped from more precarious situations in the past. Once Watson is freed, I'll have only myself to worry about, a circumstance I'm far more comfortable with. There will be no more distractions."

Jeeves spoke, "I suspect that Dr. Watson would object to this plan in the strongest possible terms."

"As do I," I added. "Whatever harsh words may have passed between us, which, incidentally, I'm more than willing to forgive, the idea of you running off to confront that awful man alone, while the rest of us sit around and drink champagne cannot be count...counted...counter..."

"Countenanced, sir," Jeeves muttered.

"Yes, countenanced. It cannot be countenanced," I concluded firmly. "Besides, if you biff off, our little group will be down one genius, and I for one have no intention of just letting Roberson roam free. When we attempt to bring him to justice we will be severely hampered in our game if he's run off with our nine iron."

"Patience is called for," Jeeves said. "I'm sure there are other ways to see to it that the charges against Dr. Watson are dropped. You must have been working on some plan to that effect before the telegram arrived. Do not abandon your options."

Holmes's eyes were glassy and blank. I couldn't be sure if he actually saw Jeeves or just happened to be facing his general direction. "Yes," he said at last. "Options." He stared vacantly into space for a few seconds more before he returned to himself with a slow and heavy blink. "We still have a few hours to decide. This will require some thought. You may as well dine; regardless of what happens it will probably be a long night tonight and you'll want to keep your energy up."

I retreated to my room to change into my evening suit, while Jeeves set to preparing supper in the kitchen. When I emerged, the flat was quiet, the door to the guest room closed. I assumed that Holmes was holed up inside, and was, quite frankly, glad to be rid of his company for a while. It was churlish of me to think so poorly of my guest, especially since his ill-temper was on account of what must have been deep distress. Still, sympathy can only take one so far, and I'd suffered enough verbal abuse for one evening. It was my dear hope that with a few hours alone, Holmes would purge the worst of his black mood from his system and we could then all three of us work together to save poor Watson.

When Jeeves rapped on his door to call him to supper, however, there was no reply. A quick search of the room revealed that he had changed clothes--my sorry old waistcoat and apricot shirt were piled on the floor--and left the flat unnoticed while Jeeves and I were busy. Both pistols were still in the dressing table where we'd left them, a scrap of paper folded nearby with Watson's name written on the front in a sharp and angular hand.

"Oh, damn," I swore. I reckoned if there was ever a situation that justified swearing, this was it.
