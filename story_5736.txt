They had about given up on the treasure map that had been 
behind the photo Billy's grandfather had left as what 
seemed a measly inheritance.

None of the features seemed to exist where the map said 
they did - at least not in *THIS* era - but a sparkle in 
the dirt distracted Billy just as a brighter spark 
flashed overhead.  He dug his fingernails around the edge 
of the gold disk and pulled it free of the soft 
limestone.

"Wow!  This must have been here when the whole area was 
covered in ocean."

Suzy brushed the surface and the ruby-like gem that had 
caught Billy's eye glowed malevolently.

"I don't think you should put that on, Billy."

"Why?  Look, the chain is still flexible."  He freed the 
grit between the links and slipped it over his head.

"See.  Nothing happened."

A shadow covered the area and the siblings looked up.

"I had to open my big mouth!"

A burst of light surrounded Billy - and everything went 
dark.

Unseen now, another beam of bright light surrounded Billy 
and he was lifted through the air and into a hatch while 
his sister looked up in amazement at the bottom of the 
unusual craft.

Billy picked up speed as he approached and crashed 
headfirst into the ceiling.  The door closed to form a 
floor for his unconscious body.

---

"Greetings Williamjameskent.  Do not be afraid."

There was no sound - Billy was sure of that - and yet he 
still heard the words in his head.

"Who are you?"

"My name is not important as I have little time to 
explain before I must leave you lest I expose you to more 
danger than I must.  There is an evil presence 
approaching your planet and you have been chosen as its 
defender."

"Me!  Why me?"

"A scan of the population showed us that you possess a 
"Z" chromosome as well as the normal male "XY" pair.  
This is most unusual but makes it easier for us to 
enhance your physical form so you can resist the invader 
and fight back on shis terms."

"Shis?"

"The invader has a hermaphroditic form that just happens 
to be compatible with a human's. Your Z chromosome allows 
you to morph between male and female forms allowing you 
to seduce shim in both shis aspects."

"Ignoring the issue of any seduction for a minute, what 
the hell do you mean I can turn into a girl?  I've always 
been a boy!"

"Our investigations show your parents were world-renowned 
virologists and geneticists before their fatal - and 
mysterious - car crash.  Though they kept their 
backgrounds and research secret from you, their 
experimentation attempted to produce a new species, "Homo 
trans", who would break the glass ceiling and end pay 
inequality.  You are the first of that new species and 
are to be the Adam of your new race."

"Adam, shmadam.  I can't even get a girlfriend!"

"Puberty for _Homo trans_ comes later, after you have 
experienced your normal human puberty - though it is 
faster.  In fact our medical tests reveal, among other 
things, that you should pass through it in the next nine 
hours.  During that time your body will cycle between 
male and female forms until you learn to control it.  You 
will need to be careful you do not fall pregnant during 
that time as your Z chromosome is also responsible for 
the hyper-pheromone that will drive males wild while you 
are in your female form and females when you are male."

"Oh great!  Lock me up now,  What were the 'among other 
things' your tests revealed?"

"The collision as you entered our vessel appears to have 
jarred your central nervous system so that your senses 
will be much more acute.  Indeed you may find yourself 
with new senses that you didn't have such as a 
kinaesthesia that is more like an internal GPS or the 
ability to see electrical current.

"In addition, the static electricity that built up on our 
ship as we passed through your planet's atmosphere 
discharged through your body when we neared the surface.  
This seems to have opened some neural pathways in your 
brain."

"Oh my god!  What does that mean?"

"Well, from the areas affected we expect your memory, 
logical and cognitive powers should increase over time 
and there may be some expansion into mental control over 
your environment.  The sort of things referred to as ESP 
- telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation; that sort of 
thing."

"Maybe I'll be able to understand what that Master PC 
program I was given actually does.  This is really cool."

"Oh sorry.  I will adjust our thermostat."

"That is not necessary.  Is there any downside to the 
lightning?"

"To the static discharge.  Er, well actually, it caused 
the medallion you wore around your neck to fuse into your 
breastbone.  It doesn't appear to be doing any harm but 
trying to remove it would leave a hole in your chest.  
Sorry."

"Great!  Whatever next!"

Ignoring the rhetorical nature of the question the alien 
replied, "Nothing actually.  We were going to return you 
to your sibling."

"Suzie!  Oh my god.  Is she alright?  Did she get hit by 
the lightning?"

"The static discharge went to ground through the highest 
conductor.  Your sibling was kneeling on the ground with 
her forehead pressed to the grass with her gluteus 
maximus raised so that the surface presented to the 
discharge was fully rounded rather than coming to a 
point.  It reduced the probability of grounding through 
her body and increased the probability of it through 
yours.  She is unharmed."

Without any formal goodbye, Billy found himself being 
propelled through the alien spaceship in their version of 
a wheelchair as though being discharged from a hospital.  
As he went he considered how his genome had been modified 
by his parents, his body enhanced by the aliens, his 
brain function unencumbered by the lightning and by a 
near-concussion.  It had been some day.

His musings meant he failed to notice the slight sting as 
an alien wasp-like creature injected an egg capsule under 
his skin.  An examination of the creature may have 
revealed that it had been mutated by the exposure to 
cosmic rays during the flight from its home world.

"Now all I have to do is find out what this medallion 
is."

An eerie voice echoed from his diaphragm.  "You bear the 
seal imprisoning the daemon 'Lor Tnoc'.  While I am in 
your possession your merest wish regarding the actions of 
the mortals in your presence will be my command."

"You mean you're like a genie that will grant me wishes?" 

"Didn't you listen!  Those people in your presence will 
be compelled to obey your every whim!  That's it buster."

The beam that had lifted Billy into the sky lowered him 
again.  He looked as the unmoving lump that was his 
sister grew larger.

"Suzie?"  There was a sudden rush of air around them as 
the space shop suddenly took off.  The shadow vanished 
and Billy blinked his nictitating eyelids as the sudden 
sunlight made his eyes water.

"Suzie!  Why are you just staying there?  Get up off your 
knees."

The teenage girl sprang to her feet and stood as though 
"at ease" on a parade ground but keeping her eyes faced 
downwards.

"As you command, Master."

Billy just stood there, stunned.

---

The sun shone brightly above the clouds as well.  Resting 
in the cottonwool-like mists Apollo, Pallas Athena and 
Aphrodite chuckled.

"You can be a real bitch sometimes Aph.  You know that 
don't you!"
