*** August 28, 12:45pm - Nancy

There hadn't been anything inherently sexist in Nancy and 
her aunt being given the job of looking after their 
families and then the women who had been brought in.  Deb 
had sent her son off with her brother and his family when 
she only had five family members to look after.

When Nancy's family had joined Deb they added another 
four people who now needed their care.  Her father Seth 
took the opportunity to check out the grounds of St 
Ignatius' College and ended up bringing back a human 
chain of teachers, boarding students and a live in 
caretaker.  They got them settled and then Nancy went 
with her father to raid what was left in the kitchen.

There was little to eat and most of the bottles of drink 
were warm.  The freezer was still running and there was 
some ice so they chilled down some pitchers of water 
instead.  That at least would help the others cope with a 
mixture of salty snacks and sweet candy; neither very 
nourishing.

When her cousin Peter had turned up in a bus she had gone 
with him and her father to get supplies for the women who 
would be joining them.

They had taken almost all of the men with them and Seth 
had learned that, while driving a bus was different to 
his sedan, it wasn't all that difficult provided he 
didn't take the corners too tight.

It had seemed heartbreaking at first when they exchanged 
the men and boys for a load of schoolgirls and a couple 
of the nuns at a nearby convent.  They were condemning 
one lot to death while saving another.  It was hard to 
play god like that.

They had exchanged the bus for Seth's car after dropping 
their load of girls back with Nancy's aunt and went 
"shopping".

In some respects it had turned out easier than they had 
expected.  Many of the shelves of the supermarket had 
been cleared of stock when the illness first started 
taking hold and the deliveries to replace them had been 
interrupted when the drivers and shop staff also fell 
blind on the job.

Fortunately there was enough warning that no driver fell 
blind at the wheel.  Seth drove around the sparsely 
filled car park before they spotted a truck and a semi-
trailer at the loading dock behind the supermarket.

He pulled up and found they were in luck.  The larger 
vehicle had only been half unloaded and the smaller was 
still full.  There was a hand operated forklift on the 
dock and they sorted through the storage area for items 
they could use.  Cartons made it easy; it would have been 
far more time consuming if they had had to take 
individual packets.

They loaded their selections onto pallets and eventually 
manoeuvred them into position inside the trailer.  Peter 
suggested they take the lift with them to help unload and 
in case they needed it elsewhere.  Seth and Nancy thought 
that was a good idea and it was slipped under one of the 
last pallets and the trailer doors swung closed.

"If you take the semi Uncle Seth I should be able to 
manage the other truck", said Peter who then turned to 
his attractive cousin.  "Unless you want to have a go?"

"No", said Nancy, "Let me practice when it's empty first.  
I'll drive the car back.  Where are the keys Dad?"

That's when it hit all three of them.  Keys!

The two men went looking in their respective cabs.  No 
luck.

"Damn!" said Seth.  Peter was thinking something a little 
worse.

"If the trucks are here the drivers might be too", 
suggested Nancy.  "We may as well have a look around."

"Definitely not just a pretty ... face", Peter thought 
looking at a totally different part of her anatomy and 
somewhat abashed that he hadn't thought of it but willing 
to pay credit where it was due.

They entered the store from the rear and looked at the 
mess spread over the floors.  The weren't the first to 
come scavenging but they at least could see what was in 
the packets and could avoid the display stands that 
others had knocked over.

Burst bags and the spilled contents were in every aisle.  
The freezers seemed to have most of their contents though 
and they were still running.  Someone had been prepared 
to snack on a mixture of thawed frozen peas, ice-cream 
and chocolate bars but the TV dinners, pizza and turkey 
rolls needed cooking and had been left once a couple had 
been opened and identified.

The trio quietly checked out the people who were 
scattered around the centre in the hopes that they could 
find the drivers.  There weren't as many as the car park 
would have suggested, perhaps they had wandered off and 
gotten lost.  Nancy hoped the drivers were still there.  
Somewhere.

They passed the vacant shops, most secured by owners who 
were then unable to come in themselves or who had pulled 
down the shutters as their personal darkness had 
descended.  

They checked out a camping store which was still open.  
Enamel and stainless steel cups and bowls would be 
perfect.  With so many people who couldn't see where they 
were reaching or where they were going breakable glass 
and china would be a pain, probably literally.  Peter ran 
back to get a shopping trolley and they cleared the 
shelf, adding flashlights and gas lanterns with butane 
cylinders to another trolley Nancy retrieved.

The displayed sleeping bags made them think of the 
furniture store down the road.  Mattresses would be more 
comfortable and they had blankets and sheets there as 
well.  Once they cleared out the semi they could bring it 
back and load up; IF they could find those keys.

Realising they couldn't spend a lot of time, they left 
the trolleys where they could collect them on the way 
back and stepped out a little faster.

In a hardware store Seth led them to the hand and garden 
tool displays.  "Not all the stores are open and we may 
need to break in somewhere.  It's better to have the 
tools now than to have to chase around looking when time 
might be important."

They selected a sledge hammer, an axe and two pinch bars 
in different sizes.  "We're armed for destruction.  Let's 
hope we get a chance to use some tools constructively."

That reminded Peter.  "Actually I'm armed as well."  He 
drew the automatic from his pocket.

"Be careful with that", warned his uncle.  "Why on Earth 
are you carrying that in your pocket?"

"Don't worry", the young man reassured them.  "The 
magazine is in my other pocket.  I don't want a loaded 
gun going off next to my nuts thank you very much!"

He put it away and they continued their search.

They tracked them down a little later, together in a 
liquor store.  Realising they had nothing to lose when 
everyone around them went blind as well they had agreed 
to drown their sorrows and go out with a splash.

One had done just that.

"Stay back Nancy."  Seth had noticed the colour of the 
lips of the man stretched out on the floor amidst a 
scattered collection of empty bottles.  A trail of watery 
vomit led over his chin and neck, staining the shirt 
which showed an absence of respiratory movement.

Peter remained with his cousin, not eager to approach 
what he assumed to be his first dead body.  There was no 
horror; it looked more like he was sleeping, other than 
the mess on the floor and the stained area on the front 
of his pants where his relaxed sphincters no longer held 
back his bodily wastes.

Noticing the embroidered monogram on his shirt Seth 
reluctantly patted the man's pockets and found a key-ring 
in his pants.  He had to turn him slightly and his 
stomach churned as the faecal smell wafted over him.  He 
grabbed them and stepped back as quickly as possible.

Seth wasn't sure whether it was better to leave the body 
there or move it out into the walkway.  Either would be 
distasteful later and he preferred to leave it for now.  
It was something they would have to discuss if they were 
to avoid the illnesses a city full of corpses would 
bring.

A sound behind the counter brought the others into the 
store and the trio found the other driver merrily 
inebriated to such a state that his legs were no longer 
functional.  He had almost finished a bottle of whisky 
and was reaching around for another.

"Hello", he slurred when he heard them.  "Do you want a 
drink with me?  Only this one's about empty and I can't 
find another.  Have you got one?"

"Hello.  I'll find one for you.  But you better give me 
your keys; you're in no condition to drive."

"Thash right.  I'm blind drunk!"  He laughed raucously as 
he patted his shirt pocket and extracted a key on a fob.  
"Here you are.  Where's my whishky den?"

Seth put a bottle into his hand and another two by his 
side then picked up the keys from where the drunk had 
dropped them.  "Here you are then.  Drink up."

Nancy was handed the tools and the men grabbed a carton 
of beer and another of spirits.  They left the store and 
all three hoped acute alcohol poisoning would allow the 
poor man a pleasant enough ending.

---

The groceries were unloaded from the semi by the simple, 
conceptually if not in practice, process of passing each 
carton along a human chain.  With a couple of sighted 
people at each end the biggest problem once they were in 
place was to keep the speed down so bottlenecks didn't 
occur.  It was worth the hassles to get people organised 
just so they had something to take their minds off their 
fate; not having to carry each box inside themselves was 
a bonus for the sighted.


*** August 28, 7:00-11:00 pm - Nancy

It had turned out to be a longer day than they had 
expected and it was by no means close to over.  There 
were just over 200 people to be fed and settled for the 
night and they were all tired.

The women spread around the gymnasium were at least going 
to live.  There was no such hope for the millions 
throughout the city and the country or the billions who 
would die over the rest of the world.

Nancy's second collection trip out was not much better 
than the first.  She helped return those medicos who for 
one reason or another didn't want to join them but at 
least she got to track down some of her own girlfriends, 
together with some "eligible" neighbours and sisters.

It wasn't a fast process compared to raiding the hospital 
for young women her Uncle Len's party had missed or been 
unable to collect earlier.

Though her spiel got spruced up as she repeated it, each 
person still needed time to make up their mind, to plead 
for their family and finally to say their goodbyes.

"Hello.  It's Nancy Pike here.  Is anyone home?"  This 
tended to be followed by a tearful hug though she fled 
from one bloody lounge room where a friend's family 
suicide pact nearly broke her heart.  After that she 
refused to go in if no-one answered her call.

She tended to take the person to one side; "Some of my 
family can still see and we are trying to save some 
others so I'm here to see if you want to join us."

This was the worst bit.  Having raised their spirits with 
rescue she then had to make it clear that the rescue was 
far more personal.

"Can you tell me what your father/mother/big brother 
does?" 

"I'm sorry but we can't take your family."
 
"We can take your sister(s) but no-one else."

Sometimes it was a truthful delaying tactic; "We might be 
able to collect your dog later."  It might make a good 
guard dog though she wasn't sure what from.

Once it was better news; "We can take your parents and 
your sister."

In each case her Aunt Deb and/or her Uncle Len would have 
a talk to the parents.  They would point out the problems 
they faced, the solution they felt was necessary and the 
option where at least their daughters would be saved.  
Most accepted it and pressured their girls to go onto the 
bus.

Before they did however, each was made to clearly 
understand what would be expected from them.  They would 
be the mothers for a new generation that they hoped would 
not succumb to the disease that was even then wiping out 
the civilisation that had taken thousands of years to 
reach its current state.  They would have some choice in 
partner but would have to have babies in return for their 
keep.

None of her friends or the neighbours she or they 
considered suitable refused and all left crying, even the 
family who was accepted together.  Nancy was no better 
off.

One of her friends had her boyfriend Paul with her and 
Nancy added him to her list.  He had been working as an 
electrician and they all agreed that was adequate to make 
him valuable.

Her own boyfriend had gone home from university when his 
parents had fallen blind; she hadn't heard from him for 
over a week and now never expected to again.  They hadn't 
been so serious that she was heartbroken but she did miss 
him.  She liked Paul too and figured that he might very 
well keep her company as well.

Given the choice of them both dying (Fran wouldn't leave 
him) or having his girlfriend impregnated by one of 
Nancy's wider family, Paul was willing to encourage Fran 
to agree; Nancy's hints that she might need someone too 
certainly wasn't a turn off.  They finally got on the bus 
with the others.

On their return Nancy and Deb got them settled in a 
relatively empty area of the Gym and went to grab a bite 
to eat and help the others prepare and dispense an 
evening meal.

Earlier in the day Nancy had filled the front of the car 
up with sliced bread at the supermarket and just barely 
fresh enough to eat this was toasted and served with 
Irish Stew heated up in an amazing assortment of 
saucepans.

It was easier to serve the meals in situ rather than try 
to get everyone into a queue to the dining hall and then 
back to their own beds but the size of the task meant 
that many people found their stomachs cramping with 
hunger as the smell of the hot food wafted through the 
gym.

David was running food from the kitchen where bread was 
being toasted under grillers, on gas barbecues and in 
electric toasters plugged into sockets around the wall.

A mountain of empty tin cans was growing where they had 
been tossed inside a near empty store room.  When they 
had a chance the food would be packed away more neatly 
and a decision made regarding how they would dispose of 
their garbage.

Half a dozen of the blind women had been impressed to 
spread butter over the toast as it was ready.  After the 
inactivity of the last day or so they all found it 
uplifting to be able to do something, and something 
useful at that.  When the task was over they returned to 
their beds in much better spirits.



*** August 28, 10:00 pm - Michael & David

As each group finished their meals they were escorted to 
the bathrooms by David and Michael.  While some were 
embarrassed to be taken by the boys, Nancy and Deb needed 
a break too and the boys were reasonably refreshed.  They 
had had a couple of runs getting bedding with the others 
but with more hands the job went faster and was less 
tiring.

They knew how many cubicles were available and each boy 
organised that many people into a centipede and marched 
them down (Left-Right-Left-Right Halt).  Each was 
positioned before a door and their eating utensils put 
next to the wash basins.

Feeling their own way into the cubicles they were given 
time to complete their business.  As each came out they 
were assisted to the basins where they washed their 
hands, their utensils and whatever parts of their bodies 
they deemed necessary with only a flannel wash cloth. By 
the time they had all finished the next group was usually 
just arriving at the door ready to replace them.

At least they had been spared the necessity of having to 
get pads and tampons from the lads.  Realizing that 
approximately a quarter of the women would be 
menstruating at any time, Nancy had insisted that 
adequate supplies were loaded onto the first semi-trailer 
her father had driven back to the school.

He and her cousin Peter, with masculine oversight, hadn't 
even considered the problem but her Aunt Deb had given 
her a big hug when told they were there.  She made sure 
each cubicle had ample supplies and went through the gym 
quietly letting the women know where to look.

As each group performed their ablutions, David was 
intrigued.

Some women were very self-conscious as though the 14 year 
old was staring at their every action.  In many cases 
they were right, his attention being drawn from one to 
the next in turn.  These people tended to only use the 
soapy flannel on face and neck and what exposed skin they 
had, while some of the others dropped dresses onto the 
floor beside them and gave themselves a much wanted wash; 
comfort being far more important than prudery.

On two occasions a women was prepared to remove underwear 
as well and David stood next to them as they washed below 
their breasts and squatted slightly to get their pussies 
nice and clean.  They had heard him come up, his heavier 
breathing was noticeable, but they both enjoyed giving 
him a bit of a thrill.

Michael wasn't quite so lucky but found taking a military 
approach made things much easier to coordinate as did 
those people who caught on and complied.

"Rinse out your cloths for the next person.  Tomorrow we 
will try to get you all toothbrushes - sorry for now.  
Lay your cloth over the front of the basin.  Pick up your 
bowls.  Right Turn.  Left hand on the shoulder of the 
person in front of you.  Mark Time.  Left-Right-Left. 
Forward."

He lead the group past and impressed David who copied his 
brother with his own groups.



*** August 28, 10:30 pm - Kitchen

The blind parents Joanna, Julie and Stan together with 
Joanna's friends Keith and Deirdre were helping Len in 
the kitchen.  Most of them were standing around talking 
but Joanna and Stan were scrubbing pots and pans with 
Len.  It was easy enough to tell by touch when they were 
clean and Len's role was more to supply the dirty and 
take the clean.

Never enthusiastic about washing up, he left them to dry 
overnight rather than waste his strength or time in 
drying them.

Keith was making some suggestions regarding livestock and 
Len was listening while he was rubbing his wife's not so 
tight buns, childishly delighting in the knowledge that 
he could get away with it provided she kept quiet.  She 
reached a wet hand down and squeezed his cock through his 
pants in turn.

"In the long run you are going to need farm animals.  
Fortunately there are plenty around the place and some 
will wait for you to get them.  Sheep and cows out in 
pasture will be okay but it would be useful to get some 
dairy cattle in before they dry up."

"Dry up?" asked Joanna.

"If they aren't milked for a while they stop producing 
until they have another calf.  We can probably find 
stores of cheese to keep us going for a while but fresh 
milk would be better than raiding drug and health stores 
for calcium supplements."

"Okay", said Stan, "we've pencilled in our herd of cattle 
what else?"

"There are a number of farms where the animals are caged 
or penned in; chickens are likely to die if they aren't 
fed in the next day or so.  Both they and pigs would 
probably end up as cannibals.  The chickens could be let 
free to fend but we may as well be getting the eggs.  I 
don't think I'd like to see the results of pigs being set 
free after they've been going wild for a few years; a 
pig's smart and wild boars or a sow with piglets are not 
to be encountered lightly."

No-one said he wasn't likely to ever see a pig, wild or 
not but most thought it.

"If you're talking about cages and pens what about the 
zoo?"  Deirdre's comment stirred them up a bit.

Her husband answered first.  "You can't just let exotic 
animals go free.  They could upset the local balance or 
spread diseases.  And I certainly don't want to meet a 
tiger on the middle of Main Street."

"Most of them are healthier than the wild ones", she 
countered but was willing to concede that man had stuffed 
up the ecological balance with his thoughtless 
introductions both animal and vegetable that she didn't 
want to be responsible for any more.

Having been given yet a few more things to think over Len 
led them back to the gym; he needed to get some sleep if 
he was going to cope with another full day tomorrow.
