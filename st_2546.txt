>When we left off, glasses was pretty much shoving us out the
door to take a shower.
>She probably saw what we looked like.
>I take Glasses' hint and i clasp raven's hand and lift her off
the bed
>At first i'm supporting her, but she seems to have no problem
walking after a short bit.
>We exit birthday girl's room holding hands
>A long hallway between us and the bathroom.
>This hallway is adjacent to the living room.
>Barefoot on cold hardwood floors
>But before that, like every hope and dream i'm shattering for
you, lets talk about holding hands.
>Holding hands is a mathematical nightmare
>First of all we were both covered in various liquids from our
sleeping bag ordeal, so our hands were both a disgusting mixture
of sticky and slippery at the same time.
>Keeping our hands together was like holding onto glue that
hadn't dried yet
>we were pretty much stuck together without taking a good amount
of effort to extract ourselves.
>this wasn't a bad thing

>The hand holding itself is almost more difficult to explain than
everything before this point
>Oh wait no its not, just take your left hand and hold hands with
your right.
>Its like that
>But its a girl *fireworks*
>[Spoiler]I guess its a guy if you swing like that tho
anon[/spoiler]
>[Spoiler]If You don't understand how crazy this psychological
aspect of holding hands with someone is.[/Spoiler]
>[Spoiler]You're connected to them in the most innocent way
possible, its like accidentally brushing skin with another woman
you have a crush on, or accidentally touching someone else's hand
as you go for something.[/Spoiler]
>[Spoiler]There's absolutely no sensation to it at all when you
really think about it[/Spoiler]
>[Spoiler]Its all in your head, and in your head its
amazing[/Spoiler]
>Then comes the Height difference part, luckily raven and I were
about the same height so we can skip that.
>Just know that it's a tactical nightmare to try to figure out
how to hold hands if you're both different heights, because your
hands can't get to a "Resting" position without one person
holding them up.
>Next comes the "Moving while holding hands part"
>walking step in step isn't going to happen unless both of you
have your full attention on doing so. Most of what happens is one
person ends up leading and the other ends up following, which
makes it far less romantic than it would be otherwise.

>As a result, Glasses shoved us out the door with me in the lead
and raven tagging along behind.
>I wasn't dragging her behind me or anything, she was just... out
of it
>kinda in that mode where you just let someone lead you off to
whatever because you don't want to think too much.
>because the house was extremely quiet and dark at whatever
spooky hour of the morning it was, we're absolutely terrified of
making any sounds.
>this and the floor is god damn freezing, stupid hardwood floors
>i'm sure my nipples were as hard as diamonds
>all you can hear are the light pitter patter of our footsteps as
we inch down the hallway
>nothing else is making a sound in the house, just us, and it
sounds like each footstep is a thousand times louder than it
actually is.
>I can happily say you all know what that feels like.
>Not to mention our breathing, smooth but shallow each breath
almost timed in order of one another, i take my turn, she takes
hers. I take my turn, she takes hers.
>This hallway feels like it goes on forever
>After another couple more seconds of small steps down the
hallway
>*CREAK*

>Like a fucking gunshot
>We both jump like four feet in the air as i step on a loose
board
>Because we're both naked there's no rustling or other assorted
sounds panicked teenagers make
>But we were both terrified, we can both sense that
>Just in the way that our earlier breathing has stopped entirely
and we're both holding our breath
>Do not want to be discovered naked in the hallway together by
blondie, homely or birthday girl
>MFW we're only about 60% of the way down this fucking hallway
>Breath still held i take a look back at the girl i've been
leading down this landmine filled hallway of fear
>Tiny bit of light streaming in from a nearby window.
>Raven is a complete mess, her shoulder length hair is sticking
off in every which way, locks of it are tangled and rolling down
her cheeks.
>She's got various wet patches on her cheeks, something gooey
dripping off her ear and her forehead is just her pretty hair
plastered with wetness to her head.
>huge patch of gooey shiny and slimy something all over her lower
jaw and chin
>i wonder what that could be.
>Her eyes catch mine

>Our eyes lock
>I can't really see the colors of them too well, but i know
they're a deep green and my mind fills in the rest
>The kind of color of an unripened lime, or those green rings in
fruit loops or something relatively romantic that i can't really
think of at the moment.
>Emeralds, probably emeralds
>Did i mention i absolutely love eyes, Raven's has definitely
caught me staring at her eyes before.
>Staring into someone's eyes is like the most intimate thing you
can do without physical contact, you can see everything anyone
ever wants to or doesn't want to tell you in how they hold their
gaze to your own.
>Examining the way light reflects off of them, how big each ring
of the iris or pupil is, and the facial expressions that come
along with it.
>Begin to get lost in examining her eyes again
>It's probably been like 2 seconds
>She gets embarrassed and turns averts her eyes.
>Left looking at the side of her face and not the wonderful green
globes i was enjoying.
>youdirtytease.gif

>Quickly scan down the rest of her
>Throat
>Shoulders
>Upper chest
>She's got goosebumps
>I knew it was cold, i'm not a pansy i swear.
>Her breasts are covered in goosebumps
>The thought comes to my mind that goosebumps look hilarious when
you actually look at them.
>her breasts and upper chest is just covered in thousands of tiny
little bumps
>Raven wasn't really that well endowed, A / AA cup breasts
>Small kinda globes of flesh, not big enough to need a Bra (but
she wore one anyway to make them look bigger).
>Probably would look amazing in a Tank top or tight T-shirt
>And she had these tiny pointy nipples that just jutted straight
out
>On second thought she probably had nipples as hard as diamonds
too
>Also would look amazing in a tank top or tight shirt
>Would probably look amazing in anything
>urge to cop a feel rising
>Obviously because i was male and they were breasts, i was
staring
>Raven doesn't like this (She was really self concious about her
chest) and gives me a shove with her other hand.

>We continue our tiptoeing down the cold hallway holding hands
>don't step on any more landmines
>make it to the bathroom with all limbs still attached
>Get to bathroom, i'm the first one there
>Stand outside the door looking in
>Tiny bathtub with a shower and sliding glass doors
>Bathroom is right across from the living room
>Obviously going to wake up everyone if we take a shower here
>Taking turns was not on our agenda
>Raven had scrunched up behind me at this point.
>Had her head resting on my shoulder looking into the bathroom.
>She whispers "Master Bathroom"
>Fuckin brilliant masterplanner she was
>She's obviously been to this house more than i have because i'm
clueless as to where that would be
>I'm standing there looking around trying to figure out where
this secret bathroom is
>"Parents Bedroom" she mumbles
>Oh shit
>Parent's bedroom is all the way across the house
>Only way into that part of the house is across the living room.
>Solid Snake Mode Engaged

>We peek into the living room
>Birthday girl is sprawled out on the couch, her shirt has ridden
up half way up her chest on one side but its completely down to
her pants on the other.
>One pants leg is all the way up to her knee, other is fine.
>Blanket has fallen on the floor, with the bottom part tangled
around her legs
>Clothes do the silliest things when you're asleep
>Homely is all zipped up in a sleeping bag with just her head
sticking out.
>Kinda cute face when she's asleep
>Kinda
>Blondie is out here too for some reason
>Fear crosses my face as i realize she either woke up listening
to the lewd things occurring in birthday girl's room or she was
moved here.

>Raven mentions glasses might have moved her
>I sure as fuck hope so.
>Blondie is sleeping peacefully but right across the entire
available walking space of the room.
>Cute face peeking out along with the top parts of her bunny PJs
>10/10 adorable right there.
>she's still blocking the way though, this is gonna be tough
>Seeing that the coast is clear we begin the long trek across the
living room
>floor is carpeted so we get +10 to sneak skill
>begin the trek across the living room
>We're both craftily dodging various articles of clothing and
food packages littered all over the floor.
>God damn ninjas over here
>*Clang*

>Raven hit a soda can with her foot
>Great dishonor upon raven's ninja famiry
>It echoes pretty loudly as it skitters off and ends with a thud
at the bottom of a table
>Submarine Mode Engaged, Breath held, Motionless.
>Nothing happens
>Nobody even moves
>Resurface and return to stealth mode
>Halfway across the room now
>Crossing in front of the couch, homely is laid down parallel to
the couch but with a decent pathway between the two.
>Trying to lead raven through the valley of sleeping girls
>still holding hands with her right behind me
>this hand holding is making it pretty hard to get through
without stepping on homely's sleeping bag
>Dont want to let go because this is fucking fun

>Halfway between couch and sleeping bag
>Look over towards sleeping birthday girl
>stomach and curve of one breast is showing
>no tits, just that delicious underboob
>i've obviously paused or something
>Raven notices me staring
>Jealousy
>I get my left butt cheek pinched pretty damn hard
>not hot at all
>that shit hurt
>i wasn't even staring that long you bitch
>Almost let out a yelp but i hold it in
>I'm not even mad but i might as well act the part
>Glare daggers back at her
>She's got a picture perfect mischievous smile on
>My gaze melts instantly and i can't help but stifle a giggle
>Mostly because she looks hilarious with her current getup
>Her finger instantly goes towards her mouth in a characteristic
"Hush" motion
>Sneak mode Resumed

>Finally almost past the couch
>Time for the final obstacle
>Mount blondie
>"Mount Blondie" is not a valid action at this time
>I... i meant she was like a mountain we had to climb over
b-baka!
>She's sprawled out across the entire floorspace with her head
near the couch and her feet over by the TV
>Trying to figure out where to cross the sleeping girl without
disturbing her
>decide that just taking a big step right over her head is
probably the best idea
>tentatively put my foot out and over her body
>Firmly set it on the other side
>Legs pretty spread at this point over her
>I'm wagglin in the wind.
>Oh man i hope to god she doesn't wake up right now
>The sight she would see
>Feels dirty man
>Slightly embarrassed at the thought, so i hurry up and finish
moving to the other side
>Raven's turn
>She takes the same step that i did, but this time with me
helping her by holding her arm up and supporting her.
>She's a little wobbly but gets a firm foot down.
>She's just as spread out as i was
>Please don't let blondie be awake
>Please don't let blondie be awake
>Of course, whichever god, alien race, or branch of the FBI that
was listening to those thoughts had to intervene
>We hear a loud snort
>fuck

>We freeze
>Please don't let it be blondie please don't let it be blondie
>Blondie's sleeping bag starts rustling
>Fuck oh fuck oh fuck
>Raven is still standing there with her crotch spread eagle right
above blondie's face
>I'm thinking this is some twilight zone level coincidental
bullshit
>but its not
>we both realize its not blondie's sleeping bag moving
>Homely's moving her feet and its rustling blondie's sleeping bag
>Fuckin hell
>Ends up homely gave off a snort or something in her sleep and
rolled over
>Honestly what do you expect at this point
>homely man, there's a reason nobody likes her

>After we nearly pissed ourselves in an extremely compromising
position, raven gets her other foot over
>Home stretch
>Carpet, no obstacles
>I got no clue where to go so raven takes the lead
>We hit a couple of dark passageways, a secret tunnel and go
through at least three revolving bookcases
>Really though it was a super dark.
>I think it was a hallway and a room or two, really i could
barely see
>Didn't stub my toes at all on things i couldn't see, Raven; best
nightvision goggles a man could ask for.
>its those green eyes, fuckin magic i swear
>We get to the parent's bedroom
>it's pretty dark
>flip on the light
>HUGE ASS BED

>They had a california King
>thats like the biggest bed you can get
>Raven and i exchange knowing glances
>Mentally planning lewd in the future
>She leads me across the room and around the gigantic bed towards
the door on the other side
>Since the lights are on, i get to stare at the subtle jiggle of
her tush as she walks.
>Dat Ass
>Not just Dat Ass, i get to intently examine the curves of her
back, the smooth lines where her shoulders meet and even the
curvature of her spine.
>Women's bodies are amazing
>As i'm staring at her curves and luscious everything we turn the
corner of the bed
>I stub my toe on the corner of the bedpost
>God damnit

>Half hopping on one foot and with raven giggling, we reach the
master bathroom.
>Turn on the light
>Its massive
>Tile floors
>Giant bathtub
>Huge walk in shower
>Marble counters
>Far as hell from the living room
>Probably soundproof if we close the door
>Raven releases my hand and pulls it away pretty quickly
>It sticks to my hand and there's a definite sensation of it
peeling away as she does it
>It feels awful, but the worst part is that she's no longer
holding my hand
>She rushes out of the bathroom
>Its almost soul crushing, i'm left there standing and
contemplating suicide or something
>pls come back raven ):
>I stand there kind of awkwardly for what's probably the worst 4
seconds of the night
>then raven's back
>She grabs both my hands and is holding them facing me now
>fingers intertwined again, hell yes
>"I closed the bedroom door"
>Fuckin brilliant i tell you this girl was


>Taking her hint, i back up into the bathroom door and use my
foot to close it softly
>Hands still intertwined we try to move over to the master shower
>This doesn't work very well
>we end up crab walking like idiots, and realizing someone needs
to turn on the nozzle and all that
>The shower has this fancy lever with hot and cold nicely
labeled, so i take the hint and extract a hand and start the
"Getting it hot but not too hot game"
>Raven's just smiling like a happy fool, im sure i was too
>Temperature is right and steam is slowly fogging up all the
reflective surfaces in the bathroom
>Sexy shower scene time
>Oh wait, no showers don't work like that
>More soul crushing i guess
>[spoiler]Now anons, if you've ever taken a shower with someone
else you realize a lot of things right off the bat[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]Firstly there's not nearly enough room for both of you
to be under the water. No matter what you try[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]One of you is going to get shafted on the being warm
part[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]Next up is the cleaning, in a shower you kinda have a
routine, soap, shampoo, whatever you rub down and clean[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]When there's two people suddenly all routine is out the
window and you're just rubbing down one another's privates
endlessly [/spoiler]
>[spoiler]I mean technically we needed that but don't point that
out i'm trying to remind you this is real life here : Sorry
Lonely Anons[/spoiler]

>Seeing as you now understand the predicament, we both were now
trying to get under the hot water
>Sadly the hand-holding was coming to an end about the second we
stepped into the shower as well.
>The water was washing away the stickiness and they just changed
to slippery and smooth real quick.
>That's alright too, slippery hands are great and can go all
kinds of places
>My hands being slippery and wet now, got to wrapping themselves
around her back and squeezing raven as close as i could possibly
get to me.
>Because she's pretty much flat chest masterrace, the "When you
hug a flat chested girl you hold her closer to your heart" was
pretty damn true in this case
>All i could hear and feel was the hot shower water and her heart
beating against my chest
>I was probably suffocating her a little bit too but i'm sure she
didn't mind at the time.
>We hold that position for a while, heads over one another's
shoulder, hug probably as tight as could be
>My thoughts drift to her breasts and how her nipples are digging
into my chest
>Boner at half mast, arise from the dead initiated.
>Obviously nestles between her legs pointing downwards along the
seam of her thighs
>This is the best place for it

>My mind isn't thinking a single thing besides how comfy this is
right now
>Hot shower
>My best friend (who happens to be female)
>happy place for penis to recover from blowjob
>Pretty definitely one of my favorite moments for sure.
>Sadly the favorite moment had to come to an end eventually
>we got to the nitty gritty process of washing one another
>Which was less nitty gritty and more my hands everywhere i could
put them
>First i had to clean her breasts
>I grabbed the nearest soap (some of that doctor brom's
peppermint stuff)
>If you dont know what im talking about you're probably not a
human
>[spoiler] its like soap and peppermint oil, fucking smells
amazing and it does "Other things" i'll explain in a second,
everyone else knows what im talking about but : YW Non-Human
Anons [/spoiler]
>If you know what im talking about you know this was a terrible
idea

>So of course, both hands move to her breasts, i put her under
the water and the "cleaning commences"
>First the left breast, lathered up
>Then the right breast, lathered as well
>Then the entire area around them
>Shoulders, arms, stomach
>Back to the breasts
>Back to the stomach again
>Back to the breasts
>I mentally say fuck it and proceed to just play with her breasts
for another couple minutes
>She doesn't stop me so you know whatever i figure they need to
be clean right?
>She's not even commenting or pushing me away
>This is actually kinda weird for her

>Force my gaze away from her breasts
>Look at her face
>She's got it completely scrunched up, looks like she's got
trouble concentrating or even standing
>Oh shit she's got really sensitive breasts
>Drop my hands from them (regret it instantly)
>She instantly returns to the land of the living and has a blush
creeping into her cheeks
>It creeps just about everywhere else
>full body blush on a light skinned girl is amazing i tell you,
you can watch it spread.
>She doesn't say anything though, so i return my hands to soaping
her up
>Arms
>Thighs
>Legs
>To get her legs i had to kneel down
>Perfect face to crotch level
>Of course all i can see is a big mat of wet pubes, but it was
the first chance i'd had a good well-lit look at her crotch.
>Actually any of the girl's crotches for that matter
>Whatever it was, my male brain told me that it was perfect and i
should worship it
>The mind is always willing

>Only half a boner still, i guess the body is weak
>I rise back up and start with the breasts again
>can you really blame me?
>Raven is back in another land, eyes nearly rolling out of her
head.
>Just some girls are like that, you touch the tits and they fall
apart in your hands, others can't feel a thing.
>[spoiler]Its definitely a fact that smaller breasts are way more
sensitive[/spoiler]
>Back to her breasts, i've got my hands tweaking her nipples now
>Its not like the tactile sensation of nipples is great or
anything, they're just really fun to play with
>Raven is back against the tile of the shower now and i'm the one
in the hot water
>She's making about a thousand different faces a second
>I'm thinking i must be amazing, some kind of crazy pleasure
artist
>Absolute master at pleasing women
>Should sell my skills

>In my megalomania inspired tit-play
>I ignore the fact that raven now has goosebumps again
>She's shivering (probably with how good i was)
>She blurts out two words "i'm c-cold!"
>Fuck
>Peppermint oil
>The second you get out of hot water its like toothpaste or
spearmint gum and drinking water afterwards
>that shit is freezing for no good reason
>that's why she was making faces
>put her back in the hot stream of shower water
>problem temporarily solved
>but breast induced orgasm chances ruined
>My young mind was pretty disappointed, i could swear i had read
it was possible somewhere.
>Not to be dissuaded i start again
>Raven's not having any of that, pushes my hands away and tells
me to finish up properly.

>I take the time to soap up the rest of her front
>work some soap into her pubes as well
>until it looks like she's bleached them into a frothy white mess
>Bleached pubes should be a fetish
>Ignoring the obvious thing she wants me to do
>Or i think she wants me to do
>I flip her around
>i start soaping up her shoulders
>Lather the hell out of her back
>God its so much fun to play with a girl's soapy back, so many
creases and ravines to get lost in
>So many bumps to feel and patterns to trace
>What can i say, i take joy out of the most silly things when i'm
with women.
>I soap up her lower back and butt next, then skip down to her
thighs and lower legs
>Same deal as with the front, i get to pretty much put my face
inches away from her ass
>Giant globes (when you're that close) of delicious soft flesh
>Cop-a-feel-initiated


>Obviously playing with the butt is just as fun as the breasts,
but lots different
>You get to press the cheeks together until there's just a seam
in the middle
>You get to pull it apart and see the inner prizes within
>Since raven had a small but cute round set of buttocks, my hands
and mind were in a happy place.
>After playing with it for a minute, i get an idea after pulling
her cheeks apart
>I stand up fully, bring my hand down and rest it on her lower
spine, making sure it's nice and sudsy from the peppermint
>with my other hand i wrap it around her waist/stomach and pull
her close to me
>Slide my hand down until its resting in the crease of her
asscrack
>Slide it lower
>Begin fondling/soaping up the entire length of her most intimate
places
>Im not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing,
>but she's squirming
>Probably good
>After a bit more of this smooth soaping, i take my middle finger
and try to stick it in her soapy pussy
>I say try
>I miss

>I use too much pressure in the wrong place
>Middle finger right in the ass
>I'd love to tell you she moaned, or bent over and asked for
more, or did anything even remotely hentai/porno/h-manga ish.
>She didn't
>She squealed "Eeeek"
>My hand was quickly extracted
>I mumble a couple apologies and make excuses about it being
soapy
>She's not really mad or angry, just not alright with that kind
of thing at the moment
>Makes sense, a finger in my butt would probably go over just as
well with me.
>Oh well, a vagina is fine too
>facing her front now, hand snakes down to her pubic mound
>Starts rubbing
>Her hands are on mine in an instant
>Holding them still

>Oh nope
>One word from her mouth "Sore"
>Well that was probably to be expected
>this girl had gotten off atleast five times that i knew of
tonight, and i was right there with her
>and i would bitch about how badly my balls hurt,
>but you know i kinda liked it.
>She decides its my turn to get washed

>She doesn't start with the penis
>Hopes and dreams crushed, perfect girl no more

>Mind assessing possible avenues of escape
>this isn't ok
>I know what's coming

>12/10 no finger in butt
>That did it
>Better than perfect
>My penis is now hard as a rock
>Welcome back old friend

>The kiss is pretty awesome, but Glasses girl has her beat on the
lung technique
>She tastes pretty sweet though, so its confirmed that 2/3 holes
are delicious
>Glasses girl was more tart in almost a dirty lusty sort of way
>Raven is just all sweet
>Raven breaks the kiss and goes back to the soaping endeavor
>She's shivering again
>That god damn soap man
>Fucking freezing i swear
>Water also isn't super hot anymore
>Pretty warm though, we still have time.
>Her hands feel amazing
>Seriously she's got them everywhere
>They rub my chest, my shoulders, arms, thighs, back
>God damn best feeling ever
>girl hands are best hands

>She's alternating between goosebumps and shivering though
>That soap
>Perfect excuse to frequently stop her and pull her close under
the shower
>Eventually we just give up on soaping
>and she just cuddles me close under the quickly cooling hot
water
>Its pretty warm still
>it might just be the peppermint soap making us cold
>We're definitely cuddling though
>Showers are awesome

>Her other hand gets the peppermint soap

against your stomach, then press a pillow down on top of it and
hold it firmly against your own stomach[/spoiler]

friction, specially if you can catch the head of your penis on
her bellybutton[/spoiler]

>And she would take her soapy hand and slip it between our bodies
and just fondle the top of it

>[Spoiler]but i'm pretty sure most anons here know that if they
soap up and play with only the head of their penis its a REALLY
unbearable feeling[/Spoiler]

stop because you can't take it.[/Spoiler]

feeling[/spoiler]

master shower area (its pretty big).
>I'm still laughing, but i've atleast got control of my motor
skills
>i manage to grab her wrist and hold on tightly
>Unwanted physical contact at this point
>She's squirming
>She's definitely crying
>Real amounts of hurt in her voice as she's probably concocted
some evil world where i'm laughing at her because she's unshaven
or something.
>Or something "Looks" funny
>Did i mention crippling self esteem issues does that to people.
>She's protesting with various sounds, and
>i just try to keep her from leaving.

almost sobbing "Let Go!"

(Imagine a 10 minute delay between posts here)






>with a kiss
>im sorry anons, i know i just wrenched your hearts to a million
little pieces and back again
>But thats my job
>I keep it going until my lungs hurt
>she's wide eyed staring directly into mine
>look of fear on her face.
>or maybe its confusion
>or just a girl who's had her heart broken and put back together
and broken again.
>I'm still stifling giggles into her mouth
>my penis is back up against her leg now and its not helping
>seriously stop it boner
>I keep the kiss going for what feels like forever
>Every time i giggle air kind of puffs out her cheeks and air
escapes between the gap of where our mouths meet
>its not helping because thats kinda funny in its own way


>really am kissing her for a long time
>It probably is forever because my lungs are burning
>I'm actually holding it long enough that i feel like passing out
>Giggles are slightly under control now
>Lack of air and pain definitely helping
>still giggling
>she's crying
>this is probably rape
>wait a second if i can't breathe then how is she breathing
>this is probably rape and murder
>She seems alert and not suffocated though, probably just rape
>Either way i'm dying for air so i drop the kiss
>I was actually seeing black dots in my vision
>practically gasping like i ran a mile
>just holding her up against the tile wall, my body against hers
>my head pressed over her shoulder.
>my forehead pressed onto the cool tile of the shower wall as i
gasp for breath.

>the lines of the tiles are swimming infront of my eyes, just
shimmering.
>I don't know what kinds of faces she's making
>But i had just forced a thousand emotions upon her with my lips.
>she is gasping for breath, i guess i was a little harsh
>I'm not laughing anymore
>still can't talk because i need that oxygen stuff that keeps me
from dying.
>Tiles are still a mixture of black dots, spinning and
shimmering.
>start gasping out words
>i'm right next to her ear so i know she can hear me loud and
clear.
>"You"
>About three seconds of heavy breathing
>"Made"
>Another three seconds
>"Itsensitive" (was all one word at the time)
>Probably four or five more seconds before i realize i need to
clarify
>"Ticklish"

>She's silent for pretty much no time at all before she makes a
sound
>It sounds like something halfway between a sound a seal and a
mouse would make.
>I dont know what i meant, but it sounded like a good sound
>Like a relieved sound
>i really don't know how to describe it, but it was a happy
not-humany sound
>girls make those sometimes
>I take it as a "you're out of shit creek anon" sound
>atleast i hope that's what it was
>still suppressing giggles
>probably still up shit creek without a paddle
>or a boat
>We're just like that for a little bit before we realize we're
both still covered in suds
>And its freezing
>Peppermint soooaaaapppp
>Back in the water we go

>water is definitely not hot anymore
>warm at best, transitioning to lukewarm
>End up both huddled shivering under the showerhead
>not warm enough to stop us from being peppermint cold if we take
turns
>Its so damn cold!
>Soap was a bad choice
>End up in the position that started the laughing again
>Head of penis isn't as sensitive anymore
>can safely nestle it up against her.
>happy place
>she spreads her legs a tiny bit
>penis goes between the thighs
>what is this magical sensation
>her crotch is like a degree or two hotter than her thighs
>Her thighs are rubbing me from either side
>She's wet and slippery from all the soap
>This is fucking amazing

Raven is up against me again, head on my shoulder.
>i get a whisper in my ear
>"The soap is tingly"
>"Its driving me crazy"
>I stifle another giggle
>Holyshitwhatswrongwithme
>Atleast she doesn't look hurt anymore, but she might have her
doubts
>Still though this is like a triple contact job or something
>Can you even get more body parts covering your penis at the same
time, i don't think so.
>I start gently thrusting, just back and forth.
>She's putty in my hands now, every time i pull back the ridge on
the head of my penis rubs along her ass
>And the bottom half of her sex
>and drags a generally great amount of friction across her outer
lips.
>for me its like the earlier stomach job + the friction of her
vagina
>Plus the hairs have this coarse texture to them as they rub
across all my other body parts
>i can't imagine what it feels like to her but im sure its great


>Suddenly
>She squeezes her thighs together tightly
>God damn pressure on my dick so good
>Holy hell i'm going to die right here and now
>I'm done with subtlety, its quicktime event button mashing time.
>Press X to Thrust
>Press X to Thrust
>Press Y to pull girl towards you
>We're both spamming quicktime button events like crazy
>Breathing like god damn lunatics, ragged breaths everywhere
>Her pubic hair is tickling my balls
>[spoiler] This is a fucking amazing sensation[/spoiler]
>I've got probably a third of a minute before i explode
>Raven has her hands on my butt again, pulling me closer each
thrust
>Each time my pelvic bone is actually grinding against hers
>Holyshitholyshitholyshit

>No words to describe
>Getting close
>Raven pulls me close one last time, one hand firmly grasping my
butt
> nearly tearing into it with how hard she's holding it.
>Hurts so good
>Her other hand slides down my buttcrack
>OH NO
>TOO CLOSE TO STOP
>I get a single soapy index finger in my butt
>Blow my god damn load right then and there
>All over her thighs and ass
>All over the tile wall behind her too
>Weak kneed is an understatement, that was probably up in my top
ten of orgasms at that point in life.
>Atleast top four, or five.
>I don't know if raven came or not
>I'm definitely too worn out know or notice
>She's got a smile on though i guess it was good enough for her.
>Then her smile turns to a frown.

>The water is not warm anymore
>its actually pretty cold
>fucking freezing actually
>We get as far away from it as possible and she actually laughs
>Its a happy sound
>Its a good sound to hear since minutes earlier she was letting
out some of the saddest sounds i'd ever heard her make.
>We turn off the shower and exit the room holding hands again
>But it's fucking freezing
>SOAAAPPPP
>So we drop hands and grab towels and start drying ourselves off
>And yeah a bit of one another
>Mostly her hair, it was super wet and hair takes forever to
fluff dry
>Dry and still freezing
>SOOAAAAPP

>this soap really does chill you to the bone for like 15 minutes
after the shower
>My balls were freezing because that was where the most soap was
last
>I'm sure her privates were cold enough to make her a frost witch
>God damnit
>so cold
>She's complaining too
>god damn freezing
>this fucking soap man
>We're both completely dry now
>shivering
>god damnit
>huddling together for warmth won't work
>we figure we might as well start on back to the birthdaygirl
room because its freezing and we need clothes
>slip out of bathroom holding hands again but freezing cold this
time
>lights are off in parent's room
>what

>fumble around in parent's room for lightswitch
>turn it on
>Our clothes are neatly folded and sitting in the middle of
parents bed
>spooky.jpeg
>we both figure we might as well get dressed
>i get my shirt on, and then reach for my underwear
>none

>clothing accomplished, we check the time
>6:15
>Toofuckinearly

>We contemplate sneaking back to birthday girl's room
>But its too much of a hassle, and we have a hueege bed right
here
>dont even have to say anything to one another
>Raven just crawls all the way up the bed (its huge) and lies her
head down on a pillow
>Of course she pats the spot right next to her
>putmeinchiefigotthis
>i fly through the air and land in the exact spot she wanted me,
>[spoiler]and by that i mean i crawl over because i'm
tired[/spoiler]
>she drapes one of her arms over me, and then slides the other
under the pillow i lie my head down on
>fuckin magic tricks
>god damn perfect arm positioning
>i do the same thing to her and find my arm isnt going numb
>she's brilliant i tell you
>i probably mumble something along those lines too
>but we're out like snug bugs in a rug
>last thing i remember is her head nuzzled against my chest
>and how much that was probably uncomfortable because my chest is
not a soft thing.
