so eager beaver.
	Look, no rashn not bop.  All do, no harm.  But me?  One 
part ya, one part no. Een ok, ya, but no luv.  Cute but low 
ceiling, yno?  And no luv me, no matter mouth.  He just like my 
nobs and fan, my style, my rank.  Trophy girl, yno?  He just want 
brag rights.
	I in Kitten Klan, top girls 9 Form.  Zee, the prez, she no 
prudy trudy.  Most Kittens bop, too, they paired.  Some bop from 
6 Form.  Me, want more than bangdy-bop and bye.  Not truluv, yno, 
but not just caus.
	So I let Een feelie but no bop.
	Ex-boy Jona I maybe luv some, I think.  Two year twosome.  
End of my 8 form (9 him), he go way for summer, so before, we 
bop.  Big send-off.
	Everybod say small pain, then fun, so I brave.  Not so.  
Jona big shit.  Talk big, know zero, hurt plenty.  I say ya, he 
roll me, spread me, push it in.  I not ready.  Make me cry, big 
turd.  No fun.  In-out, in-out, sploom.  He, big grin.  Me, pist.  
Have good time, Jona-shit.  Have good life, Jona-shit.  Byebye, 
Jona-shit.  Rase me perment, please.
	Not since.
	I get new gy quick. Een dance good, look good, joke good, 
get family car weekends.  Handy candy.  Short term gy, tho, I 
think pretty quick.

Today, 1 period chem class, new boy name Riis.  Double plus 
cute, new in town.  Girls drool him awful.  He smile and chat 
all, but eyes for me.  Say hi after class, I go hi back, we talk 
some.  Where he from (Montreal), why (new job for Da), form (10), 
pairgal (no).  I say got gy, Een.  Riis say oh.
	Lunch, he see me and Een, smile, stop, shake hands.  Class 
act gy.  Study hall, no Een there.  Riis and me pass notes.  Good 
write, not like Een scrib can diddly read.  Write funny, make me 
giggle.  Draw pic of montor.  Bad!  Draw pic of me.  Flattry!
	He eyelook me makes thighs quiver, knees weak.  He see ME, 
not just ogle bod.  Riis talk face not tits.  More he not look, 
more I wish him.  Look me I say with moves.  He shake head and 
smile.  He look me then ok plenty, then talk me again.  He cool.  
I wet.
	Surprise.  I not feel that since Jona-shit.  This gy, just 
know now, already ready-eddy.  Shame I say me.  Shame or not I 
say back, still.  Duh.
	That night, I rase Een.  My house, Ma-Pa working natch, we 
play old touchie-feelie games. Een go, come on, Satin, time we 
do. I say no, he still pushy-tushy.  He push me too hard, yno?  I 
say too much.  I say so long shitbird.  I say go find some gal 
roll over easy.  Not me.  Not you.
	Een little hurt but no beg.  He go too bad so sad and walk 
out.  Not soso sad, really, I think maybe, yno.  Think maybe he 
already figure he not gonna get it.
He leave, I cry little, my room.  Then I think of Riis.  
	Like magic, he call.
	My call-ID got from Sami, Kitten Klan too.  Sami gy and 
Riis quick friends.  He ask, she tell. (Buy Sami soda.)  Later 
she tattle me he ask too if me-Een longtime?  She go no.  She go, 
maybe not so solid, Een-me.
	We talk.  Why home, not out party, Riis go.  School I say 
back.  What, he say, not believe me.  Hears me good, knows 
something up.  What?  I cry, Een-me done.  We rase it.  Oh too 
bad, he say.  So sincere, Riis, almost believe he only care me 
feel bad.  Almost.
	Next day, Een and me go round on the tongue.  Heads up, 
though.  No shame neither. No big surprise I find.  Nobody think 
we valentine couple.  Surprise me learn it.  Gys start to circle, 
scope me, all eager eyeballs now.  I see girls around Een.  We 
don't talk.  Good luck to him.  
	Lunch with Kittens.  Eyes hungry for Riis.  Only quick word 
so far  hi, you okay?  Like that.  He stayaway?  What for?  Road 
open, light green, Riis.  Drive this way.  Kittens talk much, 
duh.  But cheer me up.  Putdown Een, kid me -- better off in 
turkey free zone, Zee go.  I act little sad, smile brave.  Head 
up, yno?  (See better that way.)
	All day, I no talk Riis, cept how-do.  Study hall, he come 
late, no seat near me.  Catch eyes cross room, time to time.  
Smiles.  I melt, hope no show.
	
	But today I first kiss Riis.  Like this. 
	School over we meet by sportfield, just happen.  Well, 
maybe we look each, ya.  Mucho chit-chat, first.  Time pass, talk 
this that, say mostly nothing.  I wait for move, shy me.  We wall 
lean, side-side, talk school.  Different here Riis say.  Miss old 
school, old friends.  Riis say he wanted stay, finish year.  
Smiles.  Now, maybe not so bad after all.
	He go too bad Een, I go not so, goodby good, hello better.  
Riis smile me.  Hand touch my hair, gentle.  I press head to 
palm, he stroke.  Riis lean down, I lift head.  Warm lips touch.  
Almost drop books.
	Never feel this, really no really.  With Jona-shit, 
sometime I sigh for luv.  With Riis, heart pound, belly flutter, 
feel faint.  So sudden.  Two days back, no idea this.  Now all is 
Riis-Riis-Riis.  Truluv?  Not know.  More luv than ever before, 
ya.  I no care if truluv.  Riis.  RIIS!
	He walk me home.  Thru town, we hand hold.  Closed store, 
doorway, Riis pull me in, wrap arms around, deep kiss. I drop 
books this time and grab back.  Kiss him good.  Nobs to chest, 
pressing, tongue probes, leg between mine, rub all over.  Not 
possible enough.  Giddy-giddy walk home.  No doorway now.  
Touchie all time, my arm waist, he my shoulder.  He lean tree and 
pull me to.  Tongue lick my heart, my soul.
	So horny I can't believe.  Total open.  Hold him, hug him, 
kiss him, arm wrap, push against.  Pull so hard he merge me.  All 
his.
	Riis ask me out Saturday night.  
	Rest of week like foggy dream.  School I see Riis, class I 
see Riis or don't see Riis, lunch I eat and drink Riis, after 
school I with Riis, night I dream Riis.  
	Dinnertime, Ma-Da go you okay?  Ya, I say, big test coming.  
Maybe so, but not school test.  Ma look me, smile.  She cool.  
She girlie too.
	Saturday coming, and I already know.  Riis want, he got.  
No, I want.  He don't need ask.  Only need time.  Only need 
place.  Nighttime, I touch me, dream him.  Hand touch tits, his 
hand, squeeze gentle, stroke nip, squeeze harder.  Whisper ya.  
Ya, Riis.  Other hand slide down, stroke me.  Oh, Riis.  Touch 
me.  Ya, baby, oh ya, sweet baby.

	Finally Saturday.  Morning, Ma-me go shopping, other shit.  
Afternoon, I wash hair, lay out clothes, take bath, put on 
clothes, take off clothes, put on other clothes, take off, put 
on, take off, put on.  Good thing Riis finally come pick me up.  
Still be changing clothes.
	See movie -- don't ask, don't know.  Riis have car - own 
car, not ma-das.  After show, we drive.  Where, Riis ask.  
Anywhere, I go.  Little while I say, no, someplace quiet, just 
you-me.  Riis new, no idea.  I show.  Out Venture Road, up Lolly 
Canyon.
	In pullout, sit there, lights below.  Some reason, we both 
shy now.  Wait-wait-wait, now allasudden here.  Finely he put arm 
my shoulder.  I snuggle up, head on shoulder.
Riis sigh, say so beautiful.  View, I go?  You.  Turn me, 
eyes deep.  Heart start to pound again.  Eye 2 eye.  Then Riis 
look my mouth.  Want to kiss me, ya, I know.  Lick my lips, let 
part.  He pull me to, slowly put his to mine.  Touch light, 
feather tip of tongue tracing.  Can't breathe.  More.
	Gentle, slow, but strong Riis press my lips.  Tongue reach, 
probe me, mine answers.  O Riis!  Breath is sudden gaspy.  Kiss 
me, Riis.  O ya.
	Arms both pull me tight.  Nobs press his chest, homey.  
Warm all through me.  Middle, my core, my puss, squeeze and lax, 
squeeze and lax.  Ya Riis, silent say, tonight ya.
	Hand my side, slide up, cup titty.  I press me into palm.  
Take Riis, I give you.  Hand tighten, ease, stroke.  Nip is 
pebble hard, feel through bra, ya.  He stroke and squeeze me.  
Tingle all.  Kiss again and again.
	Riis drop hand, find bottom of sweater.  More tingle, 
knowing next.  Tickle touch of fingers on ribs as his hand up 
under to find me again.  Cup me again, thumb brush top of bare 
nob, skin to skin.  My middle wetting.  Ya Riis.
	Riis move lips to my throat, below ear, kiss light, then 
down to base.  Suck kiss there send bolt through me.  Thumb into 
bra, pull down and slide under.  Tit free.  Hand under sweater 
move up, slide strap down onto arm, then back.  Fingers find 
nipple, brush it light.
	I move hand to Riis shirt, open top button, then next, then 
next.  Slide into shirt, across chest, hair trace in middle wiry 
against soft of palm.  Press my warm hand against chest.
	Riis kiss my lips again, deep kiss.  Open to him, inviting.  
Tongue deep, warm, wet, moving.  Can't breathe, I feel.
	I push against Riis chest.  Wait, I go, pull back.  Arms 
cross and pull sweater over my head.  Right tit out, seem silly.  
Reach behind and open back.  Slide bra off, drop on top of 
sweater.
	Riis hug me close, make me shiver.  Cold, scared, hot?  
Little bit, Riis push me back, look between.
	Eyes like hot steel, hungry eyes.  Nobs swell, nips taut.  
Ya beautiful, Riis say.  Kisses down my chest, tit all over, lick 
nip.  Warm all over, me.  Feel like this never, not Een, not 
Jona-shit.  Want it.  Lips, hand on tits, hot flashes through me.  
Titbone connected to pussybone.
	Slide my hand down him, so bold me.  Can't say it, fingers 
speak.  Touch there, hard beneath soft cotton.  Riis hiss in, 
push against my hand.  Groan.
	O Satin, say Riis, you make me crazy.  Don't tease, please, 
he say, better quit now.  No tease I say.  No tease.  He look me 
in eyes.  Say ya with my eyes.  Say no tease, mean no tease.
	Riis slide hand to my middle quick.  On thigh, then in, 
find center warmth.  Groan now my turn.  Tongue to ear, teeth to 
lobe.  Move my leg to give him room, push back against his stoke.  
No words enough.
	More deep kisses, both hands busy.  Quivers through me, 
over-over.  Quiver each, less breath, more want.  I unbutton all 
Riis shirt, pull to my breast.  Nips to chest, poke him, send 
more flashes.  Can feel wet.  Slide back on seat, Riis half over, 
chest to my chest.
	Riis fingers fumble my middle, find button, find zip.  
Slide down feel my soul open, spring free.  Push down sides, give 
him room.  Hand warm on belly, then lower, find my pussy hair.  
Lower.  Between thighs, cup over me.
	Magic time.  Riis touch me there, my flower open to him.  
Finger slide between, touch button.  Shudder through me.  Press 
in, and me knees wider, wanting.  Slide in my juice, in, out, 
back in, deeper.  I push back, want or no.  Middle own me, run 
me.  It want.  Finger probes deeper, all way in.
	So hungry me.  Against Riis, bare nob to bare chest.  Lips 
go down my neck, nibble and suck, onto chest.  My tit Riis suck 
all, take nip between warm lips, tongue tease.  Hand at my 
middle, finger deep all inside, thumb stoke button.  Squeeze hand 
between my thighs, shudder, shift up and back, self do me.
	Reach for him, fumble belt and button and zip.  At last, 
slide fingers in.  Touch velvet steel, my palm damp.  Holding in 
my hand, up and down, squeeze fingers around, tight like I be.  
Puss hand.  Riis groan, deep and low.  Mouth to my ear, breath 
ragged, quivered.  Push him through sliding fingers.  Teeth to my 
throat, nip, bite, suck.  His leg between mine, slide up behind 
hand, press into me.  Oh, oh, oh.  Kiss souls, passion rising.
	Hand grip, Riis quiver.  My palm moist, he slide in my 
fingers, little back, little forth.  Hand more, all over.  Touch 
balls light, feathery, slide up, grip strong, cup head.  Hand 
wrap over top of him, push into grip.  Spread hand, Riis.  Spread 
me, too.
	Steel flesh.  It shudder me to think it come inside.  I 
think no Jona, no fear.  Wet, wetter, want this so.  Yearn me to 
be around him.  Take, spread me.  Fill my hole with his pole.
	I gingerly stroke, he moan.  Bolder, wrap in palm and rub.  
More moan.  Lips at my neck, suck nibble nibble suck.  Finger 
deep and urgent.  Urgent me, too.
	Riis move hand away suddenly, my heart cry at loss.  But he 
pushing shorts down legs.  I help, waggle-wiggle, kick off.  Open 
my legs, give him me.  He touch again, probe again.  Riis move up 
beside me, kissing, pushing own pants down.  Hold him, stroke 
him, pull him.
	He move between my legs, up and over me.  I spread to him, 
wide open.  My hand guiding, pulling.  Down at me Riis move, 
blunt tip probes my belly, hair, oh.  Oh!
	Wet for him, slide in my lips, my hand push him down, lift 
me up to meet.  It goes in.  Pain, no pain, spreading me, inward 
goes.  Can't breathe.  Slide deeper, back, deeper again.  Eyes 
tight, feel him in me pushing, in, back, more in.  So good.
	Riis all the way in.  My hands on his butt pulling him to 
me, me to him. Riis arms fold and chest come down to press on me, 
heavy delicious weight, push down and press in.  All the way, 
Riis, all, more, all. Riis push arm behind my neck, pull me up 
against.  Oh delicious god oh so good.
	Riis stroke me slow.  Back some, back in, back more, almost 
out I fear, then oh so god delicious slow in me sliding til root 
in me buried in my belly, my soul.  Out and in go Riis.
	My own voice in my ears gasp and whine.  O god, say, o god 
Riis.  So good.  Fuck me Riis, say.  Never word said to guy like 
this.  But fuck me Riis, say.  So good, baby, do me.  Oh god ya.
	Riis face seem like pain, but know not so.  I move to him.  
Lift to him, push to him, bury him in me.  My hips alive, twist 
and push and pull away, turn on him, work him in me.  He groan, 
drive him deep in me, slap flesh to flesh, withdraw, force down 
again in me.
	Stupid, I think.  Stupid Jona-shit.  Give him this and no 
idea.  Now Riis get it all.  Oh god Riis.
	Riis push deep and high, rub me in special place.  Send 
sparks through my body, rubberband stretched and twanged, send 
quivers.  Have touched me myself, ya, have come with my fingers, 
but this, oh this!  My heart pounding, spirit rising, barely 
here.  I don't see, don't think.  Smell, ya, Riis in my nose, 
breathe his musk into my heart.  Touch ya, feel ya, Riis hard 
chest to my soft, my nips hard as little candies, Riis pole slide 
into my soul, dig me, drill me, pull back and pumps out my soul 
breath.
	God, Riis say.  God, Satin, oh so good.  Oh sweet, oh love.  
Oh fuck me, Satin baby.  Give it to me, ya.  Ya.
	He tremble and tremble me.  Can't stop, build more and 
more.  My arms clutch and pull around Riis neck.  Kisses too deep 
to believe.  Riis tongue lick my soul.
	Oh god, baby, Riis say.  Gonna do it.  Oh, god, Satin 
honey.  Ya, baby, do me, do me, do me.  He do me, I do all I can.  
Push and pull and jerk away and push back again.  Wanting it, 
dying when he go away, crying when he go in, again, again, hard 
again.
	Riis cry and push deep, jerking, coming, spitting come in 
me.  And me, oh me, coming too.  Can't believe, so good.  No 
control, me, jerking and twitching and quivering on pole so deep 
inside me.  God oh ya Riis, come baby.  Me too baby.  Ya!

	Lifetime later, I lie in Riis arms.  Now done, I happy, 
proud, scared.  Tomorrow, don't know.  We go on, see what happen.  
Still, big change.  Touchie-feelie, ya, but bop plenty too.

End of 'Bop' by Titmouse.  
Story 31

Author's Note:

This story has hung around in my notes for some time, under the 
temporary name 'Experimental.'  One day I was noodling at the 
keyboard when this phrase came out of nowhere.  'We touchie-
feelie but we no bop.'

I've experimented with alternate prose forms since high school, 
and the first short story I ever finished was a stream-of-
consciousness bit.  Language is constantly evolving, especially 
teen slang.  So I thought I would tell a story from the 
indefinite future in an evolved argot.

I won't blame you if you don't like it or don't find it 
especially sexy.  But I'd be interested in what you do find it.
