    Georgia'>August 30, 2000<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>The van dropped the Williams family off at their front door a
    little after <br>
    midnight. After they'd moved all their bags into the foyer the driver left.
    <br>
    Narisa slowly walked into the main foyer with her head twisting every <br>
    which way in wide-eyed wonder at her new home. She was totally <br>
    mesmerized by the sheer size and, what she considered opulence of her <br>
    new home, an opulence in size and comfort that Americans seem to <br>
    ungratefully assume as normal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>After an audible gasp, Narisa thought to herself as she took in
    what she <br>
    perceived to be a mansion. <i>Wow! I knew people lived like this, but I
    never <br>
    would have thought that <b>I</b> would! Just look at this place: the
    kitchen looks <br>
    as big as a small apartment!<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Judging from the look on Narisa's face, Josh thought he knew what
    she was <br>
    thinking and chuckled because he never really thought much about where <br>
    and how his family lived, thinking they were just average folks. They <br>
    weren't poor, but they weren't rich either. Josh's new house, to him, was <br>
    just an average four-bedroom home with three-and-a-half baths and had a <br>
    decent-sized yard. Narisa was enthralled with the place and insisted he
    give <br>
    her a tour. He showed her the kitchen and breakfast area, the formal living
    <br>
    and dining rooms and the library that his parents used as their office. One
    <br>
    bedroom was set up as a guest room; the other that shared a buddy bath <br>
    with Josh's bedroom was going to be his play space. Although not set up <br>
    yet, he was going to put a large TV with his video station hooked up, some <br>
    chairs and a desk with his computer for studying. He showed her his <br>
    parents' master suite then headed downstairs to grab their bags.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Taking their luggage to their room, Josh told Narisa that this was
    their <br>
    &quot;bridal suite&quot;. She giggled and flopped on the bed. She kicked
    off her shoes <br>
    and wiggled her sock-covered toes at him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Lick me, husband. Lick stinky toes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>He playfully grabbed her feet and pulled her socks off with his
    teeth and <br>
    began her tickle torture. She laughed, squirmed and twisted but she loved <br>
    it. Out of breath, Josh kissed her tiny feet and pulling her to her feet <br>
    motioning for her to follow. They headed back downstairs with his parents. <br>
    There wasn't anything to eat, but they sat at the breakfast bar drinking <br>
    bottled water and discussed what they'd do the coming weekend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Marie, Josh's mom, said that the first thing they were going to do
    the next <br>
    morning after getting some breakfast was to go grocery shopping. After <br>
    they'd taken care of restocking the pantry and fridge, she said that <br>
    depending on what time they finished, maybe they'd ride over to Tyson's <br>
    Corner and do some school shopping at the mall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Monday morning, the entire family would have to go the teen's high
    school, <br>
    register Narisa and see if would be possible to get her and Josh's
    schedules <br>
    somewhat synchronized to better help Narisa get acclimated. Both Marie <br>
    and Steve, Josh's dad, explained to Narisa that in addition to her studies,
    <br>
    she'd have to attend ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) <br>
    classes to learn English a couple of nights each week. Between Josh and his
    <br>
    parents, they'd help Narisa with her studies and homework. On Tuesday <br>
    morning at ten, they had an appointment at the courthouse for a <br>
    conference with Judge Henry Stiles of the Fairfax County Family Court in <br>
    his chambers to discuss Narisa and Josh's marriage and whether or not it <br>
    would be necessary to marry again. As a result, the teens would miss the <br>
    first two days of classes: class-work and homework they'd probably have to <br>
    make up. Josh thought to himself, <i>Jeez! Already starting off in the
    hole!<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa, although trying to put up a nonchalant front thought to
    herself, <br>
    <i>How will I ever do this! How will I ever be able to learn anything when
    I <br>
    can't understand what's being taught? My gosh! I won't even be able to <br>
    read the textbooks!<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Wednesday, Steve and Marie would return to work and the teens
    would be <br>
    on the school bus and off to school to begin what would become their daily <br>
    routines. Marie also said she was going to call their new family physician <br>
    and get Josh an appointment to get his cracked ribs checked. Narisa and <br>
    Josh didn't really have much to say except to go with the flow. It seemed <br>
    that the adults had the whole thing worked out and the teens were just <br>
    following orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh and Narisa said goodnight to Josh's parents and headed
    upstairs. <br>
    Narisa fished out her shower cap from her suitcase and they took a quick <br>
    shower. Then hopping into bed nude, they snuggled up for their first night <br>
    in their new home. Although tired, both had a little trouble getting to
    sleep, <br>
    probably because of the flight, excitement of the press conference and <br>
    Narisa's new home environment, but after some reassuring cuddles and <br>
    kisses, Josh's pretty little pixie spooned up against him and they settled
    off <br>
    to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh awoke the next morning to the shower running and feeling a
    little <br>
    frisky, hopped out of bed to join his unsuspecting wife. Narisa
    &quot;Eeek'ed&quot; <br>
    out in surprise when he slid in behind her and she giggled once her initial
    <br>
    shock had passed. He fingered her to quick, although knee-weakening <br>
    orgasm then washed her hair. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Mmm. Narisa like! I love you Josh.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;I love you too, Princess. I also love playing with your
    little honey pot!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;You bad boy! You just want Narisa suck.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Guilty as charged.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>With an impish grin she attempted to give him a blowjob, but
    seeing her <br>
    beautiful lips wrapped around his erection and that blissful feeling Well,
    <br>
    let's just say it lasted about twenty seconds before he gave her his gift.
    Hey, <br>
    what can you say? He's a fourteen-year-old kid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>After toweling off and dressing, Narisa said her morning prayers
    as Josh <br>
    dressed. He gave her the usual Vidal Sassoon treatment as he dried her <br>
    hair along with paying homage to her dainty little feet. Josh thought to <br>
    himself, <i>I wonder if I now have a foot fetish?</i> After their morning
    frolic, <br>
    they went downstairs to greet the parental units.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>The family went to IHOP for breakfast and things started to become
    tense. <br>
    From Josh's experience, most people are pretty tolerant of other faiths and
    <br>
    cultures, but the Muslims he'd had contact with either at school or in other
    <br>
    public places were less traditional in their dress than Narisa was. She <br>
    became a little uncomfortable (from his perspective) with some of the <br>
    stares she was getting from people seeing her dressed in an abaya and <br>
    hajib. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>As usual, guys don't always read their wives correctly. Narisa, in
    fact, <br>
    became <i>very </i>uncomfortable with the stares she was getting and felt
    like <br>
    bursting into tears thinking, <i>For the love of Allah, how will I ever
    survive <br>
    here? I feel like a freak!<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>They managed to get through breakfast with words of reassurance
    from <br>
    Josh and his parents, but things were more of the same at the grocery <br>
    store. No one said anything to her or was impolite, but Narisa did get some
    <br>
    looks that said she definitely was in a whole different world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>At this point, Narisa did break down and started crying and she
    felt even <br>
    more embarrassed and humiliated because people were now staring at her <br>
    as she cried. She felt so out of place, almost as if she were some sort of
    alien <br>
    from another planet. It took several minutes and a lot of reassurance from <br>
    Marie to calm her down so that they could finish shopping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>On the ride home, Narisa was pretty quiet. She was content to
    snuggle <br>
    under Josh's reassuring embrace and be passive. They got home and put <br>
    the groceries away in subdued silence. Sitting at the breakfast bar, Marie <br>
    began to talk to Narisa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Taking her hands gently, she said, &quot;Daughter, I think now is
    the time to <br>
    talk about a few things. Before I say anything, tell us exactly what and
    how <br>
    you're feeling right now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa had tears running down her cheeks, but wasn't crying
    openly. <br>
    Looking down she said softly, &quot;I will <i>never</i> fit in. People are
    staring at me <br>
    like I'm from outer space. What's it going to be like in school? I feel
    sad, <br>
    hurt and completely out of place. People don't even know me and they look <br>
    at me with distrust and fear.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Narisa? Sweetheart?&quot; her mother-in-law coaxed, trying
    to get her to look <br>
    up. &quot;Look at me.&quot; (Narisa looked up). &quot;You need to
    understand human <br>
    nature a little. No one knows you or the fact that you just arrived from
    Iran <br>
    yesterday. People fear and distrust what they don't understand. Although <br>
    Americans are fairly tolerant of other cultures, they also are puzzled by <br>
    someone's reluctance to accept some of our culture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Take me for example. Here in America or any other western
    country, I can <br>
    dress as I am now: in a pair of jeans, a blouse and with my head uncovered <br>
    or I can dress in an abaya and hajib in Tehran. I am who I am no matter <br>
    how I dress. My faith in God isn't changed nor is the love I have for my <br>
    husband or son. The person I see as myself isn't altered or changed and <br>
    neither is how I act simply because I dress a certain way. The Bible tells
    us <br>
    to respect and accept the customs of others. Accepting a dress code of a <br>
    different culture has no bearing whatsoever on who I am or what my beliefs <br>
    are. It just means that I have a different understanding of other people's <br>
    customs and culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;I'd like you to think about that for a moment. If you were
    to wear a pair of <br>
    jeans and a blouse, a dress or even a skirt and maybe a headscarf, would <br>
    you feel that your faith in Allah is polluted or sinful? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa just shrugged, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;You cannot, and I mean cannot, change what people think of
    you <br>
    regardless of what you wear to a certain degree. If you dress like a <br>
    prostitute, people will probably assume you are one, but we're talking of <br>
    normal, conservative dress. There's no law in America that requires you to <br>
    hide yourself from the world to prove that you love God. In fact, the <span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>government doesnt tell
    its citizens how to dress. Here, people's faith is<br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>a private thing and not questioned
    by people, nor does the government try<br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>to control what people think when
    they see how someone is dressed. That<br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>doesn't mean that there aren't
    people who dress to outwardly show their faith.<br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>There are Muslim women that wear
    some sort of head covering, and some<br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>do wear a hajib along with western
    dress. Then again, some Muslim women<br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>don't wear a head covering at all.
    Some Catholic nuns still wear a<br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>traditional habit. People are
    generally more accepting when they see that<br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>you are somewhat accepting of the
    culture in which you live.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;That doesn't mean that you have to wear a short skirt that
    ends right <br>
    below your bottom and a blouse so tight that every contour of your skin is <br>
    on display, but if you did, that's your right, although Steve or I would
    never <br>
    let you walk out of the house dressed like that. There is absolutely
    nothing <br>
    wrong with dressing conservatively, modestly yet stylishly and still
    profess <br>
    your faith as a Muslim woman. Can you understand what I'm trying to <br>
    say?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;I think so,&quot; Narisa answered, &quot;but I would feel so
    uncomfortable dressing <br>
    like that. What if a boy were to say something to me about the way I look
    or <br>
    lusted after me? What would I do?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;I've got news for you, Princess,&quot; Josh interjected.
    &quot;Even in Tehran, Hasan <br>
    and I looked at girls and they looked back. You know how the game is <br>
    played, right?&quot; She blushed and nodded. &quot;You'll never stop a guy
    from <br>
    checking you out because that's human nature: guys like girls and girls
    like <br>
    guys, but that has nothing to do with what kind of person you are or how <br>
    you feel about yourself. There are some guys who can't take no for an <br>
    answer or can be rude in their gestures or approach, but then they'll be
    like <br>
    that regardless of how you dress.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Steve spoke up, &quot;You also have to look at things this way,
    Narisa, Some of <br>
    those same impolite and rude boys will torment and tease you all the more <br>
    if you're in traditional dress simply because you are different. Again, <br>
    people fear what they don't understand. All we're trying to say is that you
    <br>
    might want to consider what your life will be like here in America and see
    if <br>
    dressing less traditionally and being more accepting of your new culture is
    <br>
    something you can live with. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;There's not one person in this room that will pressure you
    into doing <br>
    something you don't want to do. It's your decision if you wish to continue <br>
    to wear your traditional attire. We will love you no matter how you dress. <br>
    As your guardians, Marie and I would never let you dress inappropriately <br>
    whether you are Muslim or not. You will dress properly, modestly and <br>
    tastefully as a young girl your age should. Besides, you need to check with
    <br>
    your husband: if you think something is okay to wear but your husband <br>
    thinks it's too sexy or vice-versa, then you should compromise and dress in
    <br>
    a way that doesn't cause any friction between the two of you, right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa nodded and asked her husband, &quot;Would you think I was
    dressing <br>
    like a prostitute if I wore jeans or a skirt to school?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh looked at her sternly and replied, &quot;First of all, I
    don't want to hear you <br>
    refer to yourself like that ever again. Never! You are <i>not</i> a
    prostitute, have <br>
    never acted like a prostitute and would <i>never</i> disgrace yourself or
    me by <br>
    acting like one. You've got nothing to feel guilty about. You were looking <br>
    for your brother, not promoting yourself to pick up a man for sex. That's <br>
    some people's perverted way to keep a woman from being treated fairly like <br>
    a human being with the same rights as men have. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;You're my wife and I love you with all my heart, regardless
    of whether you <br>
    wear jeans, a skirt or an abaya. I trust you and I trust your love for me.
    I <br>
    don't think you're going to act any differently based on how you dress, are
    <br>
    you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;No! Of course not!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Well then it's up to you if you'd like to start out with
    something like pants <br>
    or jeans and a blouse. Once you're comfortable with that then maybe you <br>
    can move on to skirts and dresses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Make no mistake about it,&quot; Marie warned, &quot;when you
    get to school, you'll <br>
    probably see some girls dressed pretty sexily, but you have to remember, <br>
    they're trying to attract boys. Those girls usually attract the wrong kind
    of <br>
    boys but they feel a sense of accomplishment anyway. Here in America, <br>
    thirteen-year-old girls aren't married, but they <i>are</i> trying to
    attract a boy. <br>
    They are just starting to learn about boys and dating and that's normal. <br>
    Some girls are confused, pressured by peers and some are looking for love <br>
    and affection and they think that by having sex with a boy they'll get the <br>
    affection they seek. You and Josh are in a totally different situation: you
    <br>
    don't have to attract a mate - you've already got one. There's nothing
    wrong <br>
    with dressing like a woman, feeling attractive and still being faithful in <br>
    heart and deed to your husband, do you understand?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa affirmatively nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Steven and I understand your culture and for that reason, we
    can better <br>
    understand and accept your marriage and that your marriage to Josh is a <br>
    loving and beautiful thing. Others may not understand that kids your age <br>
    can have an adult relationship built on love. You two are not like two
    young <br>
    teenagers fumbling around trying to discover sex like most kids. Both of <br>
    you fully understand the difference between the loving sexual expression in
    <br>
    a marriage and teenage shenanigans hidden from parents. Now, what <br>
    would you like you do? Would you like to think about this for a while or do
    <br>
    you feel that you might want to take a few steps and do what girls all over
    <br>
    the world love to do and that is to shop for some new clothes? Want to see
    how <br>
    pretty you can be?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>&quot;Josh, are you sure it's okay for me to dress like an
    American girl?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>He smiled and nodded saying. &quot;It's perfectly fine with me.
    Just do whats<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>comfortable for you&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh chuckled inwardly remembering that his dad used to joke and
    say that <br>
    the way to a woman's heart is through a man's wallet and the Persian <br>
    Princess was a woman! She got a twinkle in her eyes and a broad smile <br>
    slowly came over her and she blushed. Her mother-in-law quipped, &quot;Come
    <br>
    on, Daughter, let's go shopping!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh looked at his dad and Steve just shook his head, reached for
    his wallet <br>
    and gave it to his wife and said to his son, &quot;When they get this way,
    just go <br>
    with the flow. Keep your mouth shut and hope they don't break the bank. <br>
    We're in for a long day!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Holding hands, Narisa and her newly adopted mom giggled as they
    headed <br>
    for the door with the husbands following meekly behind. Marie suddenly <br>
    stopped and asked her, &quot;Headscarf or not?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa contemplated and Marie answered for her by saying,
    &quot;I'll bring a <br>
    couple and we'll decide later. How's that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Narisa nodded with a smile and they watched as Marie bolted
    upstairs and <br>
    returned a few minutes later with several headscarves: white, bone and <br>
    black. Stuffing them in her bag she said cheerfully, &quot;Now we're ready,
    <br>
    Daughter!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Into the car they piled with Narisa clutching Josh's arm closely
    in a fit of <br>
    giggles as Marie told her husband while they pulled away from the drive, <br>
    &quot;To the mall, Steven. Damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Josh knew his little pixie was pretty but he never realized just
    how sexy his <br>
    little princess was until he saw her in a pair of tight jeans and top. She <br>
    modeled a crop-top with that alluring bare midriff and her tiny innie belly
    <br>
    button showing with a hand-covered giggle just to get him riled up, but to <br>
    his chagrin, she put it back. She ended up getting some jeans and slacks in
    <br>
    different colors and tops that she could mix and match. Marie, the woman <br>
    Narisa would come to love as her own mother, found her four knee-length <br>
    skirts that looked great on her with some thigh-highs and some tights. She <br>
    even got three dresses. Josh and his dad gave each other approving looks <br>
    thinking the same thing: that tiny pixie looked hot!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>Next were shoes (Can't forget about shoes - and stylish boots can
    they?). <br>
    After that came a fall jacket and winter coat, neck-scarf and gloves, socks
    <br>
    and accessories such as hair combs, barrettes and scrunchies, lip-gloss and
    <br>
    on, and on, and on. Then, for the </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>,
    the giggling females <br>
    ducked into Victoria's Secrets well, you get the idea. Evidently, Narisa <br>
    took her mother's advice, relying on her mother-in-law's taste and by the <br>
    time they were shopped out, they'd spent six hours, been to umpteen <br>
    different shops and spent an untold sum of money. Narisa walked out of <br>
    the mall in a pair of designer jeans, pink top and her long, curly black <br>
    tresses billowing down her back as she confidently sash-shayed that <br>
    gorgeous little hiney next to Josh while glued to his arm. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
    Georgia'>The parental units were walking behind them as Steven quipped,
    &quot;Um, um, <br>
    um! Better get her a bodyguard, Josh. She'll be beating them off with a <br>
    baseball bat!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    jean-clad <br>
    butt and teased in her little schoolgirl voice, &quot;Hey mithter, can you help
    me <br>
    find my Daddy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

    find your daddy: Sugar Daddy that is!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
