"Can we pull into the lookout for a while please?" asked 
Fiona.

I indicated when I saw the exit sign a couple of 
kilometres later.  The forest closed in around us making 
the side road even darker.  My headlights illuminated 
only a series of trees and the curving centre line.

We appeared to be the only ones up here - there were 
other parking spots closer to town for the young drivers.

I pulled up looking towards the lights of our township 
and killed my headlights.  As my eyes readjusted, the 
lights glowed brighter.

"You can see the cars down there."

I looked over at Fiona.  "Want to get out for a while?"

"Okay."

I turned the interior light off so that didn't ruin our 
night vision.

At the front of the car I leaned next to Fiona at the 
railing for a few seconds before moving behind her, 
holding her as we looked over the expanse of darkness.  
She shivered.

"You cold?"

"No."

I hugged her closer and kissed the side of her neck.  She 
twisted and was suddenly facing me.  Her arms went under 
my jacket and her lips met mine.  We forgot the lights.

I'd enjoyed Shelley's youthful enthusiasm, even her 
blatant disregard for the opinion of her peers when it 
came to having a *MUCH* older boyfriend.  She certainly 
hadn't been shy.

Fiona was as enthusiastic but with 8 or 9 years headway 
she had definitely passed the point where girl became 
woman.  I enjoyed kissing her in different ways to the 
enjoyment Shelley evoked.  I tried not to dwell on the 
differences as we kissed but it was hard to think, "Mmm, 
that's new."

As Fiona's hands massaged my back and her body rubbed 
mine into arousal I regretted the delay we'd agreed to.  
I'm sure Fiona would have liked to have spent the rest of 
the evening getting to know me better without all these 
annoying clothes.

I behaved, barely; I'm not sure holding each other's 
butts as we ground our crotches together was really 
playing by the book but if Fiona said nothing I would 
keep quiet too.

Saturday night saw each of we three men seated beside our 
own younger daughter and our older girlfriend for the 
lack of a more definitive term.  We exchanged kisses on 
arrival (passion starters) and also on occasion through 
the night (much more sedate, affectionate without being 
offensive to the others present - especially the other 
men in their roles as fathers.)

Other than we often held the hand of the woman to our 
right (to the dismay of the younger woman seated across 
the table), we didn't behave much differently from one of 
our regular Saturday evenings.

Until about halfway through the evening.

We were gathered at my house and I asked Prue if she 
would get another bottle of soft drink and another of 
wine for the table.  She did, standing between Howard and 
Cass to put them in the centre of the table.

Howard's arm went behind her and she turned and gave him 
a warm kiss but not one that would disturb her father too 
much.  She then turned to Cass though and brought all 
conversation to a standstill.

Watching two women kiss can be highly erotic.  If one is 
your seventeen year old daughter it can also be highly 
disturbing.

The kiss just seemed to go on and on, morphing from one 
conjunction of lips to another in sexy succession.

When they finished Prue looked around the table.  "Cass 
and I have decided to work together to get Howard to 
accept both of us rather than competing for just one 
winner."

Cass seemed somewhat embarrassed over the revelation and 
Howard somewhat pleased.  Prue gave Howard and then Cass 
a far briefer kiss and resumed her seat next to me.  
Given what I had witnessed at the Prom I was only 
surprised rather than shocked.  I would be talking to 
Prue though, making sure she was freely entering into 
such a relationship rather than feeling she had to 
despite any reservations she might have.

---

We three men met again on Sunday afternoon at Howard's 
house.  There was a golf tournament on else we might have 
talked as we walked instead.  I am convinced that there 
was some sort of telepathy involved but regardless, our 
older daughters met at Richie's and the younger ones at 
mine.

Howard was at pains to assure us that, though he had put 
the suggestion forward and had encouraged both Cass and 
Prue to consider it, he had also made it clear that a 
willingness to participate wasn't going to be a criterion 
for his invitation to either, or both of them, to share 
his life.

"I'm sure you are both like me, flattered by the interest 
and attention but unsure if there is love involved."

We agreed.

"The six weeks will be a real bastard if I have to watch 
them kissing but I'm grateful in a way since it stops me 
jumping into bed with anyone and then regretting it if we 
decide not to remain a couple."

I knew what he meant.  I was probably half in love with 
Shelley and maybe a little more with Fiona on the basis 
of going out with them only once.  I fell in love easily 
but usually I realise it's unrequited and I can fall out 
of love without guilt or hurt feelings.

Maybe I just have a good imagination.  I do know that, 
when the love is returned, I am loyal and steadfast but 
that was where I had a problem - both Shelley and Fiona 
were returning that love or providing a darn good 
imitation.  I would have to make a decision.

"I've spoken to Prue and I'm satisfied she understands 
what she told us last night and that she doesn't feel 
coerced, though she does think she stands a better chance 
with you this way."

"I know.  I don't think they really believed I meant what 
I said.  In some ways this could backfire on me.  If I 
wasn't to fall in love with Prue say, but did love Cass, 
there would be all sorts of difficulties if the two of 
them were in love.  Once again, they could fall in love 
with each other and decide I *WAS* an old fart who 
couldn't do anything more for them.

    "I've loved two women who shared a mutual love as 
well and that worked out fine for quite a while.  This 
could end in much the same way and though that would hurt 
I have to say it *IS* better to have loved and lost.  I 
would prefer to love and keep loving though."

---

The ladies all met in the street between the three houses 
and, after a brief discussion, recombined into three 
pairs, each of which went to the older woman's bedroom to 
talk in privacy.

I heard a door open and Nick came out with Ange.  "Hi 
Dad.  We're just off to see Richie."

"Okay."

I guess I was just glad they weren't at each other's 
throats.

A little later there was a tap at the front door and I 
heard it open.  "It's only us - can we come in?"

I had little trouble guessing who Fiona had with her but 
it was still a surprise to see them with their arms 
around each other.

"Don't tell me - you've decided you are both in love and 
no longer need me to go on any more dates with you."

"No silly!  We've decided to offer you another choice.  
Either or both!"

"There is still 'Neither'."

They were crestfallen.

"But I doubt that is seriously an option unless you both 
change *YOUR* minds."

"We might if you do that again."

"So, sit down and tell me how you see this happening."

---

Six weeks, five really once the suggestion was made, can 
be an eternity or nothing.  Shelley and Ange both had 
their birthdays during the following week and we had the 
usual combined celebration on the Saturday at Richie's.

They now regretted that they had objected to us fooling 
around with their older sisters but it did give us more 
opportunity to see that we could interact as triples 
without sex being an overwhelming factor.  (Is there a 
better word for a couple plus one?)  It *WAS* still a 
factor, none of us could avoid that, but at least we 
found other ways to spend our time.

Dating varied.  I took Shelley out sometimes and Fiona at 
others but most of the time we went together.  I think 
they actually got on best of the three pairs of girls.

Prue was okay with being with Cass and Cass was fine in 
private, bashful amongst the rest of us, and fearful of 
any suggestion they were more than friends in public.

If Nick and Ange didn't mind the public seeing them it 
was because they were lukewarm all the time.  They were 
friends who were lovers rather than being two people in 
love.

Shelley and Fiona must have broken the rule when they 
talked together to find if they were comfortable with a 
sexual relationship.  They never said as much but I can't 
see how they would know they wouldn't have any problem if 
I agreed to a three-way partnership.  With the offer I 
realised I wasn't going to throw away the birds in my 
hand for all the potential others throughout our bush-
filled town.

The real test came with Prue's 18th.  I don't know who 
was more excited - it wasn't only the women.

The party was held at my house and our Saturday dinner 
finished early that week and while each man took home two 
daughters; for the first time they weren't his own.

Shelley and Fiona assisted me in a minimal cleanup.  
Dishes were rinsed and stacked for the morning, waste was 
bagged so it didn't blow around.

I was intimidated by having to face both at once but I 
had a solution.  I deserted the last of the cleanup, 
asking them to attend to it for me.  Then I took a hasty 
shower - alone.

I returned dressed in my robe and suggested to Shelley 
that she should freshen up and rejoin us.  With raised 
eyebrows, Shelley left to change in Prue's room and then 
showered.

I sat with Fiona, reliving some of our dates and taking 
them a little further than we'd allowed ourselves at the 
time.  I think her motor was idling smoothly when Shelley 
joined us - also in her robe.  I had her stand in front 
of me and undid the belt.  Shelley blushed as I parted 
the front and both Fiona and I gazed on her charms.

"Fiona, if you'd like to freshen up too, perhaps we can 
sample some of these goodies."

With a quick kiss to each of us, Fiona hurried to Nick's 
room.

I looked at Shelley and had her step closer so I could 
wrap my lips around a nipple.  It was what we had both 
been waiting for - for far longer than six weeks.  
Shelley held the back of my head but I wasn't going 
anywhere.

She breathed in and then laughed.  I looked up.

"Oh don't stop.  This is wonderful."

"Then what is so funny?"

"I'm laughing because I'm happy.  I love you and I get to 
have you."

I didn't want to spoil the moment by pointing out that 
might not be the case in the long term - there would be 
time enough for heartbreak when we split up, if that was 
fated to happen.

Shelley sat over just one of my legs, her bare pussy 
leaving a damp spot as we kissed.  I felt her hand slide 
down between us and she wrapped her fingers around my 
erect prick.

"Can I sit on the floor and just look at it for a while?"

I was going to be embarrassed but such an examination 
would have to happen sometime and I expected to be able 
to claim reciprocal rights.  I nodded and Shelley knelt 
between my feet after pushing my knees apart.

"It looks neat.  Rather majestic standing up like that."

My thank you was probably inane but, really, what do you 
say when a virginal young lady compliments your wang?

"I like how the blood vessels stand out down here and yet 
up here it's so smooth."

I showed her how to retract my foreskin.

"Oh wow, that's great too.  I was going to say cute but I 
guess you wouldn't like that."

"Well I think some of your expressions are probably 
cuter.  You have a cheeky grin when you think of 
something - yes, like thaaa..."

Shelley had retracted my foreskin again and then taken 
the whole of my knob into her mouth where she inhaled.  
Given time and a willing student I would explain about 
blowjobs but I wasn't about to rate her poorly on a first 
attempt; she avoided teeth and wasn't excessively 
enthusiastic.

Fiona joined us as Shelley was busy checking out my 
scrotum with some guidance from me on what to avoid.  I 
waved her to sit beside me and turned to kiss her.

"Starting without me, hey?"

"Well, continuing in your absence perhaps though we can 
bring you up to speed if you like."

"I like."

I released the tie around her waist and opened her robe.

"Do these look mouth-watering to you Shelley?"

I didn't wait for an answer but bent over and captured 
the closest nipple between my lips and gently sucked it 
deeper into my mouth where my tongue attacked it.  I 
noticed Shelley beside me and felt Fiona stiffen a second 
time - Shelley apparently found Fiona's breasts as 
attractive as I did.

Fiona held us to her, enjoying the synergy of two mouths 
at once.  I think she became truly grateful of her 
father's history at that stage and probably even forgave 
her mother.  Eventually I straightened and kissed Fiona 
instead while Shelley continued.

"That was wonderful.  I feel all tingly."

"And that was only to warm you up."

I tapped Shelley's shoulder and she gave up Fiona's 
nipple but kept her hand possessively on the breast.

"Do you have another cute look coming up or do you think 
I should try to copy your expression," I asked.

Shelley looked puzzled for a second then a cheeky grin 
spread across her face.

"Wait a second.  Do you ladies object to us moving into 
the bedroom?"

They didn't of course and I led the way then had Fiona 
lie down in the middle of my new king size mattress.  I'd 
already pulled the covers down in anticipation - sheets 
are so much easier to launder!

"Will you trust me Fiona?"

"I'm naked on your bed.  If you have any kinks I guess 
it's better I find out now."

"Would you bend your knees up then and spread your feet 
and knees please."

She did and I bent across her and began to lick the far 
nipple so her view was obscured.  I tiptoed my fingers 
across her belly and rubbed my palm over pussy, mound and 
pubes without any suggestion of penetration.  Having done 
so I crooked my finger at Shelley.

I felt her approach and Fiona stiffened but showed she 
was willing to trust me even if she had to get used to 
the situation.  I reached out again and gently spread 
Fiona's lips; Shelley brushed over the upper side of my 
fingers and I moved them away as I felt her tongue push 
between them.

Shelley might have been inexperienced but she wasn't 
ignorant nor was she hesitant to apply her book learning.  
I heard simultaneous murmurs of satisfaction from both of 
them and sat up.  Fiona was smiling and I was warmed when 
she turned that on me before lifting up on her elbows to 
look along her body and into Shelley's eyes.

"I rather like eating pussy myself," I advised, "so I'd 
appreciate your both telling me if there is anything I do 
that you don't enjoy or prefer.  I am aware that too much 
of a good thing can still be a problem so I won't do just 
the nicer things but hopefully I don't do any of the 
nastier ones.  You both seem to be enjoying that.  Is 
Fiona tasty, Shelley?"

"Yes."  She quickly resumed her eating.

"Do you want to come, Fiona, love?"

Fiona turned her head rapidly at the endearment.

"But you..."

"Will come I'm sure."

"Kiss me then."

I did and she pulled my hand onto her tit and held it 
there.  I worked her nipple beneath her own hand and our 
tongues fought while Shelley dined.

Fiona began to react and I broke away from her lips to 
guide Shelley.

"Don't stop now, love.  A little more clit contact but 
not too much and see she comes."

I leaned across Fiona's face and put my lips to her ear.

"Perhaps next time you can have Shelley sitting on your 
face while I'm fucking you?  Or would you prefer I was on 
my back with one of you on my prick and the other on my 
face so you could kiss and play with each other's 
breasts?  Or maybe you could be where Shelley is and I'd 
slip into you from behind so your face kept banging into 
Shelley's pussy and you had to hang onto her hips to keep 
your place?"

Fiona's imagination must have been every bit as good as 
mine because she pulled me back to her lips and kissed me 
bruisingly hard while wave after wave of pleasure had her 
lifting her hips from the mattress.  Before long she was 
pushing me away so she could stop Shelley; then, when I 
encouraged Shelley to crawl up over Fiona's body, Fiona 
almost pulled her into place.

Their lips locked and I lamented that *I* had hoped to 
taste Fiona-flavoured kisses but now the flavour would be 
all gone.  The two of them laughed.

"You *CAN* always taste the source - just not for a few 
minutes."

"You still want me around then?  Looks like you two are 
cosy enough without me."

"Yeah, this is kind of cosy.  I don't think I'm ready to 
throw you out the door quite yet though.  You kiss rather 
well and you had a few good ideas."

"Ideas?  What were they?" asked a suddenly alert Shelley.

"Shall we ditch the robes and discuss them?"

---

I didn't seek any details of what went on in the other 
houses but, by the next Saturday dinner, clothing and 
possessions had been shifted from house to house and our 
daughters all finally left home.

We were close enough that we all still saw each other 
even without considering the ongoing Saturday get 
togethers.  We were all happy but we did start some 
gossip which centred mainly around the married women with 
unmatched sons who saw something wrong in us men firstly 
cradle-snatching and secondly not marrying one and 
releasing the other back into the pool of available women 
so there was more chance their sons would find someone.

I had to wonder if they were so dense that they couldn't 
work out *WHY* the excess of "available women" (with or 
without our six) had rejected their sons.

Among the younger women and men it raised a different set 
of conversation topics that quickly spread through the 
community.  Those who were still classed as "available" 
who didn't really want to move away began to wonder if 
being a second - albeit unofficial - wife would be a bad 
thing.  The men who had a woman (legally married or not) 
began to consider whether they could possibly get even 
more sex by introducing a second or even a third woman 
into their household.

One of the triples that had been at the girls' Prom had 
openly set up house together rather than heading off to 
college and the other young men quizzed him over his 
lifestyle, the good points, and the downfalls.  They came 
to see that it wasn't all roses but it still looked 
attractive - if they found the right women.

The "taken" women weren't ignorant of their partners' 
interest.  All it needed was for one husband to say "How 
would it be if you had another woman to help around the 
house or bring in more income?" and the ball was rolling.  
No matter her answer she would no doubt meet her friends 
with, "Do you know what [insert name] suggested to me!?"

The other wives would then pick up on comments they had 
overheard or that their own partners had made and would 
see the possibility of their own household being 
affected.

For some - those who might have had a "very close" 
girlfriend during High School - there was the opportunity 
to link up with a former lover while gaining a 
sympathetic ally against *THEIR* partner's foibles.

For some others it would be a time for panic and an 
attempt to show that they were all the woman their 
partner needed.  The mail order lingerie catalogues found 
our town an unusual source of business for a while.

It wasn't just those who were affected though.  We three 
men might have been considered the most eligible 
bachelors in town by our loving daughters but there were 
other widowed and divorced men who suddenly began to tidy 
themselves up and to invite out someone much younger - 
often a daughter's or daughter-in-law's friend since they 
were the ones more frequently encountered.

And that only gave the gossips even more to consider.

---

Shelley went away to college happily assured that while 
Fiona was keeping my bed warm she would also be keeping 
Shelley's side free for whenever she could spare a 
weekend off and for her breaks.  I'd made it clear to her 
that she was not to feel locked into a relationship if 
she found someone else but by that time we had all grown 
deeply in love with each other and she had no interest in 
anyone new.

At her insistence we'd discussed commitment rings in 
place of wedding rings.  I wasn't opposed but hadn't 
thought I should stake my claim as such.  Since Fiona 
agreed, we visited a jeweller and from that day onwards I 
wore a gold band on my left hand as did my ladies.  
Shelley insisted it stopped a lot of guys pestering her 
and said some of the other women in her class had bought 
their own rings for just that reason.

Her trips home were exciting and exhausting as were the 
visits we managed to make to see her.

During one trip home we discussed children and Shelley 
was delighted that Fiona was feeling clucky.

"You can have yours and when I graduate I can have one 
and they will be just the right gap.  You could have 
another then if you want and they would be like twins."

She took an active interest in the lovemaking when I was 
trying to get Fiona pregnant.  With two children already 
I wasn't so sure I needed any more let alone the 
suggested three but I could afford to have them and I 
knew Fiona and Shelley wanted them so their wishes became 
my desires.  Hell, practising was fun and so was keeping 
going until we finally got it right.  It turned out we 
weren't the only family trying but the mutual desire to 
keep it quiet until a pregnancy was confirmed meant we 
all surprised each other with our ETA being first, Prue's 
next about 4 weeks later, Cass three weeks after that and 
Nick's another 2 weeks on.  I was going to be a father 
for the third time and a grandfather twice over in the 
space of two months!

The gossips would have a field day!

One thing I was sure of though, I would not be escorting 
anyone to the Prom in another 18 years!
