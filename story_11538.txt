From the pen of Bertram W. Wooster: In which Bertie gets himself into a great deal of trouble

Chapter 3: Mr. Marcus Roberson

So, that's how I came to be in the remarkable posish of seeing Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson sitting on my sofa and smoking cigarettes. Although, to be accurate in my facts, as I'm sure Holmes would want, I should say that Dr. Watson was sitting on my sofa and Mr. Holmes was smoking cigarettes, for Holmes had not stopped moving since he'd arrived. He prowled about the room puffing away until Jeeves had to open a window for all the smoke.

"Will he come soon, do you think?" I asked.

Holmes replied. "He is not without cunning or patience. He will plan his next move, reconnoitre the building, perhaps befriend the doorman. He lost his advantage when he lost the packet and he won't strike until the moment is right."

"How long are we going to have to wait? It's going to get a bit crowded if we all have to bed down before he comes around. I've a limited number of beds, you know." Aside from my room and Jeeves's room, I had only the one guestroom. It would be unaccountably rude to force my guests to share a bed. Jeeves, I'm sure, would not be happy were I to displace him from his room. I supposed I could give up my room and get my eight hours with Jeeves, which, upon reflection, was not an unpleasant thought at all, although I suspect that Jeeves, with his dashed inconvenient feudal spirit and intense sense of privacy, would not approve.

Holmes wasn't at all troubled by the notion of night-time overcrowding. "If he chooses to come under the cover of darkness, which I think likely, it will be many hours yet before he shows himself, but I am sure he will not leave it later than tonight,." Holmes smiled grimly. "After all, he doesn't realize how close I am, and is undoubtedly hoping that he will retrieve the packet before I do. Watson, keep your revolver at hand in case I'm mistaken. Jeeves, a word with you, please." He motioned to Jeeves and the two of them stepped away into the dining room and spoke quietly amongst themselves. No orders were given to me. For all that this adventure was happening in my own rooms, I was beginning to feel quite shut out of it, as if I were reading it in The Strand or watching it in the cinema. I wandered over to where Watson was seated. He looked as out of sorts as I felt.

Through the open doorway, I watched Jeeves and Holmes talk animatedly, pointing here and there about the room. Even from where I sat, I could see the keen concentration in the straight lines of Jeeves's shoulders and the tilt of his head. A funny little knot twisted in my stomach. "I say, they're getting along like pair of dear old school chums."

"Holmes has never been impressed by class distinction," Watson replied.

"A Communist?" I said with some surprise. In the stories, he was always perfectly chuffed to help out royalty.

"No, he's not political at all. He has no agenda, no desire to break the class system; he simply doesn't care about it. In his mind, a street urchin may have as much value as a baron. More, in some cases."

"Jeeves doesn't care for Communists. He's a good, old-fashioned sort of chap. Mind you, sometimes he takes it too far. He doesn't like to experiment, even with something as small and innocuous as a hat." I pointed to the cobalt blue trilby on the hat stand. "I doubt I'll be allowed to keep it for a week. I'll fight him, of course, but no matter how firm my resolve, somehow he always wins out in the end."

"That is the danger with associating with strong-willed, quick-witted men," Watson said. "If you aren't careful, you can find yourself positively bullied."

Watson was watching Holmes just as I had been watching Jeeves. I recalled some of the barbed words they had exchanged earlier. "I say, is everything on the up-and-up with you and Mr. Holmes? You two seem a bit pipped, vexed, cross, downright inimical."

Watson's brows raised in innocent surprise. "Not at all. When he's on a case he becomes extremely focused and doesn't pay much mind to anything not directly relating to it. That is all."

I was not for a moment taken in by his assiduously blank look, for I was used to Jeeves and one would have to be pretty good indeed at adopting the statue-like, unaffected-by-the-world look to beat out Jeeves in that arena. "No, that's not it at all. He's not simply ignoring you, he's downright shunning you. I've seen this sort of thing before with Cousin Angela and my friend Tuppy. Angela and Tuppy are engaged, you understand. That is, they've been engaged, on and off, for ages now. The 'offs' happen when one of them, usually Tuppy, says something thoughtless and the other, usually Angela, takes it poorly and says something cutting in return. Before you know it each refuses to speak to the other, and then Jeeves and I have to go and set things right between them, after which they go right back to being happily affianced. You didn't say that Holmes's hat makes him look like a Manchester Terrier, did you? That's the sort of thing Tuppy says that gets him into trouble with Angela."

Watson was struck mute for a few seconds, moustache twitching under the hand that he placed over his mouth and his eyes creased with merriment. His delighted astonishment must have been provoked by the shock that I'd seen so clearly to the heart of the situation, for such is the keen insight I possess. It took him many seconds to gather his wits. He cleared his throat. "No. No, it was nothing like that."

"Well then, tell me all. I've a knack for sorting out rummy problems. My friends come to me for help all the time. Although in truth they usually ask for Jeeves," I frowned. "But in the end my assistance has always proved invaluable."

"Thank you for the offer, but it's really not necessary."

"I insist." My general air of shrewdness and sagacity beyond my years must have swayed him, for after a moment's pause and a thoughtful sigh, he spoke.

"Holmes is a…"

He seemed at a loss for words, so I jumped in with both feet to give him a push just as Jeeves so often does for me when I find that the right term has proved elusive. "A gentleman? A detective? An odd bird?"

"…A demanding person. He is demanding both of others and himself. He is a man who despises error as much as he despises injustice. Holmes would not have been so foolish as to put anything in writing. Holmes would never blithely entrust his reputation and life on the false security of vaults and locks. I committed a grave error; I failed to live up to his expectations." Bowing his head and letting his eyes follow the pattern on the rug, Watson murmured as much to that rug as to me. "I suspect I must disappoint him quite a lot, if he desires me to live up to the sort of perfection he tries to demand of himself."

The words struck a chord, a veritable harmonic polyphony, inside me. Through the dining room door, I could see Jeeves seated at the table across from Mr. Holmes. His sleek dark hair and chiselled jaw brought to mind both the image of a dashing hero and a debonair man-about-town, and his facility of thought would give any old, dusty philosopher-a Plato or a Hobbes-a run for his money. He was, as I have said many a time, a paragon among men, as near perfect as any earthly being could be. Yet for some reason, although he surely could have been a butler at a ducal manor or an Oxford don or even Prime Minister if he wanted to, Jeeves was still here.

"Jeeves is still here," I said to myself.

"I beg your pardon?" Watson asked.

"Jeeves is still here," I repeated. From the expression on Watson's face, I deduced that this had not alleviated his confusion, so I added, "Jeeves is a bit like Holmes, you see. He's a chap around whom all others must pale in comparison. Whereas I, although not without some small bit of intellect-I did win the Scripture Knowledge prize as a schoolboy after all-am no more than a plodding oaf, a dunce, an idiot when compared to Jeeves. Despite this, he remains in my service even though there are many gentlemen who, seeing what a remarkable valet he is, have tried to lure him away. Granted, Jeeves and I have hit a few rough patches now and again, the most dire being that business with the banjolele, and there have been a few acrimonious moments involving ties, hats, dress jackets, waistcoats, shirts, and other bits and bobs of apparel, but through it all he remains steadfast." I frowned as I remembered. "Except for the banjolele incident. He abandoned me for Chuffy Chuffnell for a full week then. It was the worst week of my life and it was only luck and the house fire that brought him back. And then there was the moustache episode. I don't imagine Mr. Holmes ever denounced you over your moustache."

Recalling the banjolele incident made me suddenly less sure of myself and Jeeves's continued place at my side. What had begun as speech to raise the spirits, by the end left me feeling less cheered than before. Watson gave me an avuncular pat on the shoulder, and the quirk of a smile on his face indicated that at least his spirits had been raised, so the exercise was not a complete hash.

At last, Jeeves and Holmes returned to the sitting room. Holmes immediately ducked down behind the sofa to crawl around the floor back there. I craned my neck to see what he was up to but couldn't make heads or tails out of his actions. Watson appeared as perplexed as I, though with an air of resignation like a man who's so used to confusion that it has ceased to be a novelty. Jeeves, meanwhile, stood before me in the stuffed-frog way he does when he is preparing to announce that dinner is served or a visitor is at the door.

"I have informed Mr. Holmes of the most effective locations of concealment. He proposes that we arrange an ambush here, if it is agreeable to you, sir."

"Of course, an ambush!" I turned in my seat and, resting my hands on the back of the sofa, leaned far over it to observe Holmes. "You must be looking for the best place to see the door. It's just like this one bit in Murder in the Light where private eye Eddie Flint gets the drop on Al Giordano." I glanced at Jeeves with a grin on my face.

Jeeves was less excited about the whole thing than I. Not that he wore anything so commonplace as a frown, but his face was altogether too expressionless and his mouth too straight for him to be anything but displeased. "Might I remind you of the very real dangers present in this proposed course of action?"

"You know what I say to that, Jeeves? I say 'Pshaw'. Great-great-great-however-many-times-great grandfather Wooster did not fight at Agincourt so that his descendant could turn tail when danger reared its head. No, we will stand our ground, boldly meet our foe, and vanquish the vile villain."

Rather than being uplifted by my, if I may say so, rather stirring speech, Jeeves seemed more disapproving than ever. His brows drew down over his eyes and a dark cast shadowed his mien. "As a strategy, pure bravery has been proved by recent world events to be unsuccessful."

It was a moment or two before his meaning sunk in, but when it did my jaw dropped. "Well, I say, Jeeves, I say," I sputtered. "My sitting room is hardly Ypres."

"My point remains; if you are going to insist on this endeavour it would behove you, sir, to be exceedingly cautious."

"Yes, yes, of course," I replied airily.

"Do you own a gun, Mr. Wooster?" Holmes interrupted, popping up from behind the sofa. I nearly fell off in surprise.

"A gun? Goodness me, no. I'm not much of hunting fellow. All that tromping about the fields struck me as quite a bit of work for dashed little benefit. My Aunt Dahlia, on the other hand, she has rifles and guns of all sorts, a whole room full of them, remnants from her Quorn and Pytchley days."

"Pity. When Roberson comes, he will in all likelihood engage you in conversation, hoping that he can retrieve the packet from you through guile. When he does, respond casually, but do not approach him nor let him approach you. Your life may depend on it. When he asks about the packet, tell him that you have it in the kitchen and will fetch it for him. You and Jeeves will then depart, taking yourselves out of immediate danger and leaving the task of apprehending him to Watson and me. Do you understand?"

"It all seems simple enough," I replied. "I let the chap in, take him off his guard with my good-natured charm, then biff off while you finish the job."

Holmes merely sighed, but Watson said, "Yes, that's just fine."

Then an objection sprang to my mind. "Wait! What do I say to him?"

"Whatever you would normally say in this sort of situation," Holmes said.

"But I've never been in this sort of situation before. I don't have criminals popping over after supper every day. Well, except for old Barmy on occasion, but he's not really a criminal. That whole affair with the Venus statuette and the banana was just a misunderstanding. You see, he-"

"Greet him as you would any gentleman stranger who arrived at your door. You lost a packet of your own, yes?"

"Yes, my novel. And I'm bally upset over the loss. I'm supposed to-"

"Ask him about your packet. He will expect you to be concerned about it."

"Yes, all right, if you-"

"Don't, under any circumstances, mention Watson or me or look in the direction we'll be hiding."

"Right, I-"

"If he becomes wary, try to extricate yourself from the room immediately but without arousing his doubts further."

"I-"

"Don't let him take you off guard. He's as changeable as wind and water."

My head was dizzy with all these instructions. "I'm not sure I can do this."

"If you don't talk to him, he'll be suspicious." Holmes gazed at me with an assessing eye. "Perhaps Jeeves should be the one to lead him into our trap."

"No, I gave you my word as a Wooster that I would carry through, and I mean to do it." Holmes said nothing, but the weight of his obvious disapprobation was heavy. Keen to prove my worth, I said, "I'm sure if I could practice, you know, a rehearsal or two, I'd be good to go."

"A rehearsal," Holmes intoned flatly.

"Yes. Like a play."

"It's worth a try," Watson said. "Holmes, would you?"

"If I must," he replied. He then slithered to the front door and stood in the doorway. "Imagine that I am Roberson, and Jeeves has just admitted me into your home."

"Oh, right, well…" I cleared my throat. "What-ho, old chap."

Holmes's face cracked into a sudden and blinding smile. It was the most unnerving thing I'd ever seen. On any other man it would be bright and cheery, but it was so out of place on Holmes's pale, narrow face that it looked more like the grin of a carnival mask. "Mr. Wooster, so glad you're in. It seems I accidentally walked off with your packet when we bumped into each other earlier." Even his voice was different, deeper, huskier, with the faintest trace of a Cornish accent.

I was still put off by that unexpected smile. The longer it stayed there, the more it seemed to melt into his face, seeping into the cracks, as it were, until it seemed like an utterly natural expression and the mask became flesh. "I…er…yes. That is, yes, my packet. I'm quite keen to get it back you know. It's very important. It's this novel, you see, and, well, it's not much, but I did put a lot of effort into it, you know, and-"

"And I believe you have a packet of mine."

"Yes, it's…where is it?" I muttered that last bit to Jeeves. He flicked his eyes towards the kitchen in response. "Yes, that's right, the kitchen. It's in the kitchen. Let me go fetch it for you." Actions followed speech and I made my way kitchenwards. Stopping at the end of the sitting room I asked, "Is that all right?"

"Well, Roberson may think you're a half-wit, but then-"

"Holmes!" Watson scolded. "That's uncalled for even from you."

"It's all right," I assured Watson. "Aunt Dahlia calls me 'young blot' and 'fathead' and 'nincompoop' all the time, and she actually likes me. You should hear what Aunt Agatha calls me." Despite my reassurances, I was touched by Watson's concern. Jeeves, too, gave Watson a quietly grateful look before facing Holmes with all the censure he would give a lime green spotted tie.

Seeing that he was besieged on all sides, some of the biting fire in Holmes's eyes cooled as his thoughts turned reflective. "Yes," Holmes said at last. "Yes, you'll do all right, Mr. Wooster." Then Holmes turned away from me, giving the others directions. "Watson, you've better aim than I. Your position will be behind the sideboard where you'll have a good shot at him if it comes to that. If Roberson so much as twitches his fingers, you know what to do."

Watson nodded once as Holmes continued, "Jeeves, once you've admitted Roberson, stay close to Mr. Wooster. And Mr. Wooster," I perked up when I heard my name. "Don't dawdle with Roberson. Let him in then get out of the way."

All this business struck me as rather complicated, and I wondered if it wouldn't be easier to simply let the police deal with it. "I say, wouldn't it be easier just to call the police and let them pick him up?"

"As far as the official force is concerned, he's a reformed and law-abiding penitent whose last crime was committed twenty years ago," Holmes replied. "This plan is far from ideal��"too many uncontrollable variables." He looked at Jeeves and me and a prick of offence scratched my heart as his meaning became clear. I didn't much like the idea of being reduced to an "uncontrollable variable" and Jeeves was as steadfast as they come. But Holmes must not have noticed, for he continued, "But I must work with the tools before me, however inadequate. We either confront Roberson now, on our own terms, or else he'll simply track you down later."

The next few hours passed in punctuations of awkward conversation. A bit after tea, Jeeves and Holmes struck up an exchange about a chap called Hume who appeared to have a lot to do with science or history. I couldn't be sure which. Watson occasionally interjected here and there, but as for me, I confess that before long I found myself too self-conscious to speak up��"a thing that has never happened to me before. It was as if I'd stumbled into the midst of two demiurges who were gabbing about the creation of reality. It was not the sort of thing you wanted to interrupt.

"The relationship between natural law and moral law is, of course, a concern to any man who would study ethics," Holmes said. "If what is natural is not necessarily moral��"in other words, if there is no necessary correlation between the two��"then it would also follow that what is unnatural is not necessarily immoral."

"I quite agree." Jeeves said. "Whereas the laws of nature can be empirically observed and measured and therefore defined according to scientific principles, morality defies quantitative measurement and simple categorization." Jeeves continued. "Have you perused George Moore's Principia Ethica? He presents a similar, though distinct view, and uses the term 'naturalistic fallacy' to describe the logical incohesion of the presumption that moral properties such as 'good' can be defined using natural properties such as 'pleasure'. Although pleasure may be good, goodness cannot be defined as pleasure."

I leaned over to Watson and whispered, so as not to interrupt. "I don't suppose you know what they're on about?"

"Ethical non-naturalism, I think. I confess they're becoming a bit difficult to follow at times."

"Ah. Yes. Yes, a bit." I resumed my silent vigil. Before long, their words flowed together like bits of chocolate all melted into a gooey lump on a hot day. I watched Jeeves's bright and animated eyes and let the sound of his smooth voice wash over me.

It was well past nine o'clock before events started picking up again. At the first rap on the door, we all quickly assumed our assigned positions: Watson and Holmes hidden, me standing well out of the way near the dining room, and Jeeves to the front door to let the fellow in.

"Mr. Marcus Roberson here to see you, sir." Jeeves presented me with the man's card.

"How do you do, Mr. Wooster?"

He was not at all what I expected. I had hoped for some Moriarty-esque nemesis, with a high, domed head and flat, snake-like eyes. Instead, I saw a well-dressed gentleman with a weathered, worldly sort of face and friendly smile. I hadn't had a good look at him before, being face-down on the pavement during much of our first encounter, and I was surprised to find that he looked like the sort of man with whom I could imagine myself playing a cordial round or two of cards at one of the more fashionable London clubs.

"How do you do, Mr. Roberson?" I instinctively stepped forward to shake his outstretched hand.

"I am terribly sorry about my lack of manners this morning," he said, clapping me on the shoulder. "Knocking you over like that and then not even sparing a moment to see if you were all right."

"Oh, think nothing of it. I am, as you see, perfectly recovered from the ordeal."

Roberson laughed. "Pity our parcels didn't fare so well. It seems that I ended up with yours and you walked off with mine."

"Yes, there is that."

"I should like my parcel back." Something about his face shifted; his genial smile, though he had not twitched a muscle, seemed to turn into a leer. My blood chilled at the sight and my brain froze.

"Your parcel?"

"Parcel. The one I dropped. The one you carried home with you."

"Oh, yes, yes of course, that parcel," I laughed nervously. I couldn't think of what to say. All the instructions given to me had been sucked out of my head by this man's fierce stare. "The parcel…"

In the next second, his sinister aspect vanished entirely and he was all bonhomie again and I was left wondering if the whole thing was just my imagination running away with me. "It's a collection of some of my grandmother's old letters, you see. I have a friend at The Daily Mail who's writing up a little article about reminiscences of the last century. I was just going to throw the damned things away but he thought they might help him write his piece. He'd be terribly disappointed if I don't get them to him by his deadline. He's-"

Things all happened so quickly then that I can't be sure that I have all the details, but I'll try my best to relate each event in order. We were all getting along in a gentlemanly fashion, and I had high hopes that once the trap was sprung, Roberson would be an agreeable chap and say, "Well, dash it all, you got me fair and square, so I may as well give myself up." Needless to say, nothing of the sort occurred. On the contrary, in mid-sentence and for no reason I could surmise, he drew a gun. I say he drew it, because I assume he must have. I myself didn't see it despite the fact that I was looking right at him. One second his hands were empty, the next he had a revolver raised, cocked, and aimed at me, ready to fire.

Watson rose from his hiding place then, his own service revolver out. Roberson shifted his aim to meet this new threat and a tremendous bang resounded through the apartment.

"John!" Holmes cried out, vaulting over the chesterfield.

I looked around in confusion. Jeeves was grappling with Roberson, grasping the wrist attached to the hand that wielded the gun, and pushing with all his might to keep it directed safely up and to the side and not pointed at him or any other person. Without a moment's thought or hesitation, I leapt into the fray to save Jeeves from his precarious position.

There was a tangle of limbs and the next thing I knew, Roberson was holding me in front of himself, one arm across my throat in a chokingly tight grip, and the other tucked behind my back. The hard, round barrel of his revolver pressed against my ribs.

"Don't move or he dies," Roberson hissed.

Jeeves froze, teeth clenched and eyes dark with some indefinable emotion. Holmes, gun out and aimed in my direction, was hovering over Watson, who was crumpled on the ground with blood washing over the side of his face. All of us were prisoners in this dreadful tableau until Roberson said otherwise.

"Drop the gun, Mr. Holmes. You wouldn't want to accidentally shoot Mr. Wooster, now would you?"

For a moment, I thought that he would refuse and that I would end up in the very unfortunate position of being caught between two armed and angry men, but at last, Holmes tossed his revolver to the ground.

"You," Roberson cocked his head at Jeeves, who had shifted his weight forward, "Not another step closer, you hear me? Or I will kill him." He dug the gun deeper into my side and I let out a gasp. Jeeves, his eyes locked on mine, said nothing but did not move further.

"Jeeves," I whimpered.

"Don't be afraid, sir," Jeeves murmured to me.

"Afraid? Who's afraid?" I said, boldly, realizing from the quaver in my voice that I was shaking. Roberson's arm tightened against my throat and I was drawn backwards towards the door. Roberson spoke as we retreated.

"If the police come, tell them that the sound the neighbours heard must have been the popping of a champagne cork," he sneered. "If you tell the police anything, if they get involved in any way, I shall know, and I shall put a bullet in Mr. Wooster's diminutive brain. If you behave, you might be able to get Mr. Wooster back alive. I'll contact you in two hours to let you know how."

With those final words, Roberson opened the door and we backed into the hallway. The door closed in front of me, leaving us on one side and Jeeves and the rest on the other. My last vision was of Jeeves, his chiselled jaw set in fierce determination, and it burned itself into my mind.
