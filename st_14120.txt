I don't think I've ever made a soundtrack that I love as much as this one. It's actually my favorite part of this fic! *g* I was amazed I was able to find so many songs that fit the mood of the fic so well and seemed to have lyrics perfectly matched to the plot and the characters. I eventually had to pare it down to the 22 songs that I could more-or-less tie directly to scenes from the movie, so what I ended up with was a soundtrack that essentially tells the story for me in song form. I've listed below the songs and which scene, to me, they tie most closely to, but obviously this is open to personal interpretation. XD

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS FOR THE FIC.

Affirmation (Savage Garden)
I believe in Karma, what you give is what you get returned. I believe you can't appreciate real love 'till you've been burned.
The moment I heard this, I knew it was Merlin's theme song. In my mind, this is played over the opening credit rapid-fire montage of Merlin getting ready and going to work and making coffee and manning picket lines and generally acting like his adorkable self.

All You Need Is Love (Lynden David Hall)
No one you can save that can't be saved. Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time.
If 'Affirmation' was Merlin's theme song, then this is Arthur's. He thinks he's got it all: good looks, money, power, but there's one thing he's missing, and that's the love of an adorkable activist to help him find his destiny and become the man he was always meant to be. And destiny is about to be foisted upon him whether he likes it or not.

Womanizer (Britney Spears)
You got the swagger of champion. Too bad for you, just can't find the right companion. I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard.
My shallow tribute to the revolving door on Arthur's bedroom.

Life Less Ordinary (Carbon Leaf)
That night you came into my life, well it took the bones of me. You blew away my storm and strife, and you shook the bones of me.
When these boys first meet, they don't quite know what's in store for them. All they know is that this other person shakes up their world in a way that promises things will never be the same again. The fact that the gist of the lyrics seems to foreshadow the pain and happiness they'll be facing down the road as well as how their world will end up revolving around each other is just a bonus.

True To Your Heart (Raven)
Baby I knew at once that you were meant for me, deep in my soul I know that I'm your destiny.
Merlin's constant struggle to get Arthur to see that he can be a great man who does great things, if he'll just try and trust that Merlin will be there to help him, always. 

First Kiss (International Five)
Our first kiss won't be the last, our love's too deep to end that fast, and good things come to those who have to wait.
Arthur thinks their first kiss on the rooftop should also be their last and seeks to put an end to their friendship, but instead it makes him start to realize his own feelings for Merlin.

Walk Away (Kelly Clarkson)
You need to know this situation's getting old, and now the more you talk the less I can take.
Merlin is getting really damn sick of Arthur's extra-prattish behavior.

You're So Vain (Suzanne Isaac)
You're so vain, I'll bet you think this song is about you, don't you? 
Arthur doesn't realize how badly his behavior is hurting Merlin, and how close he is to losing him for good.

Goodbye to You (Michelle Branch)
Of all the things I've believed in, I just want to get it over with.
Merlin finally decides he's had enough. He doesn't want to quit, he still loves Arthur and still believes in him, but he's sick of trying.

When You're Gone (Avril Lavigne)
When you're gone, the pieces of my heart are missing you.
Arthur finally realizes that he's about to lose the best thing that's ever happened to him.

You & Me Song (The Wannadies)
Always when we fight I kiss you once or twice and everything's forgotten. I know you hate that.
Arthur and Merlin make up, and it seems that there's hope on the horizon.

Big Yellow Taxi (Counting Crows and Vanessa Carlton)
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you got 'till it's gone?
Just when Arthur was beginning to hope that he and Merlin will weather this storm, Uther swoops in and takes that hope away.

The Nearness of You (Norah Jones)
If you'll only grant me the right to hold you ever so tight, and to feel in the night the nearness of you.
This is the song that was playing during the benefit scene in the movie, when their eyes lock across the crowd, so I like to imagine the same song playing when Arthur first sees Merlin at the medieval charity ball.

Somebody More Like You (Nickel Creek)
I didn't hear you say you're sorry. The fault must be mine.
When Merlin finds out about Arthur backing out of the land donation, he feels betrayed and resentful. Arthur feels much the same when he sees Merlin on the roof with Will.

I'm Still Breathing (Katy Perry)
Let's close this chapter, say one last prayer, but don't say that you loved me.
The boys miss each other terribly, but they are both still hurt and angry, and neither holds out much hope for a reconciliation.

I Hate Myself for Losing You (Kelly Clarkson)
What do you do when you look in the mirror, and staring at you is why he's not here?
They both feel guilty, knowing they've screwed up and hurt each other and driven each other away.

What I Want (Daughtry)
As days go by, I've finally become what you want me to be. 
Remembering Merlin's parting words, Arthur finally decides to be the person Merlin always seemed to believe he could be.

Everlasting Friend (Blue October)
I might crumble, I might take a fall again. I just want to know that you'll be coming home.
Arthur apologizes, hoping to mend things with Merlin. Things still aren't perfect, but he's willing to make the effort if Merlin is, too.

Dizzy (Jimmy Eat World)
If there's half a chance in this moment, when your eyes meet mine, we show it.
Merlin races to Arthur's side, ready to try again. Arthur doesn't exactly welcome him with open arms, at first, and Merlin begins to lose hope.

Rooftops and Invitations (Dashboard Confessional)
Under the cool sheet, where the welcome touch of skin and skin will meet.
Arthur kisses Merlin on the rooftop and they make love for the first time.

The Way I Am (Ingrid Michaelson)
Cuz I love the way you say good morning, and you take me the way I am.
The boys are totally in love and totally devoted to each other, flaws and all.

Walking on Sunshine (Jump5)
I used to think maybe you loved me, now baby I'm sure.
A nice summary song of where they've been and how they live happily ever after. Roll credits. ♥
