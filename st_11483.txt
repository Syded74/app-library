Monday Morning

Two very sore men arrived at work, together, on Monday morning. Tosh and Gwen exchanged glances, Gwen following Ianto to his office. He winced as he sat.

“Good weekend then, boss?” Gwen laughed at Ianto’s glower.

“Is Owen in yet?” Ianto queried. “He wasn’t in the Tourist Office.” Gwen ignored the question, sitting herself on the edge on Ianto’s desk.

“So, I take it you and Jack’s date went well?” Gwen smiled, as Ianto started to blush. “That good, eh? Come on, spill the beans... ”

“Speaking of beans, I could murder a coffee.” Ianto peered out of his office. “Which brings me back to my original question. Is Owen in?” He fixed Gwen with his piercing blue eyes. She shook her head.

“Sorry, Ianto. I haven’t seen him.”

“When you do, tell him I want to see him.” Ianto picked up his pile of paperwork. “Oh, and that I want coffee. And, Gwen how was your weekend?”

Gwen batted his arm, leaving him to his paperwork. Instead of returning to her workstation, Gwen headed for the archives. She found Jack in “C”.

“So, Jack. Good weekend?”

“Fine. How about you?” This did not satisfy Gwen’s curiosity.

“Yeah, it was good.” She wandered round his desk, glancing at artefacts. “How did your date go?”

“Does Ianto know you’re down here asking question?” Gwen flushed, hastily heading back upstairs. A cup of coffee waited on her desk. She looked round, not seeing Owen, but did see Ianto heading to the archives, coffee in hand. Smiling, Gwen switched her pc to the CCTV feed of the archives.

Ianto placed the coffee on Jack’s desk, easing into the spare seat. Smiling, Jack slid the file into place, before sitting. He sipped his coffee.

“Not Owen’s,” he commented.

“No. He’s not in yet.”

“So, who made this?”

Ianto smirked. “I did.”

“You did!” Jack exclaimed.

“You don’t need to sound so surprised. Who do you think trained Owen?”

“Ah. Fair point.” Jack locked eyes with Ianto. “Still sore?”

Ianto laughed. “Only when I move!”

Jack turned serious. “I was wondering... wouldyouliketogooutagain,” he blurted. “Only if you want to.”

“I’d love to.” Ianto’s earpiece chirped – Gwen advising that Owen had arrived. Ianto sighed. “But right now, I’ve got to go and talk to Owen.”
