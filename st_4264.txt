Some girls are moaners, 
    High-pitched and sweet,
Some girls are groaners, 
    Low and discreet.
And some girls mew, 
    Like kittens do, 
    When fingers stroke their fur;
But Amy always giggles 
    When her pussy starts to purr.

The way her button tingles, 
    It makes her grin,
Her pussy soaked and swollen 
    From the wetness within.
She smiles at this, 
    She can't resist; 
    And like a little girl,
Amy giggles at the feeling 
    Flowing from her little pearl.

Amy likes fingers, she likes tongues, 
    She likes cock,
Alone, or one on one, 
    Or with every person on the block,
It's always fun, 
    With more than one, 
    Better than on her own,
And she giggles when the gentlemen shout, 
    And when the ladies moan .

She giggles as she trembles, 
    And her face goes red,
She giggles harder as she quivers, 
    From toes to top of head
Her body shakes! 
    Her body quakes! 
    Her legs raise in the air;
She laughs so loud the neighbors hear, 
    But Amy doesn't care.

Amy is orgasmic, 
    She always comes;
And her lovers smile, 
    When her pussy hums,
Sex with ease, 
    She's not a tease, 
    She spreads legs open wide,
And when the man comes, she giggles and whispers, 
    "I want it inside."

She's coming now, 
    Coming hard,
It's go-time now, 
    For the girl and her bard.
Her body spasms, 
    Orgasms! 
    "More! Give me more!"
And she giggles and giggles, out of control, 
    As her pussy starts to pour.

He's finished,
    But she's still giggling;
He doesn't pull out,
    And she starts wiggling.
"Fuck me more,
    I'm your whore,"
    She whispers in his ear,
And then she giggles as he flips her over
    And fucks her in the rear.

Cocks pump, 
    And fingers twirl;
Amy smiles
    A happy girl.
She puts out,
   Without a doubt,
   With her mouth, her puss, her bum;
And Amy, oh yes Amy giggles,
   She giggles when she comes.
