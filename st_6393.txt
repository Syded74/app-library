CHAPTER 1 - OLD TREASURE

  -  Ok boys, we'll split up into three groups: Josh, Mark, Dani! you'll go search mushrooms near the lake.
  -  Yes, Mr Powell!
  -  Tim, Mike, Mathew! You'll go to the woods to get something to start the   bonfire.
  -  Yes, Mr Powell!
  -  Finally, David, my son...I mean Leo, and I will look for some nuts and berries.
  -  Yes, Mr Powell!

This is my second year with Mr Powell and his horrible son as Scout Leaders. I don't even know why am I here. Oh, yes, right, "trying to make a man out of me", that's what Dad said. Come on! Just because I didn't pass some exams, and do awfully in sports doesn't mean I'm no man, right?

Of, course, there's that thing I've been feeling lately, and that's been bothering me. Since I was little I didn't think too much in sex and such, but hell if I've been horny lately! I saw on TV that this is called puberty? Well, I don't know if that's the name, but it's the weirdest thing ever! My thingy tingles every now and then, and gets all hard at the minor signal of flesh. Then I get sweaty, nervous, something itches me, and I feel like peeing (only that I don't pee at all. How with that stiffy pointing to the ceiling??).

I've been made fun by most of my classmates. The all laugh at me when we enter the showers and call me dirty things. But I know some of them are going through the same! Why don't they help then?

Anyways, here I am, with Dumb and Dumber, looking for berries, under this baking hot sun, and the damn "thingy" itching. Could it get any worse?

  - AAAAAGH!!!!

I fell! For God's sake! We're supposed to be in a plain, how come there's a hole here?

  - Are you ok David?
  - Yes, I think so, Mr Powell. A bit of pain in the butt, but the rest is alright.

I could hear Leo laughing. Damn Bastard!!

  - Ok, boy. Wait there, I'll go get you a rope. You won't want to spend the night there, right?

I sat down in the moist floor. Leo was still up there, I could hear him moving from one place to another. But I wouldn't talk to him.He was such an spoiled brat, with his perfect teeth, in his perfect all american face, and his well built teenage wrestler body. All girls in school, even the older ones, drooled after him. To make it worse, he was even intelligent! What was on God's mind when he created such an Adonis! 

Why don't I like him? Isn't that obvious? One could say I'm rather cute, with my blond hair and green eyes. I'm an OK boy, I guess. But Leo's always been better! Always catching everyone's attention, always so good, so friendly, so smart, that everyone behind him looked like a perfect looser. An Jessica, my beloved Jessica felt in love to him, to this plasticine brat. I'm sure she doesn't even know my name, and I've been in her classes since ever!

I decided to put apart my thoughts and do something more useful. I was in some kind of a cove. The hole I felt in must have been the connection to a series of tunnels, or so it semt by the depth in the darkness that was in front of me. 

I stood up and felt the rough surface of the rocky walls that surrounded me. Some roots managed to make their way under hard ground, which seemed to have taken many years.
I lightened my flashlight, pointed to the dark cave, and decided to do some search.

  - Where do you think you're going?
  - WHAT do you think I'm doing?
  - You don't know what might be inside there! You could even fall further down!
  - So what?
  - Look, Dad's coming in a few minutes and...!

But I was already in my way inside the darkness of the cove. I wasn't going to stay there, listening to some whiny little boy, and less Leo's voice.

It became narrower and narrower with every step. I had to be careful where I put my feet, some stalagmites (or where they stalactites?) stood in the way. I could see all sorts of minerals along with the moist rocks and roots all over the place. The atmosphere became chillier at some point, and my body was showing some shaking.

Just when I was about to turn my way back to the beginning of my expedition, I saw it. Something glistering to the light of my flashlight. Could it be gold?

I approached, slowly, anxious at the thought of becoming rich, rich and powerful, and being able to walk over all of those I considered my most atrocious enemies... And back to reality, I leaned my hand over the bright object. What a waste of energy! It was just one of those crappy pan flutes. It wasn't gold at all!

But giving it a second look, it wasn't that bad at all. It isn't gold, but it was made from some glistening yellow metal. There were beautiful decorations graved all over the tubes, and something written in the middle of the instrument.

"Master of Souls"

  - Cool!! Some other silly kid must have felt in the darn hole, and lost it! Finders Keepers!

I put it in my pocket, and followed my way back to the entrance of the cave.

  - You're back!
  - Of course I am! You think some little cave could beat me?

Leo changed his expression from concern to anger. I know he hates it when people don't care for him.

While the dumb boy wasn't looking, I withdrew my new found treasure. Would it work ok? I look pretty old! There was only one way to know.

I blew through the orifices, and as the air went through, notes where starting to be clear. I wasn't too skilled in music, God knows this was my first time ever playing a pan flute! But it sounded pretty good, and felt wonderful in my lips. I wasn't realizing it yet, but the improvised melody I was playing sounded pretty good. Mild and sweet, like one of those French love songs Jessica listens to so often.

I started thinking about her, about how she smiles while she sticks to her headphones, and how her beautiful sandy hair flows with the air as she walks. And those beautiful long legs of her, shining at the morning sun when she enters the school. And those breasts, aaw! Those breasts of her! With only 14 she was the most developed girl in our class!

And as I was having this dirty thoughts, and playing unconsciously the pan flute, I felt something stirring up in my scout pants. Was I getting a boner from all the situation? I wanted to touch it, I was so hot! Imagining Jess, doing all sort of naughty things, doing them for me..!

Suddenly, a voice reached my ears.

  - Oh, Jess! Aw! Yes! Yes!

Damn bastard!! Wasn't that Leo's voice? What the heck was he doing right now! I stopped playing at once, filled with anger. No one dared to touch my Jessica, even if it was in dreams!!

  - What are you doing up there, you asshole??
  - ... What..?
  - You were masturbating, weren't you, you bullshit?
  - N-No! No way! I was, I was sitting her, waiting for Dad and...!
  - Don't dare to lie! I heard you! All moaning, and, and, talking about Jessica..!
  - No! I mean.. Yes but..! I don't know what came to me! I wasn't! I wasn't..! Oh, Darn it...!

He's voice sounded nervous and sobs made it harder to understand him. 

  - If my Dad gets to know this,  I'm..! I'm...! Please, just don't tell him, alright?

He was in such a shock. Ok, maybe he was overreacting. But truth to be said, it was not like Leo to do dirty stuff in the first place. The whole family was so religious that even the slightest signal of interest in the other genre was an unbearable sin! How come he just masturbated in front of me? And with his dad about to arrive with the rescuing rope.

  - What were you thinking Leo?
  - I-I don't know! It just, happened...!
  - Ok, ok, stop sobbing, will ya? I hate whining bastards. I won't tell to your father, alright? So stop messing, and crying and sobbing, because it's driving me crazy.
  - You won't tell?
 
As much as it hurt me not taking profit from this situation, the boy was having a real bad time. I wasn't that bad after all, right? Besides, I could use it n later occasions.

  - You can trust me, I'm not even interested in talking about sex with your father. Don't even think it.
  - Oh, David! Thanks! Thanks a lot!

I didn't wanted his thanks! I just hated him! Why had he be that good boy? If only he was a less perfect...

The pan flue in my hands started to glow. I looked at it. What a coincidence that while I played the flute and thought about Jessica, this dork was fantasizing about the same things. Leo! The ultra religious!

Could there be any connection?

I saw the inscription again: "Master of Souls". There was something different on it this time. Something little graved and inch under. 

  "D...A...V...I......D"

DAVID?? What the..?? That was me!!

I thought it twice. Was this written when I first found the flute? Could it be the former owner had the same name? What were the odds of that happening? There was a small chance that it could be but, what a coincidence! And then there was the incident that just happened.

I decided to give a try to my twisted thoughts. I had nothing to loose.

I put the holes of the flute touching my lips. I played the first notes, as the same melody came back to the atmosphere. It was so nice, so relaxing. I drawn myself into the melody, while I thought in what I had planned.

I saw Leo, I saw him clearly in my mind. He was standing up, and all of a sudden he was barking, like some filthy dog, and walking on all four, as dogs do.

I looked up, where Leo was suppose to be, and there he was to my astonishment, walking on all fours and happily barking like some happy dog. His face with a look of confusion, but the rest of his body acting just like I imagined.

This was definitely the proof, this could be no coincidence! This was no ordinary flute, there was something special on it. Something magic, something that let people control others will...!

The Stave Master.
