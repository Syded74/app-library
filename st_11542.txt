Chapter 8: Matters of the Heart

Jeeves led Holmes and me to the guestroom with its solitary bed. "I trust this arrangement will be satisfactory, gentlemen?"

I had strongly suspected that Jeeves knew about my relationship with Holmes, although I had not been entirely certain. His question, however, made his suppositions clear, and my answer would confirm their accuracy. "Yes, this is perfectly satisfactory. Thank you, Jeeves."

"Then if you will pardon me, I must return to Mr. Wooster. He has been through quite an ordeal." With that said, Jeeves left us alone. It was our first moment of true privacy since we came to London.

Holmes wasted no time loosening his tie and stripping off his jacket and waistcoat with a careless haste born of peevishness. Despite his obvious irritability, I admired the long, lanky form slowly being revealed. The touch of Venus began to steal over me, but I drove such thoughts from my mind. Holmes needed sleep, whether he admitted it or not, so simply lying by his side again would have to be enough. Before long, Holmes was prepared for bed and enveloped in his dressing gown. Nevertheless, instead of settling under the covers as I hoped he would, he paced up and down the floor.

He paused to light a cigarette, and then resumed his perambulations, saying, "So far, Roberson has had the upper hand in all our encounters. We need to change the balance of power, put him on the defensive."

"Could you forget about Roberson for just a few hours?" I said, removing my collar and cuffs.

His grey eyes, full of reproach, fixed on mine. "So long as Roberson is free, he is a threat. We would be unwise to forget that."

"I understand, but there's nothing you can do about it at two in the morning, and if you don't get some sleep, you won't be fit to do anything about it tomorrow, either. Your eyes are so red you look positively demonic and you're as pale as a ghost."

"A demon and a ghost," Holmes snorted in derisive laughter. "Your gothic sensibilities are in fine form tonight. Next you'll be comparing me to Stoker's Dracula."

"Just lie down, Holmes. Please."

"With the retrieval of Mr. Wooster, the only thing he holds against us are your damned writings. Our strategy must be two-fold. We must find evidence of renewed criminal activity on Roberson's part. If the courts won't give him the noose, at the very least we can see to it that he's locked up for the rest of his life. Furthermore, we must find and destroy the papers to safeguard our own reputations. If we fail in that, well," Holmes smiled, "there's always the option of fleeing to Paris, mais oui?"

"Holmes--"

"I have no doubt at all that he's returned to his old ways. His sort of criminal--remorseless, sadistic--always does. Tomorrow I will make inquiries--"

"Sherlock!" Uncommon as it was for me to address him by his Christian name, surprise stopped him short. At last I had his attention. "For heaven's sake let it be and go to sleep."

His head was cocked as if curiously examining me for the source of my outburst. He blinked a few times before responding. "I do apologize if I am keeping you awake, my dear Watson. My mind is racing still. I have no inclination to rest."

"Your mind may be racing, but your body is exhausted. You'll do yourself harm if you spend yet another night sleepless." I implored as best I could. "Is there anything I can do?"

Holmes did not answer at first, but at least he ceased his wanderings and stood in contemplation. "I need a cup of tea," he said at last.

"The last thing you need right now is a stimulant."

"Then I'll have herbal tea, if Mr. Wooster keeps any. Would that satisfy you?"

"It's an acceptable compromise," I said. Holmes began to stride to the door, but I stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. "Provided that you permit me to take care of the tea while you lie down."

Holmes grimaced, but saw that I was not to be swayed on this. He rolled his eyes and then draped himself across the bed, looking at me expectantly. His gaze, half-petulant, half-daring, tempted me to forget the tea entirely in favour of kissing that expression from his face, but it was my duty as his friend and his doctor to see to it that he rested. I could not allow him to distract me from that goal. He was set on having tea before sleep, and so tea he would have. After that, no more excuses, if I had to tie him to the bed myself.

I wrapped myself in my dressing gown and went in search of Jeeves, hoping he was still awake so he could point me in the direction of the tea leaves. I padded down the hallway, but stopped short when I heard voices. Peering around the corner, I saw Mr. Wooster standing at the door to Jeeves's quarters. I waited where I was so that I would not interrupt, assuming the conversation to be the innocuous and businesslike sort of thing that passes between gentlemen and their menservants.

"...that whenever I'm in the soup, I come to you to help me out," Mr. Wooster was saying. "Well I'm not really in the soup, I suppose, not in the grim matrimony looming on my horizon sense, or even in the cracked relations ordering Bertram to risk his skin for some thick scheme sense, or really in any sense at all. Not necessarily."

Jeeves remained silent and attentive throughout the babble. I admired his patience. Holmes would have given up on the conversation about ten words in, and even I would have been hard pressed not to interrupt and guide Mr. Wooster back to his topic, assuming I could ascertain what his topic was amidst all the chatter.

Mr. Wooster continued. "This trouble is entirely self-inflicted, I'm afraid, and I haven't any idea what to do about it. I would have brought the problem before you sooner, but I didn't dare to. You are a party to it, you see, rather intimately involved, and so I couldn't be sure that your response would be unprejudiced. Recent events, however, have spurred me to action. The situation cannot remain as it is, and you are the only one who can help me. So I lay it before you." He paused there, drawing himself up straight and taking a deep breath. "Do you like me, Jeeves?" Mr. Wooster blurted at last.

"Sir?"

"Do you like me?"

"I find you to be a most agreeable employer, sir," Jeeves replied.

"That's not what I mean."

"Then I'm afraid that you will have to clarify your intent, sir."

Mr. Wooster rocked back and forth on his heels, his gaze darting here and there. "Have you ever experienced the walking-on-air, butterflies-in-the-stomach, fire-and-ice feeling of love, Jeeves? Has your brilliant mind ever been turned to mush by the mysterious workings of the heart?"

"I have experienced a certain amount of romance in my time, sir" Jeeves answered cautiously.

"I'm not speaking of romance," Mr. Wooster said. "Flowers and walks in the garden and the other acts that men are obligated to perform with a girl they may or may not wish to be engaged to. I'm speaking of that feeling that you get when you think it isn't possible to live a happy life without a certain, special someone sharing it, and every time you think of that c. s. s. your heart gives a tug, and every time you see him...uh...or her...whichever, depending on the focus of regard for the individual in question...Where was I? Oh yes, every time you see your heart's delight you feel a little shiver go down your spine."

Mr. Wooster waited anxiously for Jeeves's answer. I, too, found myself holding my breath in anticipation. I admit to possessing a strong appreciation for the romantic, and even more, I thought Mr. Wooster a kind-hearted soul who deserved to find happiness.

Finally, Jeeves put an end to Mr. Wooster's suspense. "My lips are stricken to silence, underneath my skin the tenuous flame suffuses; nothing shows in front of my eyes, my ears are muted in thunder, and the sweat breaks running upon me, fever shakes my body, paler I turn than grass."

Eyes wide with shock, Mr. Wooster said feebly, "Yes, that's the one."

"It was written in the sixth century BC by the Greek poetess, Sappho."

"This curse has been plaguing people for that long?"

"It appears to be a fundamental aspect of the human condition, sir," Jeeves said.

"Then Sappho and I have something in common, for that's just the way I feel about--"

"You would be wise to refrain from completing the declaration that I believe you are about to articulate, sir."

Mr. Wooster, rattled by the interruption, mouthed Jeeves's words to himself, translating their meaning. I, too, was surprised by Jeeves's reaction. Hitherto, I had witnessed nothing but the utmost care and attachment in Jeeves's treatment of Mr. Wooster, and the careful observer could detect a certain appreciative spark in Jeeves's eyes when they alit on Mr. Wooster's form.

"Are you saying that I don't inspire...That is, that you don't feel...dash it all!"

Jeeves was silent, his gaze turned towards the floor.

Mr. Wooster's dejected countenance lightened. "You're not denying it, Jeeves. Jeeves?"

Jeeves's broad shoulders rose and fell with his breath. "I am not denying it."

"That's marvellous!" Mr. Wooster grinned.

"On the contrary, sir. It changes nothing."

"You mean, you won't return my affections, freely offered?"

"It would be most inadvisable, sir."

"Why is that?" Mr. Wooster's brow wrinkled in confusion. "I fancy you, you fancy me. What's the hang up?"

"If I may be so bold to say, sir, you are inconstant by nature. What fascinates you one week is forgotten the next. This is not always an unfavourable quality, as it makes it all the simpler to dissuade you from assorted unwise courses of action, but when it comes to my own person, and my livelihood, I prefer not to take the risk."

"Let me get this straight. You're turning me down, giving me the boot, sending me off, crushing this young lover's hopes and asp…asper…asper-somthings under your ruthless heel because you don't trust me?"

"I would not state it thus, but, yes, sir, you are correct in the essentials."

"But…but that's just not on! I love you, Jeeves."

"You love me now."

"And forever," Mr. Wooster retorted. "Jeeves, I don't know how I can prove it to you. If you were a girl, I'd offer to marry you, to shackle ourselves together 'til death do us part, and to hell with anyone who disapproved on account of your station. What I'm saying is that if I could, I'd re-enact that Rosie M. Banks novel with you-you know, the one where the rich young man falls madly in love, woos, and eventually weds the penniless maid."

"Perhaps you are referring to 'Love Unconquered'."

"That might have been the one."

"Or perhaps 'A Fair Lady's Maid' or 'Upstairs, Downstairs' or 'Only for Love'. They all share similar characteristics in plot and structure."

"Yes, yes, yes, it was one of those. It hardly matters which one. The point is, Jeeves, I'd propose to you if I could, and unlike my previous engagements, I wouldn't even ask you to help me get out of it. I'd delight in the prospect of being bound to you in sickness and in health, for richer and poorer and all that. What can I do to convince you that the Wooster heart will be true?"

"I really couldn't say, sir."

"You must realize what a rummy situation this has become. At long last I discover that my pash for you is returned, and yet even as the Lord giveth, he taketh away." Mr. Wooster's eyes were wide with sorrow, and misery sat upon his every feature. "I'll willingly give up my cobalt blue hat for you," he said desperately.

"Although the gesture is appreciated, sir, a hat, no matter how garish, is not of sufficient value to exchange for a heart."

"I'll give up the Aston, then, although we'll have a devil of a time getting to Brinkley Court to visit Aunt Dahlia without the Aston."

Jeeves stiffened. "Monetary value is not what I alluding to, sir."

"I'm sorry. I've made a hash of things." Shoulders slumped and eyes blinking rapidly, Mr. Wooster said, "I suppose I should go now before I make things even worse. I won't-" His words were punctuated by a quiet sniffle, which he tried to disguise as a cough. "I won't bother you again."

Mr. Wooster turned to slink away, morose as dog pining for his owner. He therefore did not see the indecision and longing that crumpled Jeeves's features. It was the most unguarded and despairing expression I had ever seen on the man's usually inscrutable face. I feared that they were both about to make a tragic mistake: Mr. Wooster by conceding defeat so quickly and Jeeves by letting his excessive caution deny him what he desired. Mr. Wooster had not taken one step, however, when Jeeves stopped him with a hand on Mr. Wooster's shoulder. Mr. Wooster stared, dumbfounded, at the restraining hand. Slowly, he was drawn in towards Jeeves until the two were pressed against each other. Mr. Wooster blinked up in Jeeves's face in adoring wonder as Jeeves lowered his head and captured his employer's lips in a gentle kiss. Mr. Wooster closed his eyes and wrapped his arms around Jeeves's neck, while Jeeves in turn wound one hand in Mr. Wooster's hair and let the other fall to his waist. When the kiss ended, they remained wrapped around each other like ribbons around a May pole.

Neither spoke for many seconds. At last, Mr. Wooster broke the silence. "Not that I'm objecting, but I though you said I was unreliable."

"I did. Reason and caution, however, appear to have deserted me." Jeeves's reply was almost too soft for me to hear.

Mr. Wooster nodded. "Another side-effect of the malady."

"Indeed, sir."

Mr. Wooster pulled Jeeves's head down for another kiss, longer, but as gentle as the first, tentative and unsure. When they parted again, Mr. Wooster asked, "So, you're willing to give it a try?"

"Against my better judgment, but yes."

The next kiss was firmer, more passionate. The fabric of Mr. Wooster's pyjamas crumpled under Jeeves's fist. It was many moments before they broke the kiss, breathing heavily. Jeeves smoothed his hand over Mr. Wooster back, as if to wipe away the wrinkles he'd caused. In unison, they stepped towards the open doorway to Jeeves's room.

Mr. Wooster murmured, "I will never tire of you, Jeeves. You'll see."

Their lips met again as they vanished beyond the doorframe. Moments later the door closed. I smiled to myself and made my way to the kitchen. I had overheard enough, more than enough, to know that the last thing they would appreciate was an interruption. I would just have to find my way about the kitchen without Jeeves's guidance.

As I found the kettle and put it on the stove, I wondered whether I ought not to feel guiltier about my eavesdropping. Perhaps my years with Holmes had dulled my good manners, but I felt nothing but soft joy. They were both so young and innocent, even Jeeves for all his calm and worldly intelligence, with a seemingly infinite lifetime of limitless possibilities stretching out before them.

The tea was tucked away out of sight and took some minutes to find. To my relief there was an herbal blend, grassy, the sort of thing one might drink while recovering from a cold, but it would have to do. Once the water came to a boil, I strained the tea and prepared two cups��"-one with a dash of milk and two sugars, the other milky and sickeningly sweet, as Holmes preferred it, having used it as a substitute for a meal too many times.

Thinking upon the scene I'd witnessed, I hoped that all would end well for the two, despite Jeeves's reservations. There were few things on God's earth more uplifting than two souls finding happiness in each other. To my eyes they seemed well-suited for each other regardless of their differences in class and temperament, and deeply enamoured of each other's company. With such thoughts on my mind, I returned to the guest room bearing two cups of tea and a gentle smile.

Holmes noticed my mood immediately. "What is the matter with you?" he asked, accepting the cup and saucer I handed to him.

"Nothing's the matter. Nothing at all. I was merely pleased to see Mr. Wooster and Jeeves getting along well."

He scoffed. My light mood immediately sank under the weight of his scorn, and I found anger rising in its place. It was too much to hope that Holmes might appreciate a touch of romance as much as I. The only time he ever openly expressed anything akin to love was when under disguise as a deceit to further one of his investigations.

The development of our relationship had consisted simply of one unexpected action happening after another. There were never any discussions, declarations, or promises about the matter. Most of the time, one day bled into the next and I hardly thought about it outside my rare melancholy moments. Now, however, touched by what I'd seen, I was keenly feeling the lack of any sort of verbal affirmation that I meant more to Holmes than any of his other familiar possessions, like his clay pipe or his violin.

"Holmes," I said, pausing to drink from my cup. "Have you ever wished you were able to marry?"

"Marry? What on earth has caused you to speculate that I would ever want to? I have always made my feelings regarding women perfectly clear."

"I don't mean a woman-"

"Law and custom are rather precise about the criteria on that score."

"Law and custom be hanged!" I snarled. "That's not what I'm talking about."

Holmes took a sip of his herbal tea and grimaced in disgust. "Marriage as an institution, whether in the real or the theoretical, has never interested me."

"Sherlock," I said. "You know how I feel, you know that I lo-"

Holmes spat a mouthful of tea back into his cup. "This tea is terrible." He rose from the bed, ignoring my protestations, and snatched up his dressing gown, declaring his intention to make a new cup. I followed him out the door.

"Holmes, for God's sake, this is ridiculous," I hissed. In the kitchen, Holmes began slamming cupboards and rattling pots, rifling around as loud as possible, it seemed, presumably to drown out my words. "Holmes-"

"Where is the...Ah-ha!" He dropped the kettle onto the countertop with a clatter. More ruckus followed as Holmes proceeded to tear apart the kitchen. I winced to imagine what Jeeves would think when saw it in the morning.

He dumped the remains of the herbal tea into the sink and rinsed out the teapot, the sound of running water crashing in the basin. More banging and ransacking followed. It was a bit like watching a windstorm devastate the room, leaving a tremendous mess of strewn dishes in its wake.

"Holmes, what are you looking for now?"

"The blasted tea. It must be around here somewhere."

I was about to point him in the proper direction when the kitchen door burst open and Jeeves stalked in, wrapped in a teal dressing gown, his hair wild. "Is there a problem, gentlemen?" he said in icy tones.

"No. No problem," Holmes replied.

"Holmes was making tea," I elaborated.

Jeeves crossed to the pantry in which the tea was kept, and plucked out a bag of tealeaves. "Here is some tea." He placed the bag firmly on the counter. Next he filled the kettle with water and set it on the stove. "Here is the kettle." A clean teapot and two cups came from the cupboard and a tea strainer from a cutlery drawer. "Here is the teapot, the cups, and the strainer." He continued, "Here is the milk." He fetched milk from the icebox. "And here is the sugar. Is there anything else I can assist you gentlemen with?"

I had a strong suspicion that if we were to answer anything but "no," we would shortly find ourselves tossed out on our ears. "I think we can manage," I said.

"Very good." Before Jeeves left, he looked directly at Holmes and said, "Whatever psychological agitation is upon you, I heartily request that you resolve it, preferably with minimal noise."

Jeeves departed, and Holmes and I remained in silence. Holmes boiled the water and strained the tea while I looked on without saying a word. I was by no means finished, however. Our conversation would resume once we returned to our room. I refused a fresh cup of tea, unwilling to condone Holmes's obvious prevarication. With a new cup in hand, he returned to the guest room, while I trailed behind. He set the cup on the nightstand without taking a sip. I sat on the edge of the bed and heaved a sigh.

"Your pretence with the tea was a pretty poor diversion--utterly transparent." Holmes was silent. I continued, "Holmes, for heaven's sake, we've known each other for nearly four decades. Are we ever going to talk frankly about this?"

"Talk about what?"

"You know very well what," I replied.

"I'm afraid I don't, as I can think of nothing between us that requires discussion and I despise pointless natter."

"It does require discussion, whether you think so or not. Holmes, I need to know what you feel."

"Feel," he spat the word out as if it were laced with strychnine.

"Yes, feel. I know you do have emotions, although you do your damnedest to suffocate them."

Holmes narrowed his eyes. "Why now, after all this time? Where did this come from?"

I thought of the tender words exchanged between young Mr. Wooster and his devoted manservant. I didn't doubt that Holmes had deduced the situation between them from the moment he first laid eyes on them, but I was still reluctant to reveal what I had overheard. It was a private moment and not mine to share, especially not with Holmes, who, given the mood he was in, would likely corrode my memory of the affectionate scene with his biting cynicism. "It doesn't matter where it came from. Can you not simply answer? What am I to you? A lover? A companion? A convenience? A bad habit you haven't yet bothered to break? I don't know; you certainly never say."

"Why would I bother to state what ought to be self-evident?"

"Why would you--" I sputtered. "Any sane man would have quit your company long ago."

"That doesn't speak highly of your own mental faculties."

My jaw clenched and I ground out, "This is exactly what I'm talking about. You have all the heart and sensitivity of a machine. I'm not asking you to go on bended knee to declare undying adoration, but just a word, now and again. Leave me with something more than guesses based on your erratic actions. There are enough mysteries in my life; I don't need my place in your world to be one of them. I--"

Before I could get another word out, Holmes seized my hair and pulled me into a violent kiss, open mouthed, sloppy, tongue writhing against my teeth. It was so sudden, so unexpected that it broke my train of thought entirely, and I initially had not the presence of mind either to object or reciprocate. When my scattered thoughts returned, I turned my face away, ending our embrace with a wet smack.

"Holmes, what--"

"Shhhh." His thumb blocked any further words that might have issued from me. I turned away again.

"Holmes, stop it, I'm trying to talk to you. This--" The return of his lips to mine swallowed my protests and his hand, trailing lower and lower down my chest drove them from my mind entirely. I gave in and leaned back into the mattress, drawing Holmes down on top of me.

The years had taken away the urgency of youth, but Holmes's white hands and thin lips never failed to excite passion in me. He pushed my nightshirt up, straddled my hips and began rocking against me, still enwrapped in his own dressing gown. His fingers traced the lines on my chest where the muscle insertions lay under skin and flesh. From any other man, the gesture would seem distant and clinical, but from Holmes, who approached every opportunity for observation with focus and inhuman intensity, it was superb. I slipped my hands past the folds of his dressing gown and caressed the sides of his whippet-thin torso, each ridge of sinew and bone tangible through the fabric of his nightshirt. It was so rare for him to initiate carnal acts that I was compelled to try to speak through my growing desire.

"What is--what is this about?"

Holmes chuckled. "I should have thought it was obvious." As if to demonstrate, he leaned down and licked the edge of my jaw. The air whisking the wetness away was cool on my flushed skin.

His rhythmic rocking continuing against my hips was becoming magnificently intolerable, a promise needing fulfilment. I picked at the knot of his dressing robe with trembling hands, keen to uncover the flesh beneath. I got no further than undoing the belt when Holmes drew away and rose from the bed. A sound of dismay escaped my lips and I sat up to observe his actions, ready to lunge for him and pin him down if needs be if he went to the kitchen for some more blasted tea.

He must have read my thoughts on my expression, for he smirked and said, "Patience. Good things come to those who wait."

I need not have worried, however, for he went no farther than his portmanteau from which he retrieved a few items��"pomade grease, handkerchiefs, and, to my confusion, a book of matches. All these he placed on the nightstand. He swiftly divested himself of dressing gown and nightshirt, leaving them in an untidy pile on the floor. I thought to follow his example, but before I could do more than raise the hem to my shoulders Holmes was once again astride me, pushing me supine, snatching my wrists and pulling my arms over my head.

"Stay there," he whispered in my ear, squeezing my wrists once in monition before sliding his hands down my arms. Obedient to his whim, I left my arms where he'd placed them, although my fingers twitched with the instinct to grasp, to hold, to embrace.

Holmes popped the cap off the pomade and dipped his fingers into the sticky substance. When he touched me, I gasped at the shock of the cold pomade on my overheated flesh and arched and shuddered as the chill ran through me. Holmes sighed at that, the first sign, beyond the grossly physical, that he was as deeply affected as I was.

He shuffled forward, and then, reaching behind him to hold me in place, slowly settled down until I was entirely sheathed within his body. We paused there, unmoving, waiting. My heartbeat throbbed in my throat and I wanted desperately to reach out to him��"the muscles in my arms jumped and flexed with the impulse--but I refrained, obeying Holmes's command.

The matchbook was next to come to his hands. He struck a match and, leaning low over me, held it in the few inches of space that separated us. The tiny flame cast sinister shadows over his face and sparkled in the depths of his grey eyes. The edge of a frown puckered my brow. I trusted Holmes and knew that he was no sadist, but his impulsiveness could be disquieting, and his love of the grotesque sometimes led him in directions I had never imagined.

To my relief, he pursed his lips and blew the flame out. The puff of his breath and the sulphurous smoke washed over my face. Bowing his head, Holmes rested his cheek on mine, his nose buried in my throat, and inhaled deeply.

"The smell of match smoke is so unlike that of natural wood," he murmured.

"Just don't set fire to the bed," I said in resignation. Holmes was the most sensual man I had ever known--in the most literal meaning of the word. He took extraordinary delight in engaging his senses in unpredictable ways. As this worked to my advantage more often than not, I never attempted to curb his idiosyncrasy.

I felt his smile in the way his cheek rounded against mine. He flexed his thighs, rising then sinking over me. I groaned at the sensation and thrust up in turn. Soon, we fell into a steady rhythm. Holmes grasped my hands and placed them on his body, an unspoken signal that I was now free to move as I wished. Overcome by my newfound liberty, I could hardly decide where to touch--first his face, stroking my thumbs over his sharp cheeks; then his back, exploring the curve of his spine, the bone of each vertebra and the dip above his buttocks; then his legs, squeezing encouragement with each contraction of his muscle.

Every few minutes he would maddeningly cease, lay a hand on my hipbone to stop my own thrusts, light another match, blow it out, and indulge in the scent. After the fourth such time, I snatched the matchbook from his hands and threw it at the door. Forestalling any protest that might ensue, I pulled him down into a kiss, grasping him by the hair with one hand and reaching between us to stroke him with the other.

Unhindered by interruptions, he rode me ferociously, until we were both panting and sweating. Minutes later, his rhythm staggered, fell, his fingers clenched on my shoulders hard enough to be painful and he pulsed out his release, gasping and whimpering with sensation. I wrapped my arms around his back and held him close, thrusting up in desperate bursts until I, too, lost myself in his embrace. My vision darkened and I knew nothing but the warmth of his body on and around me and the sharp scent of sweat and pomade.

We lay entwined for a moment, breath and heartbeat coming down from the celerity to which they were raised. When Holmes rolled off me I immediately came over in goose bumps from the chill of the air after Holmes's warmth. He offered me a few handkerchiefs, retrieved from the nightstand and I wiped away the worst of the mess. Holmes buried himself under the blankets without a word and curled on his side away from me, at last chasing sleep. It was only later as I lay gazing at the dark ceiling, that I realized that Holmes had once again avoided saying anything meaningful.
