Come with me,
   my little love,
For a walk out in the snow;
The sky is thick with falling flakes,
The sight of it, such merry makes!
   The snow our stocking caps will coat,
   On little one, your man will dote!

Come with me,
   my little love,
To a pristine frozen park:
Heavenly girl and man lie down,
Snow angels make on icy ground!
   Two loving angels, wings spread wide,
   Man and cherub, side by side.

Come with me,
   my little love,
We'll make a handsome snowman!
With carrot nose and charcoal eyes,
Old top hat and smile wise.
   But snowman's lonely, he has no mate!
   So next, snowlady we create!

Come with me,
   my little love,
For a special snowtime thrill,
We'll run and jump and laugh and ride,
Down snowy hill we'll slip and slide.
   Then drag our sleds back to the top,
   Snowbunny never wants to stop!

Yes, come with me,
   my little love,
This wintertime starlit night.
We'll trudge through snow,
Then home we'll go,
To cocoa mugs and firelight,
To blankets warm and snuggles tight!
Then arms entangled, hearts a-beat,
Beneath the covers, lovers meet.
Daddy strong and kitten sweet,
Together make our love complete.
