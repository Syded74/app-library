Patience paced across her livingroom.    Jonathan had just informed her that Gracie had fled.   She couldnt believe that her sister had run from Rand.    Her sister was fearless.   She had always dared to tread where no woman had gone before.   

I cant believe she ran.   How are we suppose to help Rand with her if she has left?   Patience asked as she continued to pace furiously.

Sweetheart, calm down.   Jonathan said soothingly.  

How can you be calm about this.    Shes gonna bring disaster down upon my mother and father.   This is not a small slight.   An advisors daughter does not turn down marriage to the crown prince.   It just isnt done.   Gracie is lucky that Rand has chosen her.  He could have chosen any other witch.   She said hotly.

Yes he could have.  Gracie said quietly.  And for the record, Patience I told him to chose another.   Patience and Jonathan spun around to see Grace standing in the doorway.   When Jonathan reached for the com unit strapped to his waist, Grace frowned.

I wouldnt do that Jonathan.  Grace said more calmly than she felt.   Youll force my hand. You are not going to call him.   

Who do you think Im going to call, Gracie?  Jonathan asked cautiously.

Your best friend. Grace said evenly.  And I wont allow that.

Hes your best friend too, Gracie.   Dont forget that.  Dont ever forget that.  Jonathan replied.

I havent Jonathan.  But he has.  He wants more.   But I have no more to give.  Grace said still watching Jonathans hand.  She just knew he was going to try and alert Rand.  It was just a matter of timing.  

You know I have to let him know, Gracie.    He has that right.  Jonathan coaxed.  He has bond with you, Gracie.  There will be no other for him.  You know how that works.

Then hell just have to unbind himself.  Grace said still watching him.   Jonathan was torn between alerting Rand via the com unit or simply sending it to him telepathically.   He didnt use the telepathic link often.  He was a little rusty.   Grace watched the wheels turning in Jonathans head.   He was going to alert Rand but it wouldnt be by his com unit she realized.  He was going to use another path.

Groaning she whispered an apology before she attacked.   Jonathan was totally unprepared for Gracie to attack him.   If anyone had ever asked him, he would have swore that Gracie would never hurt him.   He was at a disadvantage, he didnt want to hurt her.  Rand would never forgive him if he did.   Because of this he was taken completely off guard when Gracie kicked his knee cap and shattered it.   It had the desired effect.   It took him off balance and down to Gracie height.   Then she clipped him on the chin.  Just before he blacked out he managed to send a fragment of a thought to Rand.  
 Shes here 

Patience screamed as she watched Jonathan fall.   Turning towards her sister Grace sighed.  

Patience, calm down.   Hell be fine. 

I cant believe that you just did that.  What ever possessed you to do that?

I told him not to Patience.  I warned him.  You heard me.  Grace said tiredly.   Came by to tell you that Im leaving.   I wanted you to hear it personally from me.  But as usual you and Jonathan are thicker than thieves.   Hes a wonderful man, sis.  Dont let him get away.   I wish you two the utmost happiness.   Then she steeled herself.  Good night, Patience.   Gracie said as she cast a sleeping spell over her little sister.

Time was of the utmost essence here.  She knew that Jonathan had sent out his call to Rand and she was sure that he was on his way.  But first she had one more spell to cast before she left.  It only took a few moments to perform the healing spell.   Patience deserved a whole and fit husband.  Not one with a limp.  Then she disappeared.

**************************************************************************************

Rand stormed into Patiences house.   In the livingroom he found both of them sitting on the couch holding their heads.   

Im sorry Rand.  I tried to stop her.   Looking at his best friend he saw that Jonathan had a bruise running down the length of his jaw.   Gracie, you sure did a number on my best friend.   Damn woman I love that feisty side of yours. Just remember, sweetheart, your time is limited.  Run as far and fast as you can.   Youll only end up running right back to me.   When he didnt get an answer he wasnt surprised.   

You okay?  He asked Jonathan.  

Damn, do I have a headache.  Jonathan replied.   My knee aches too.  But she didnt break it thank God.  Rand knelt and felt along his friends knee.   Hey, now dont you start getting frisky with me. Jonathan joked.

She did break it, Jonathan.   And youre a lucky man.  She healed it too.   Now you know why I kept telling you to never under estimate her.   She can be a deadly foe.  She was trained right along side me, Jonathan.  Dont ever forget that.  He said as he stood up.

But you can handle her cant you?  Jonathan joked.

Actually we could actually end up hurting each other.   She is my equal in every way, including that particular area.  But I trust her not to hurt me. We care to much about each other to let that happen.

This is why I dont want a wife with powers.   I dont want to worry about her trying to kill me during a temper tantrum.  The moment the words left Jonathans mouth, he realized that he had said the wrong thing.   He felt Patience go rigid next to him.  Now Patience, honey- he started.

Dont! she hissed. I swear you have a head full of rocks, Jonathan, to think that only a woman with power could kill you, during a tantrum. And as far as I can tell, she has every right to be pissed off.  How would you like it if I had my father order you to marry me without your consent and you have no choice in the matter.   This is after he has consulted with your father on the compatibility of our union?

Jonathan growled and surged to his feet.  Id beat you to the alter sweetheart. 

I think this is my cue to exit.  Rand said dryly.   But neither one of them were paying any attention to him.   They seemed to be squaring off against each other.   He decided to let them work it out.  But he couldnt think of a better person for his best friend.

************************************************************************************
	
Standing outside in his gardens Rand stared up at the stars.  He wasnt surprised when his father joined him.   
	
Hi, Dad. 

How are you holding up, son?  I know this has to be difficult for you.  

Yes, but its going to be just as difficult for her, dad.   She doesnt realize the extent of our bond yet.  But she will.

I see, youre going to force her hand.

No, but the first time she merges with me, Ill have her. And she wont leave my side until the wedding vows are spoken.   And maybe not even then.  Rand said as he watched the moon rise.

And how long son are you going to be able to resist the urge to merge with her.

As long as I have to. And the new moon will be here before long.   Neither of us stands a chance against the mezclar once the new moon rises.   Shes going to come back to me. Or Ill just drag her back.   Shell have no choice.

****************************************************************************************

Grace watched as moon rose over head.  It was almost full.   Somehow she knew that Rand would be watching the same thing as she.   She longed to share it with him, but knew the first time that she even brushed against him mentally  he would have her.   And she knew it.    Pushing her hair back from her face she continued to look up at the moon.   She was already homesick.   And it had nothing to do with where she was at.  And to her dismay she knew that home would always be with Rand.    Ever since she was a girl she had been tagging along behind him.   Damn him anyways!  She fumed.   He just had to go and change everything.    But the changes he has brought are exciting, her inner voice countered.   You would love to be intimate with our future king.   Lets face your fear here, you are in love with him and have been for a long time.  Oh be quiet, she told her inner voice.   She was tired of fighting the attraction between her and Rand, tired of fighting the mezclar.  Just plain tired.    
Turning she walked to the sleeping chamber.  Maybe the best thing to do was to put her self in a meditative sleep.    Sighing she sat down on the bed.  Sitting crossed legged, she attempted to begin the first steps of the meditative sleep.    As she slowly focused she became aware of another presence.    She didnt need to examine the presence to realize that the presence was Rands.  Examining the connection she realized that somehow, her and Rands powers were intertwined.  Which meant that there was no real way to start the meditative sleep without his help.  And if she contacted him to help he would be here in a moment to take her back.  Back to the madness and wild desire that seemed to rule both of their lives.   So she laid down on the bed and watched the moon slowly make its way across the sky.

*************************************************************************************

When dawn arrived the next morning, Gracie was standing in front of the window, watching the sun begin its ascent to the cloudless sky.  She hadnt gotten much sleep during the night.   What little she did get had been plagued by erotic dreams of her intended.   When she awoke each time drenched in sweat with her body tight with unfulfilled desire, she would roll over and try to go back to sleep.   But since she had left the palace,  sleep had been the enemy and a very elusive one at that.   As the sun crept higher in the sky, she wondered how Rand was faring. If he had done as she suggested and found another.   Since their high school days, Rand had the pick of who he wanted to date.
 
Surely my father and his could find another.  She said out loud.

Like hell.  Rand said coming from the adjoining room.   Walking farther into the room, he shut the door behind him. Its you or no one.  He said stopping inches from her.  I suggest, Gracie that you accept your fate. You and I are getting married in two days.

How did you find me? she asked.

You merged with me last night.   Several times in fact.  You damn near drove me out of my mind. Rand said huskily.

You mean every time I dreamed I was- she asked her face flaming.

Yes.  After the first time.  I got up and tracked you here.  I damn near had an accident when you merged with me the second time.   Dreaming about tying me up and having your way with me when Im driving is not a good idea, Gracie.   When she moaned softly and headed towards him, he stepped back quickly.  Dont touch me, Grace.  He told her sternly.    She stopped and ducked her head.   Embarrassment ran through her.   This was why she had left, she fumed.  She had no pride and no control of her body. As she turned away she heard a knock on the adjoining door.   She heard Rand tell the person to come in.  She was not surprised when she heard Jonathans voice.   Those two were near inseparable.   Jonathan would probably go on their honeymoon with them, she thought furiously.   

Rand watched the tension build in Gracie.   Whatever she was thinking was not good.   He knew if he pushed any harder she would flee or fight him.  Jerking his head towards the door, Rand motioned Jonathan to cover that exit.    Walking as close as he dared, he spoke softly.

Gracie, mi reina, whats wrong?  Talk to me.  Rand coaxed.

Wrong?  Whats wrong!  Gracie said sharply.  Everything is wrong, you ass.   Im tired of being told what I am going to do, when I am going to do it, and who I am going to do with it.   Im tired of not being in control of my body.  Whatever the hell you did to me, you can undo, Prince Randall!  I didnt ask to be married to you. I didnt ask to participate in the damn, mezclar!   Just leave me the hell alone!  Gracie said hotly.   

Now, sweetheart. He soothed, trying to be patient with her.  

Dont you sweetheart me!   Im pissed!   You can take your offer and stick it where the sun dont shine, your highness.   Itll be a cold day in hell before I marry you!  

Well, then you better done your wedding dress, Gracie, because hell just froze over.  Rand said coldly.  Ive run out of patience.   I dont care what my dad predicted.  Were getting married today.  To hell with tradition. Im tired of fighting it.   Hope you have booked this room for a week, Gracie.  We might be able to leave the bed by then.  He growled, grabbing her by the arm and dragging her out of room.   Jonathan stood in front of the door and braced himself for the fight of his life.   There was no way in hell that he could let them go and get married today.   He had promised King Mica that he would bring them both back to be married at the palace.

Rand, I cant let you do that.  I promised your dad that I would-   Jonathan started to say before his best friend landed a punch on his chin.  Cursing under his breath, he tried to remain calm.   Losing his cool wouldnt help his friend.  Damn that hurt Rand.  Jonathan said. But Im still not letting you leave here.  Let me take you back to the palace.

Fuck the palace. he snarled, as he pushed Jonathan away from the door.
	
No, fuck this!  Jonathan snarled right back.  This is what I get for being your best friend?  You know, your highness, I wish that you two would grow up! 

 Turning towards Gracie, he focused his hot gaze on her.  Gracie, you and Rand have been destined to be together for years.   Get over it!  Rand could have claimed you ten years ago!   He knew it, I knew it, the King knew it, your dad knew it.  Christ even Princess  Deanna knew it.   Why else do you think she attacked you! He said hotly.

Turning to the prince, he added, And you, Rand, stop acting like a spoiled kid.  You will have her soon enough.   Dont ruin this for your parents.  Jonathan scolded. Or Gracies parents at that.  They have been waiting just as long to see you two wed.   Now, you both will calm down, well leave for the palace and in two days I will personally see that you are married.  Then you are on your own.   I have my future wife to woo.  Jonathan finished.   Then grabbing both of them he drug them outside to where they had parked Rands vehicle the night before.
