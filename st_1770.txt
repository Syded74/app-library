<b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>Twenty
minutes after losing her tiny bikini top, Kylie had deftly and smilingly&nbsp;
removed her equally tiny thong , waving it triumphantly around her pretty
head a few times before tossing it down to the cheering crowd below to
join the rest of her meagre outfit.&nbsp; This caused even more of a riot
this time,&nbsp; hospitalising two unfortunates and leaving several others
bruised and bleeding.&nbsp; The Colonel,&nbsp; who was watching from the
vantage point of the Rose and Crown's saloon bar window,&nbsp; chuckled
appreciatively.&nbsp; This really was turning out to be a splendid day!&nbsp;
He thought of Kylie's father and his happiness lessened momentarily, but
after all said and done, his was only one vote.</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>Whether it was the sense of freedom
that her first ever experience of outdoor, let alone public, nudity brought
her, or the fact of her body's belatedly adjusting to the many sudden temperature
changes,&nbsp; Kylie was really enjoying every minute of it by&nbsp; this
time and she pushed into a mental recess, the knowledge that her father
was certainly going to give her the thrashing of her life, and then some,
when he returned and heard all about today.</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>Kylie's daring made the baying
crowd yell out for the other two to follow suit.&nbsp; They kept up a cacophony
of sound which after twenty long and noisy minutes, showed no sign of abating.&nbsp;
"Come on darlings, get em off", being the only identifiable words to emerge
from the maelstrom of noise.</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>The other two were reluctant
at first, both aware that the welfare of their own tender young bottoms
was in peril.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the onlookers' full-throated persistence
bore fruit after a further forty minutes, when Tracy removed her fluorescent
top.&nbsp; She passed it to her boy friend, Dean,&nbsp; who had just turned
up at this time and instructed him to take good care of it as it had cost
her a lot of money.&nbsp; Dean complied leeringly.&nbsp; He was glad that
all his mates could see what a fantastic pair of knockers his beloved possessed!&nbsp;
Thirty minutes later they were to see the rest of her goodies!&nbsp; As
Tracy slipped off her bottom, the conformist Darlene,&nbsp; not wishing
to be&nbsp;&nbsp; left out,&nbsp; also bared all.&nbsp; It was at this
point that they became aware of a commotion on the other side of the square.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>................................................................................................................................................................................</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>"There now, Mrs Jenkinson!&nbsp;
That's about as tight as I can make it!&nbsp; I always was good at knots.&nbsp;
You can't move an inch in any direction, can you, you poor old dear!&nbsp;
That'll teach you to fool around with me!&nbsp; I must leave you now -
I have to&nbsp; compete with Dorothy as an attraction - alas, that will
be a slight consolation for you, I fear and rather painful for me!&nbsp;
Then I must help out with the water tank and assist generally now that
you are all tied up and the Colonel and Uncle seem to have gone missing.&nbsp;
Come with me Beatrice, we can leave this old cow on her own for a couple
of minutes - she won't be going anywhere!"</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>When the two cousins were alone,
Julia told Beatrice to fetch Mr Moss, the village barber - or Gentleman's
Hair Stylist as he lately and grandiloquently started to call himself.&nbsp;
This gentleman soon arrived, looking distinctly uneasy but his face lightened
when Julia merely asked for the loan for an hour or so, of his leather
razor strop.&nbsp; Acting on her instructions, the dutiful Beatrice fashioned
a placard which was placed against the wooden screen lately used for the
knife throwing act.&nbsp; It read as follows.</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>"LEATHER&nbsp; MY LOVELY BOTTOM!
NO BLOW TOO HARD TO TAKE FOR THIS TOUGH COOKIE!&nbsp; &pound;2.50 PER BLOW
PER CHEEK.&nbsp; ENJOY!"</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>"There.&nbsp; I can't have those
peasants laying their dirty hands on me.&nbsp; Even my arse is too good
for them to touch!&nbsp;&nbsp; But they are welcome to use dear Mr Moss's
strop on it for an hour or so.&nbsp; Go and look after Mrs J, my sweet.&nbsp;
I'll take care of this side of things.&nbsp; As soon as Dorothy tires of
having her bum slapped I'll wrap this up and get over to the tank to help
out those poor girls.&nbsp; I'll soon overtake her takings - what with
charging so much more and having such a much nicer bottom anyway."</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>Beatrice looked very doubtful
as to her cousin's wisdom, but did as she was told and went over to the
Altar, where the collection box was filling up fast, although not as fast
as if Julia had been the victim.&nbsp; Mrs J's nephew, the fraudster travel
agent was commiserating with his distressed relative as Beatrice returned
to her post as Priestess. "Fuck off sunshine" said Beatrice, whose use
of language was far freer than her cousin's, "But leave a fiver behind
you before you retire to the Feathers or wherever.&nbsp; Yes, the Feathers
I think - easily the nastiest joint in town, right up your street, arse
hole!"</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>Mr Fenton-Jones complied.&nbsp;
He had always feared Beatrice for some reason. After depositing part of
his ill-gotten gains as directed he slunk off, his tail metaphorically
between his bandy legs (The poor man had suffered as a child from Rickets)</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>As she stood by the makeshift
altar, the sound of leather falling on sweet tortured flesh began to sound
out across the square, drowning out the noise of the much milder slaps
which were still being administered to the homely and increasingly pink
peasant buttocks of the good Dorothy.&nbsp; For the first time in the last
half hour, Mrs Jenkinson began to feel better.&nbsp; Her plan had after
all worked out after a fashion.&nbsp; A bird in the hand and all that!</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>Mr Fenton-Jones's group began
to mingle with the townsfolk and take part in the various activities.&nbsp;
Some were particularly taken by the naked Kylie, who was just on the point
of being joined in her total exposure by the other two.&nbsp; Some preferred
the sight of the poor Mrs Jenkinson and her attendant Priestess lovely.&nbsp;
A not&nbsp; inconsiderable number joined the lengthening queue of those
anxious to administer cruel chastisement to the still shapely but already
badly thrashed bottom of the stoic and ever smiling Julia.</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>Mr. Cyrus A Parkinson of the
great and beautiful city of Vancouver BC was the last person on that memorable
day to lay hands on the sore bottom of poor Dorothy, who signified, once
his large firm hand had descended with stinging force on that bruised rump,
that she had bloody had enough, thanks all the same.</font></font></b><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#330000"><font size=+2>Beatrice saw this (she had been
looking out for this and praying that it would happen soon) and ran over
to her cousin, who looked mightily relieved.&nbsp; Sadly for Julia, she
had been in the middle of a transaction as Beatrice arrived and felt in
honour bound to cater for this one last customer.&nbsp; To both girls'
horror, the said customer,&nbsp; a large and powerfully built lady, who
had long resented her husband's admiration for Julia,&nbsp; was flourishing
a fifty pound note.&nbsp; She was emphatic that she did NOT want any change!</font></font></b>
