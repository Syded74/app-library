Deck the girls in naught but holly,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
'Tis the season to make men jolly,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.

Don we now our Christmas vestments,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.
We're our uncle's Yuletide presents
Fa la la la la, la la la la,



We wrap ourselves in Christmas paper,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
And thus begins our Christmas caper,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.

Dance and sing and drink wassail,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.
We're perfect little baits for jail,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.



All we want to do is please,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
We give our uncle our first striptease,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.

Off go bras and out comes titty,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.
He doesn't care that they're itty bitty,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.



We drop our pants and show our pussies,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Turn around and shake our tushies,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.

Dance around the Christmas tree,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.
Offer our virginity,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.



Kiss each other and grind our hips
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Then turn to him and spread our lips,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.

Now his big cock hangs before us,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.
Before we fuck we sing the chorus,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.


We ride his cock, first you then me,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
We give him a private Christmas party,
Fa la la la la, la la la la.

I suck his cock, you kiss his balls,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.
We're his secret Santa sex dolls
Fa la la la la, la la la la.



Now we're our uncle's favorite toys
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
Spreading legs and Christmas joys
Fa la la la la, la la la la.

The time for him to come is here,
Fa la la, la la la, la la la.
So he sprays us with his Christmas cheer!
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
