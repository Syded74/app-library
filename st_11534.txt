From the pen of Bertram W. Wooster: In which plans are made and ethics are discussed.

Chapter 13: Preux Chevalier

It was full dark by the time we arrived near Wapping Lane and found a secluded place to park the car. I would have driven right up to the door of the nearest warehouse, but Jeeves suggested that it would be less conspicuous if we were to park further down the road and walk. There were a number of warehouses on the street, and it would take a careful and catlike stealth to determine which one was housing our quarry.

Any sensible and well-groomed cat would have avoided this street, however. The rain had let up, but the foul smell of mould, fish, and waste hung in the air with the mist. The pavement was slick with puddles, many of which were disguised as shadows due to the absence of sufficient streetlamps. After stepping in my third such puddle, I decided that even cats would have a devil of a time walking quietly in this mess.

Watson was our vanguard since he had more experience with this sort of thing, i.e. sneaking up on villainous lairs--the people in the lair being villainous, that is, not the lair itself, which could potentially be as benign as a row house or a tobacconist's. Jeeves brought up the rear and I was between them, ostensibly because they each had a weapon and I did not, although I couldn't help but to feel that I was being herded or contained, like a piece of undisciplined cheese between two pieces of stern, armed bread. I felt a bit useless, but I did not for one second doubt that before the night was out Bertram Wilberforce Wooster would have his moment.

I was so busy thinking about this Moment, what it would look like and how I would have it, that I didn't notice when Watson stopped in his tracks. If it weren't for Jeeves's quick reflexes, grabbing my shoulder and holding me back, I would have run square into him. Watson's back was taut and his left hand rose in a gesture indicating that we should wait.

"What is it?" I whispered.

Watson shook his head and hissed for silence. I clammed up obediently and was rewarded with a finger pointing down the street. I squinted in the darkness. A shadow crept across the lane, anonymous until it gained the pavement on the other side and passed under a streetlamp. It was Inspector Cinwell, the man who had arrested Watson not two nights ago, and he was walking in our direction.

Watson pushed me into a nearby alley with such force that I staggered and nearly fell into a heap of rotting leaves. I caught myself against the wall and prepared for action, although what action it would be I was not quite sure. Meanwhile, Watson drew his pistol and thumbed the whatsit on the end so it made a click. Cocked, that's the word I want, he cocked his pistol. He then nodded meaningfully at Jeeves and received a solemn bow of the head in turn. I wondered if they'd worked out some sort of code involving various and sundry head shakes in advance, or if these were standard recognized signals known by people who have served crown and country, as Watson did in Afghanistan and Jeeves did in the early days of the Great War. Regardless, I had no idea what they were planning, but as they seemed to have the thing well in hand, I took myself out of their way. Jeeves stationed himself against the wall where the alley met the lane. When the inspector passed, Jeeves lashed out like a striking viper or a lightning bolt or something equally fast and deadly.

He looped his right arm tight about the man's neck, and, clapping his left hand over the chap's mouth, hauled him back into the dark alley. A second later, Watson pressed his revolver against the inspector's temple, instantly curtailing Inspector Cinwell's incipient struggles. Cinwell raised his hands in surrender.

Once the situation was thus made clear to the inspector, Watson took a step back, saying, "Wooster, check him for weapons and bind his hands."

"Right ho." Spotting a gun at the inspector's waist, I drew it from its holster, and not knowing what else to do with the blasted thing, I tucked it in my waistband and resumed my search. No further weapons found, I looked about for a length of rope, going so far as to turn out my pockets, although I was pretty sure I hadn't stashed any rope, cord, binding, or even twine on my way out the door this evening. "I say, with what shall I bind him?" I asked, at a loss.

Jeeves, as always, had a solution. "If you should remove your tie, sir, I believe you would find that it will answer for the purpose."

"Tie him up with my tie, what? When you put it that way, it seems so obvious that I can't imagine why I didn't think of it myself," I said, my hands tugging at the old half-windsor.

"Nor I, sir."

It was a bit awkward, tying Inspector Cinwell's hands behind his back while Jeeves still held him locked in his grip, but I managed. I'm a pat hand at tying knots, have been since I was a lad. Untying them, however, is another matter. At Eton, I once had to cut the laces off a pair of shoes to remove them from my feet. Fortunately, I was not excessively fond of this particular tie and would not weep were it to become necessary to break out the scissors at some later time.

Cinwell was subdued and surprisingly agreeable about the whole tied-up-in-an-alley thing; undoubtedly Watson's steady aim contributed to Cinwell's placidity. Once he was adequately bound, Jeeves pushed down on the inspector's shoulders gently but implacably 'til he was forced to seat himself on the ground.

Cinwell winced as he sat. "You couldn't have picked a drier spot, could you?"

"The state of your trouser seat should be the least of your concerns," Jeeves replied.

"Where is Holmes?" Watson interrupted, impatiently. "And do not think of trying to deny your involvement."

Cinwell raised his shoulders in an abbreviated shrug, hampered by his bound wrists. "I'd no intention of denying it. Circumstances being what they are, there would be little point."

"Then tell me where Roberson is keeping Holmes."

"The large warehouse across the road and four buildings down," he replied readily. Too readily, I thought, but Watson didn't seem keen to question the gift horse's truthfulness.

Watson said to Jeeves and me, "Guard him and ensure that he doesn't escape or sound an alarm. I'll see if I can find Holmes."

As he was leaving, Jeeves stopped him with a hand on his arm. "Sir, I appreciate your anxiety, but I believe that your emotions are causing you to act with precipitous haste. If you truly wish to save Mr. Holmes, and not, instead, merely increase Roberson's leverage by recklessly placing yourself within his grasp, I recommend we proceed with caution."

In the diffuse light from the streetlamp, which gave the mist a sickly glow, I could see on Watson's face the conflict of head and heart playing itself out. Jeeves's advice was wholly logical, but that dratted malady love attacked the wits above all else, as I had ample cause to know. I had observed it in others many a time, and I don't doubt that I'd be experiencing much the same mental agony if Jeeves were ever held captive in a warehouse by a homicidal felon.

"Roberson has used you against Mr. Holmes before," Jeeves continued. "Would you so readily put yourself in a position to be used again?"

That threat to Holmes decided it more than any possible endangerment of Watson's own life. He breathed a shaky sigh and returned to where Cinwell sat. "You'd better lead the interrogation, Jeeves. I'm not…" His sentence drifted off, unable to encompass what he was and was not at that moment. Jeeves didn't press for details, but crouched face to face with Inspector Cinwell.

"You have made no attempts to flee, even while two-thirds of your guard were distracted," Jeeves said.

"Would you like me to?" Cinwell answered, his tone strangely flat and lacking in fear, disdain, braggadocio, or any of the other things one might expect from a man in his position. Instead, he behaved as if he were a distant spectator of events, one who had little interest in the situation, conversation, or life in general.

"I am merely making a curious observation. Most men in your position would at least be contemplating escape, whereas you appear wholly indifferent to your circumstances."

"I assure you, I'm not indifferent. My trousers are soaked and my arse is getting bloody cold."

"Who are you working for? Roberson?"

"No. Adams. Superintendent Adams." He chuckled. "Think of Adams as the contractor and Roberson as the rich and demanding client. I, of course, am the exploited labourer."

"What service is Roberson contracting?"

"At first, it was simply to frame Dr. Watson for the theft of the Jewels of Tarpeia, to hold him in custody until further notice was given, and to make sure Mr. Holmes was aware of the situation. I wasn't told why and I've found that in circumstances like these it's better not to ask."

Watson broke in. "Where did you get the fob that you presented as evidence?"

"Adams gave it to me. I don't know where he got it--possibly from Roberson, possibly from some other police officer Adams has under his thumb. Adams put me on the de Glanville case and told me to suppress whatever evidence I found that pointed to anyone other than you as a suspect and to drop that fob on the grass for one of the constables to find. Surprisingly, I had to suppress no evidence at all. It was a masterful job; what little evidence I found legitimately--a partial footprint under the sill--could indeed have come from you." He stopped, staring at Watson with curiosity.

Watson scoffed. "I dare say there are thousands, even tens of thousands of other people in this city with shoes similar to mine. They're hardly unique."

"Quite right," Cinwell said. "Not enough to justify an arrest, but when combined with the fob it was enough to hold you for a while. Adams told me that if you went to the summary court then the conviction was in the bag, and if you insisted on a trial by jury then further damning evidence would be brought forward to secure the desired verdict."

"Justice bought and sold," Watson spat.

Jeeves resumed his questioning. "And what task are you carrying out for Roberson at present? What brought you here tonight?"

"I was making arrangements with him for finding Mr. Holmes's body."

The silence that followed such a chilling statement was a heavy presence pressing on my tongue. Ever since my own close brush with death at Roberson's hands, I'd known that murder might be in the offing, but despite such awareness it nevertheless came as a shock to hear Holmes referred to as a "body." Watson, to my surprise, was the first to regain speech, slow and halting though it was. "Holmes…is he?...he's dead then."

Cinwell smiled tightly. "Not yet."

Relief burst from Watson in a shuddering breath. "Thank God!"

"God has nothing to do with it," Cinwell retorted. "Roberson is enjoying watching Holmes go mad."

"'Go mad?'" Watson said. "What do you mean 'go mad?'"

"Roberson's got him caged up, like an animal, and when I saw him he was--" For the first time since his capture, I detected a glimmer of emotion in Cinwell. He turned away so that his face was wholly in shadow. When he continued his story, his words had a raspy edge. "Sometimes he would just writhe and spasm, limbs contorted and neck twisted unnaturally. He would scream and thrash as if terrified, eyes bulging and darting about wildly. Other times he'd have moments of somewhat greater lucidity and would beg for water and babble about being burned alive."

"Ah-ha, I know this one!" I said, grateful for the opportunity to contribute. "Radix pedis diaboli, what?" I looked to Watson for confirmation. I naturally hoped that it was not so, as the poisonous root was deadly and capable of driving a man permanently insane, but it seemed the most reasonable guess.

Watson shook his head slowly. "No. No, it doesn't sound right; there are many other substances that can cause hallucinations. The poor souls afflicted with the devil's-foot root were utterly raving. There were no lucid periods while under its effect."

"And there's no place Roberson could have administered it," Cinwell added. "The warehouse has no small rooms and Roberson hasn't taken Holmes anywhere else. The root needs to be burnt in an enclosed space to be inhaled by the victim in sufficient quantity, yes?"

"Yes," Watson replied acidly.

"I have read your stories, Doctor."

"But clearly failed to absorb any moral precepts from them."

Cinwell paused before he replied, each word clipped. "We can't all be Sherlock Holmes."

Watson was ready to give some sort of cutting rejoinder, but Jeeves steered the interrogation back to its rightful course. "Do you know what Roberson gave Holmes?"

"No. It was administered before I entered the scene. Holmes was already in a frenzy when I arrived and he remained so during my entire stay."

"How long was that?"

"Around an hour. Roberson insisted on playing genteel host," Cinwell sneered. "Although I suspect what he really wanted was an opportunity to show off his trophy." Watson muttered an imprecation under his breath. Cinwell continued as if he hadn't heard. "I think it was wearing off, though. That or he simply wore himself out. Whatever the cause, by the time I left Holmes was quieter than he had been when I arrived."

"Aside from Roberson and Holmes, who else is in the warehouse?"

"There are four other people. Common hired thugs from the look of them."

"Armed?"

"At least one of them had a pistol. I didn't see whether the others were likewise equipped, but I suspect so. Roberson's very proud of his prize and doesn't want it getting away."

Jeeves stared at Cinwell for many long seconds, a hard glare that could turn a chap inside out and make him squeal. Cinwell offered nothing else, however. At last, Jeeves stood to confer quietly with Watson.

"Sir," Jeeves said to him. "Given the facts that we are outnumbered and outgunned and on hostile territory, I recommend that we take an indirect approach."

"Are you getting one of your corking schemes, Jeeves?" I asked, my heart lifting at the thought. If anyone could save the day, it was Jeeves.

"Not all the pieces are yet in place, but I am working on it, sir."

"We do have the advantage of surprise, at least," Watson said. "If we burst through the door, take them off guard, I'm sure I could shoot at least one of them before they could react. If you, Jeeves, could take one as well, between the two of us, if we're lucky, we could at least even the odds a bit."

Cinwell, who must have been listening intently to overhear their quiet muttering, laughed a dry, acrid laugh. "Don't be daft," he scoffed. "Roberson will spot you in one second and shoot you in the next. You don't want to go barging through the front door. You'll want to go around to the east side of the building. In the back there's a small door, nearly invisible. It looks like it hasn't been used in ages. There are old crates stacked in front of it that are half rotted from exposure. If you're very careful, you might be able to enter through there undetected."

"If it's nearly invisible, how do you know of it?" Watson asked suspiciously.

"I scoped the whole outside carefully before I met with Roberson. Knowledge is power, as they say."

"Wait just a blasted minute," I said. "Aren't you on Roberson's side? Why would you tell us all this unless it's some sort of trap? We go in the back door thinking it's safe when it's really under guard by men with guns, and all that?"

Cinwell twitched an eyebrow in a half-hearted facial shrug. "I've no loyalty to that bastard, and Dr. Watson's criticism of my moral fibre aside, I don't enjoy seeing a decent man murdered."

"Yes, but if you are lying, then that's exactly what you would say." I said.

"I do not believe the inspector is being mendacious," Jeeves replied, contemplating Cinwell's face. "If I am assessing the inspector's psychology correctly, he is a man to whom crime did not come naturally, but for whom it was learned. He probably showed no delinquency as a child, but slipped into vice only as an adult. He did so with full cognisance of the moral repercussions of his choice. He no longer balks at immoral acts and has coldly participated in many misdeeds. He was perhaps once idealistic, but is now cynical. His criminal activity is not performed on his own initiative, but at the bidding of those who have power over him. Bitterness fuels a desire to lash out at his superiors in whatever feeble way he can. He is a villain, perhaps, but pathetically so, out of habit and fear of retribution more than any real malevolence."

Cinwell's mouth hung open in shock. At last he spoke. "I think your opinion of me was more flattering when you thought me irredeemably evil."

"Roberson, exercises his own free will, however appallingly wicked that will may be." Jeeves replied. "You, however, have washed your hands of your moral agency, allowed yourself to be led by others, and have permitted your sense of ethics and decency wither into apathy. Although Roberson is assuredly the more malicious, I would nevertheless be hard pressed to decide which of you is more contemptible."

An uneasy chill ran down my spine at Jeeves's words about "free will" and "agency", although I could not swear to its source. It may have been the mere thought of the mighty force of the Jeevesian ire, or the reminder of what foul people I'd become surrounded with these last few days, or just a cold breeze coming off the river and slipping under my collar. Whatever the source, it niggled under my skin and refused to be cast aside. I had the feeling that my brain--which, despite being often referred to as deficient, negligible, or barmy, did experience the occasional bright flash--was trying to tell me something, something unpleasant that I'd rather not hear. I ignored its rusty groan and turned to more practical matters.

Succeeding in this herding of the mental sheep down the proper pathways, I said, "I think the most sensible option would be to wait for Lestrade's police contacts to arrive. Then we could hand Inspector Cinwell into their custody, surround the warehouse, and demand Roberson's immediate surrender."

Watson didn't seem very chuffed at this plan. I suppose waiting patiently outside the building where his dearest companion is being tormented until reinforcements arrive would be trying for any man of action. Jeeves, too, was unconvinced. "Roberson does not strike me as the sort who would surrender easily."

"He'd put a bullet through Holmes' head just to get one last memorable victory in before he was arrested," Cinwell said.

"So we can't wait for the police and do it the official way," Watson said. "What are our other options?" Watson and I looked at Jeeves.

"We do have a hostage of our own, sir, whom we could put to use."

I turned to where Jeeves indicated. Cinwell, however, laughed. "There's not a chance in hell that I'll get you anywhere. He doesn't give a damn about me. His deal is with Superintendent Adams. And the Super has plenty of other inspectors on his unofficial payroll; he won't mind if I go missing. I'm expendable. You won't get anywhere by holding me hostage. Sherlock Holmes is worth hundred times more than I am and Roberson knows it."

"I wasn't proposing an exchange, but a distraction."

I was a bit lost. "What are you getting at, Jeeves?"

"I suggest that Dr. Watson enter through the front with the inspector here as a hostage. While he engages in negotiations, thus distracting Roberson and his guards, I enter through the rear entrance and venture to liberate Mr. Holmes. When Mr. Holmes is free, Dr. Watson extracts himself by whatever means necessary. It is an extremely perilous strategy, and fraught with uncertainty, but with such constraints of time and manpower it is the best I can put forth."

"Sounds as good as anything," I said. "But what do I do, while Watson here is dangling bait out front and you are sneaking around the back?"

"You will remain outside and inform the police of the situation when they arrive."

Even I could tell when I was being pushed aside. Had I asked, undoubtedly words such as "for your own good" or "out of harm's way" would have been uttered, so I didn't bother asking. Instead I demanded, "No no no and no. On no account am I going to twiddle my thumbs on the street whilst you and Watson are walking into Lord knows what danger." I took out Cinwell's pistol from the waistband where I'd stashed it. "I've got a weapon now, so I might be of some use. I coming with you, and I shall not be gainsaid."

"As you wish, sir," Jeeves said in that rummy sort of voice, which he employed when the polite words he was saying were completely opposite to what he was feeling, which was more along the lines of "go boil your head." He did not openly object, although I had a sneaking suspicion that he was merely biding his time.

"Do you know how to use that?" Watson asked, gesturing towards the pistol.

"Well, a bit. That is to say, I did a spot of pheasant hunting out at Aunt Dahlia's place once, although we used rifles, which were, as I recall, a fair bit larger than this little thing. I didn't hit any pheasants but I did fare better than my friend Gussie Fink-Nottle. He couldn't get his gun to go off at all and couldn't work out why until later that evening when Cousin Angela pointed out that he'd never once loaded the bally thing."

Watson looked frightfully alarmed at my story relating my firearm experience��"it was hearing about Gussie's foolishness that caused it, no doubt. At last he said, "Just don't point it at anything that you don't mean to shoot."

"You're all barking mad," Cinwell said. "Three," he flicked his glance at me, "Make that two-and-a-half against five, on their turf, every advantage theirs and you're going to waltz on in anyway? Anyone sensible would cut his losses and get out. I could understand the doctor's lapse of reason on account of his close association with Mr. Holmes and consequent fear of losing him, but you two," he shook his head at Jeeves and me, "are either inveterate risk-takers or dangerously thick."

I drew myself up. It was one thing to call me thick��"indeed, it happened with some regularity��" but it was another thing entirely to hurl such an accusation at Jeeves. It was not to be borne. "Nothing of the sort. Loyalty to friends is a motive which I should think both obvious and above reproach."

"Furthermore," Jeeves added, "any ethical man would refuse to abandon a good person to death when it was within his power to stop it."

"You yourself said that you didn't want to see a decent man murdered," Watson said softly.

"But I didn't volunteer to risk my life for his," Cinwell replied.

"You don't have to. So long as you don't betray us to Roberson, I won't harm you. You don't have to help us, just so long as you don't hinder us."

Inspector Cinwell turned his head down in thought. At last, after a few seconds pause, he nodded slowly. "There's a set of lock picks," he said, "in the inside pocket of my jacket. They'll help you get through the back door. None of you gentlemen look like the type to carry such things on your person."

"I didn't think upstanding policemen carried such things either," I said.

"Haven't you been paying attention? I'm not upstanding." Cinwell smiled archly. "Besides, perhaps I did pick up a thing or two from the good doctor's stories. Mr. Holmes wasn't above a bit of judicious breaking and entering, eh?"

"Just what the force needed, I'm sure," Watson replied. "Someone who picked up all of Holmes's most dishonest tendencies and none of his virtues."

Jeeves grasped Cinwell by the elbow and hauled him to his feet, holding him upright even as Cinwell slid on the wet cobbles. Slipping his hand into Cinwell's jacket, he quickly retrieved the promised lock picks before passing Cinwell over to Watson, who, pressing his revolver against the inspector's back, held him in a position not dissimilar to the one I'd been in a few days ago with Roberson. We walked together to the corner of the warehouse Cinwell had indicated, a large, windowless edifice, and paused at the junction where we were to go our separate ways.

"I'll wait ten minutes to give you time to find and unlock the back entrance, then I'll go in," Watson said. "Just…find Holmes, as fast as you can, and get him out." He held his medical bag out to Jeeves. "Take this. Do what you can for Holmes once you've got him to safety."

"We will," I assured him. Jeeves and I began our long walk around the enormous building. As we started down the alley, I mused, "First Ettie, now Inspector Cinwell. You know, Jeeves, Roberson has pretty poor luck in his allies. Pretty soon, he won't have any left at all."

"Nothing so completely baffles one who is full of trick and duplicity himself, than straightforward and simple integrity in another."

"One of yours?"

"No, sir. The Reverend Charles Caleb Colton," he said. "Whereas a wise man will find and cherish his opposite--his complement, if you will--it is the nature of those who are unwise to surround themselves only with those similar in nature, and so men like Roberson, who are dishonest and have no loyalty in their hearts and no understanding of decency or devotion, often find themselves betrayed by others."

All this philosophical talk got my brain shouting for my attention. That shiver down the spine that came on when Jeeves ranted about will and morality and all that brainy stuff had not abated, but the source had at last become clear as the message seeped into my bone and settled uncomfortably there next to assorted criticisms that had been lobbed in my direction over the years. "Did you really mean all that?" I asked. "About the inspector being contemptible for letting others control him?"

"I did."

"Do you…?" I nibbled at my lip, trying to decide how best to phrase the thing but quickly gave it up as a lost cause and blurted it out. "Do you think I'm contemptible? Upon reflection it does seem that everyone else has their way with Bertram W. Wooster and as much as I may resent the intrusion, in the end I acquiesce. It's a…what's the word…en-something…enteric…endemic! That's the chap. It's an endemic feature of my life. Someone--Aunt Agatha, Aunt Dahlia, fellow Drones, assorted ex-fiancées, even you--tells me to do something and I say I won't and then I somehow end up doing it anyway."

"I was referring specifically to moral weakness, and despite various forceful outside influences issuing demands and the occasional misdemeanours into which you have been coerced, you have always retained a firm moral centre. You do not abandon your core principles."

"The Code of the Woosters, what?"

"In part," he replied. "It is also in part your own nature. You may occasionally accede to another's wishes, but you never forsake your sense of self or allow others to fashion you into anything other than what you are."

I tried to wrap my head around the thing, but feared my head hadn't quite the circumference to encompass it. "You mean, I'm all right because at the end of the day Bertram is still Bertram and not some pseudo-Bertram or faux-Bertram of someone else's making."

"Yes."

"I'm not sure I get your meaning there, dear chap, but I'll take your word on it."

"If I may be so bold to suggest, however, it may behove you to be more forceful in placing your own wishes before, or at least equivalent to those of others upon occasion. I think you would find that your life would become, on the whole, more congenial as a result."

"If you think I should, Jeeves, I will by all means give it a try."

A smile lurked in the vowels and peeked around the consonants as Jeeves said, "Indeed, sir."

We turned the corner and crept along the east side of the building. Jeeves whispered to me, "We must be nearing the door now. It would be best if we speak as little as possible from this point on."

"Right ho," I whispered back. We were silent as ghosts, if ghosts had to splash around in puddles, until we reached the door itself. As we carefully pushed the crates aside, Jeeves muttered to me, "It would be best if you waited by the door to ensure that I am not taken by surprise by possible reinforcements of Roberson's."

I did not reply, not an acquiescence or even an acknowledgement. Jeeves, clever chap that he was, knew at once that something was wrong. He raised a querying eyebrow at me. "I know what you're trying to do, Jeeves," I said.

"I made no secret of it. I am endeavouring to ensure that no one slips in from behind."

"There's little chance of that and you know it. You're trying to protect me." I placed my hand on Jeeves's cheek. "I appreciate the thought, old chap, and I know that it's a habit that must be difficult to break considering how often you've pulled the Wooster corpus from the soupiest of soups, and I'm never one to object to a helping hand, but I don't want you to put my welfare above yours. We're equals now, what? So if you're going to put yourself in danger, I'm going to bally well be right there beside you. Metaphorically speaking, since we'd not literally fit through the door walking side by side. Besides, you told me not five minutes ago not to let others boss me about, and so here I am, exercising my will. I want to share the danger with you and I'm damn well going to, no matter what you or anybody else says."

"You pick an inconvenient time to follow my advice, sir."

"Would there ever have been a convenient time to challenge you?"

"Undoubtedly not."

"Well, there you have it."

"I do heartily request, sir, for my safety as well as yours, that you follow my lead and obey my directions once we are inside."

"I think I can agree to that. I'm sure you're more practiced at daring rescue missions than I."

Jeeves looked me in the eye with a decidedly solemn cast to his mien. Just as I was about to open my flap and ask him what vexation put such a rum expression on his face, he dropped the doctor's bag to the ground and grabbed my lapel with a careless violence that would have appalled the fine craftsman who'd stitched this jacket and pulled me into an equally ferocious kiss. I let out what I am ashamed to say was a rodentious squeak, the sound a mouse whose tail has been trod upon might make. This is not to say that I objected; on the contrary, as soon as my initial surprise passed, I ran my hands over Jeeves's sleek head, and, looping my arms around his neck, held him firmly in place and returned his gesture in kind.

It was the most unromantic spot in which I'd ever engaged in an amorous pursuit��"the air clammy and ripe with mould, the light gloomy, and the general atmosphere better suited to Dickens than Austen. I shivered from my crown to my soles all the same as the dismal quality of the setting was overcome by a certain whatsits that this kiss had, which prior ones had not. There was desperation in the intense pressure that pushed my spine back into a curve, and a bit of fear in the tremble of his lips, but also sureness in the soft motions of his jaw and steadfastness in the way his free hand rose to lightly caress my cheek. This was not a Jeeves hesitating, not a Jeeves of two minds, or a Jeeves in doubt. Not, that is to say, the Jeeves of the night before last when we first embarked upon this course. This was a Jeeves who, having jumped in with both feet, had decided that rather than climbing out and calling the whole thing off as a bad deal he would instead dive under and grow gills.

It did not last long, but those few seconds carved for themselves a memorable set of initials on the tree of the Wooster psyche. There was no time to think on it further or speak on the matter, which was just as well, or I fear I would have babbled some embarrassingly soppy nonsense about moonlight and sunsets and roses.

Jeeves set to work picking the lock with brisk efficiency. I suppose I ought to have been surprised that my honest and upright gentlemen's personal gentleman knew the ins and outs of lock picking, but considering the breadth and depth of knowledge and skills Jeeves has shown in the past, I would not have been shocked were I learn that he was adept at tightrope walking and lute making and knew all there was to know about particle physics besides. After a little poking and prodding, the lock clicked open.

Jeeves switched out the picks for his gun and motioned for me to have my own pistol at the ready. He silently turned the knob and with a cool professionalism opened the door and aimed at the space beyond. I belatedly pointed my gun around as well, just as Jeeves was doing, but my tardiness was pardonable since there was nothing more threatening than a shelf full of boxes on the other side.

The word "cavernous" springs to mind as the sort of adjective one would attach to a description of the interior of the warehouse. Although I was in a cavern once, in the south of France, and it must have been a cavern of the smaller sort, because it had in no way as high in ceiling or as expansive a breadth as this building. The dim and echoing quality was spot on, though. We left the medical bag just inside the door, so that it would not hinder us if we had to move quickly.

Jeeves went first, gliding on silent feet. It had never before occurred to me to consider how the noiseless tread of a good domestic and his (or her, I suppose, if said domestic were a maid) ability to vanish at will when his (or her) services were not required would naturally lead him (or her) to be skilled in the sort of furtiveness that expeditions of this sort demanded. Jeeves, stealthy as a cat, eyes bright and alert, and pistol at the ready, could have come straight out of MI5. For my part, I took great care that I didn't trip in the darkness over any of the boxes or crates or fall into a shelf. I kept my eyes fixed on Jeeves's broad shoulders and moved when and where he did.

As we manoeuvred around one aisle and slid down another, I grew aware of voices rattling about and bouncing off the walls. The words were unintelligible, too broken up from being tossed from one end of the warehouse to the other and back again, but I thought I recognized Watson's steady cadence. Jeeves picked up the pace and before long we reached the south wall. Up until that point, this building was just like any other warehouse. Unaesthetic, but not sinister. The cages changed all that. They were empty, fortunately; nevertheless, the hisses and groans of despair echoed from them just as plainly as Watson's voice echoed from the main door. I tried to imagine the people who had been trapped in those small cells, and those who will be, but even with the evidence there before me I couldn't comprehend it. It was like something out of the old, barbaric slave trade��"something that I'd thought was safely historical, and the reality of which contradicted my understanding of the world.

I had no time to rethink what I had previously believed were truths about the civility of the modern world. Jeeves led us down the south wall, past cage after grim cage��"a whole row of them. A splash of light spread across the far corner, where the south wall met the west, within which two silhouetted figures stood. As we neared them, Jeeves slowed and walked with his back tight against the cage bars, one more shadow among the shadows. The men��"for that's what the figures were, two large, brutish men��"were busy looking elsewhere, their faces in sharp profile. They didn't notice Jeeves and me creeping towards them.

As we got closer, I saw a third man, too, just on the other side of one of the shelves. Jeeves positioned himself behind and just around the shelf corner from that third man and gathered himself to strike. I remained by the cages, out of his way, and considered what I might do to help. Shoot one of the two silhouettes, perhaps? I'd never shot anyone before, and felt a little queasy at the thought of doing so now, but if it helped Jeeves and saved Holmes, Watson, and all those people who would otherwise be seeing the inside of those cages, I'd do my best. I raised my gun and aimed at the nearest figure.

A shot exploded. For a moment, I thought that I'd pressed the trigger of my pistol without realizing it. A second later the observant part of my brain pointed out to the rest of me that as loud as the shot had been, it did not have the ear-ringing quality of the retort of a gun going off in one's hand. The second after I'd determined that, I panicked. If I hadn't fired the shot, that left open the question of who did, and more terrifying, who was being shot at.

My first thought was for Jeeves, but one glance told me that he was not bleeding on the floor, pierced by a bullet. On the contrary, he was faring quite well for himself, although the same could not be said for the man he'd just pistol-whipped. From my position, I couldn't see either Watson or Roberson, nor had there yet been hide or hair from Holmes.

My immediate fears, if not allayed, were slightly abated; I recalled my determination to assist and stepped forward with my revolver again at the ready. My shot was spoiled, however. Where before there'd been a clean silhouette, now there was a blob of shadow pressed against the bars of the last cage, held there by long, shadowy arms stretching out from between the bars. The second guard drew a knife and lunged forward to help his friend. I figured that it was now or never. I aimed at the knife-wielding man and pulled the trigger.

I missed. I had, however, succeeding in distracting him from knifing the man in the cage, whom I deduced must be Holmes, by revealing my presence. Unfortunately, this resulted in his turning his attention to me. I raised my pistol again, but was too slow to get off another shot before the man was upon me.

He hit the gun from my hand, and I watched in dismay as it skittered across the floor. Grinning, he swept his arm out in a wide arc and I barely jumped back in time to avoid being sliced open like a letter with a letter opener. As I dodged back, I heard more shots exchanged somewhere nearby, but as none of them were hitting me, I was unable to pay them much mind, my focus fixed on the more immediate matter of the man with the knife.

I was not initially worried; after all, Jeeves couldn't be too far away, and I was sure that he would get me out of this tight spot just as he always did. A mad knifeman would no more stand in his way than a demanding aunt or a determined would-be fiancée. When I had to escape two more swings of the blade, and still no Jeeves came, I grew concerned. There were few things that would cause Jeeves to fail to come to my rescue in circs as dire as this.

I scrambled away from my attacker as best I could, grateful that I'd always naturally tended towards fleetness of foot, and in this way kept myself safe against the onslaught. I think I could have carried on in such a manner indefinitely had not dodged just a trifle too far from an attack and crashed into one of the shelves. My balance ruined, the knifeman darted in. I twisted away and nearly fell, but despite my efforts, I was not able to escape the blow.
