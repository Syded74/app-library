>Now rigged poker isn't actually very easy to set up
>For a hand or two sure, but not five hands.
>You have to know how many players you're going to have, and they
all have to know how many cards are in-between hands and make
sure everyone takes exactly that many cards.

>This was something they had all been planning while i was in the
bathroom with raven.
>Comical really, that this is what they were doing while we were
trying to kill one another.
>From what i could assume the main plan belonged to Birthday.
>She was most likely supposed to be dealing the cards, until i
shamed her and handed the deck to Glasses.
>Little-miss-clever was feeding me the rigged hands instead of
whoever was supposed to get them.
>Awesome
>But birthday had tried to exclude Raven from the game.

>Which meant they were probably planning to exclude her anyway
because we weren't getting along.
>Not awesome.
>This is probably why everyone was barely taking any cards
either, Glasses was dealing the hit-pile to raven to fill in the
last player.
>Glasses was also emptying the hit-pile herself every turn raven
didn't, to keep the hands going to me.
>The other girls were just letting it happen.
>I actually don't know why they didn't stop it, scared of getting
caught i guess
>This was a joint-ops tactical plan that had gone very very wrong
for them.

>I glare around the circle, they think i'm contemplating who to
dare.
>"HOMELY, BLONDIE, BIRTHDAY, GLASSES"
>I pronounce each name as a shout, each of them jump when i start
yelling.

>I git em to stand up
>there be a reckoning a brewin , they could feel it in their
bones.

>Thems ladies git off their feet like ol heller at dinner time.
>lil shaky, but they get there.
>Now listen up lassies
>I tell em there be cheatin' involved here
>dontcha know
>each of em looked sadder than a man lost his bottle if you know
what i mean
>eyes to the floor lower than a beggin fool

>The blonde one denied it like a kid caught chasen the neighbor's
chickens into the trees
>The just-turned 15 lass got angrier than that howlin storm took
down that tree up on potter's hill last fall.
>The last two were silent, like a pair caught rompin in the hay
bales top the stables.
>Till the one with glasses broke the silence and distanced
herself from the deed.

>Twas a sight to behold for sure
>Four sorry ass lasses ready about do anythin' to get in my good
graces again.
>I admit mad as i may seem, they sure were a kind view for these
poor eyes.

>Now i've really got no clue what i was planning to do here
>I wasn't actually angry they tried to rig the deck.
>I imagined they wanted to take advantage of me somehow.
>As much as i should have known better, my teenage mind kept
jumping to the most dirty conclusions to getting forced to
complete dares, so i imagined it wouldn't have been too bad.
>I was curious, but that reality had not come to pass
>No; what i was angry about was the fact that they had seemingly
planned to exclude raven out of the game.
>This was really starting to be the point where the girls were
acting really scummy towards one another
>I don't know if it was competition or what, but it was
noticeable.
>Raven was standing behind me as well, surprised and confused at
my yelling
>So i unload the crushing news

>She drops her confusion on the floor
>She's furious
>She'd just taken a ton of flack from birthday and homely
>And they were just planning on backstabbing her anyway
>I'm telling you man, this was getting gritty
>Raven didn't even let me met-out punishment, she just took it
right up
>"I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS"
>Guilt, the most painful of punishments
>"You tried to EXCLUDE ME, your FRIEND, from the poker game
because you're JEALOUS?"
>She punctuated jealous by grabbing onto my arm
>I don't think that helped anything
>As much as she sounded angry, i felt like it was more of her
gloriously good acting.
>She had a plan
>Blondie tries to interrupt "We were going to get you after a
couple of han-

>"THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT!"
>The other girls are staring at the floor shamefully
>Raven laying the WWE smackdown on them.
>She continues mashing them into the floor with some flying leap
slams.
>Gets em nice and softened up for the finisher
>She obviously had some kind of plan she wanted to enact
>Something devious
>She goes on to tell them that if the cheat hadn't been
discovered, they would have won at least 5-6 unfair dares against
each of us unchallenged
>Oh, i see this train of logic
>"So... we both get 4 dares, one against each of you. That we can
use whenever we want tonight"

>I love it
>Yeyesyesyesyes
>I can envision in my head all the things i'd love to dare the
girls to do
>I don't even have to do it when other girls are around so it can
be ANYTHING, muahahaha.
>My inner pervert is gloating if you couldn't tell

>The girls don't like this at all
>There's some serious backtalk going on
>But the uprising is quickly quelled by Queen raven and her iron
fist of guilt
>This is followed by mumbled apologies from Blondie, Homely and
Glasses, and silent indignance from Birthday.
>I figured this was as good as it was going to get, i was
completely ready to sit down and reshuffle the deck and continue
poker.
>But raven wasn't finished yet
>Bless her vengeful heart.
>"If you all want to prove you're sorry, you should take the
dares that were already given to you."
>Ohmanraven
>She seems to be completely on my team tonight
>But i don't understand why she's doing it
>Raven is not a jealousy-free female
>I think she's got a bigger plan
>Cautiously optimistic towards the future...

>I look towards the girls
>They all seem to be contemplating if they want to make amends by
removing articles of clothing
>It strikes me as a sleazy guilt-induced way to undress them
>But i mean i was a teenage male.
>Birthday never said sorry to raven, but it looks like she's
feeling the guiltiest because she wraps her arms around her waist
and discards her shirt first.
>Her gold Bra was actually kinda metallic, duly reflecting the
candle light.
>Blondie goes next, her Blue bra visible to my prying eyes once
more.
>Then Glasses and Homely just shake heads and sit down.
>Spoilsports
>I snatch the deck up from Glasses' lap and thoroughly shuffle
the cards
>Then hand the deck to Raven, she splits it and starts to deal.
>"Wait, you still didn't use your dare yet"
>Its homely
>"Yeah i was saving them for later" - Respond real quick with
this
>God homely you're so stupid
> why would i use 4 random dares right now. gotta plan for the
future man.
>"No.. you won the last hand, you have one more dare"
>Oh that's right
>Even if it was a cheated hand i still had a dare left
>T...thanks homely

>I think for a second about what i want to use it on
>As is the case with Dares, I think about all the super perverted
stuff first
>Then you tone it back into the really perverted
>Further back into just perverted
>And then all the way back to lewd-but-they-might-be-ok-with-it
>I settle on what i want and turn to face raven
>"Raven, i dare you to take off your shirt"
>There we go, the entire room should be even now
>"I hold it"
>WHAT
>Everyone breaks out into laughter at this
>Its seemingly funny now
>In retrospect i probably had a hilarious face on
>I was not expecting raven to refuse
>She's beaten me again
>I just sink back into my seated position and she resumes to deal
with a smirk on her face.

>The first couple of rounds are actually quite boring
>Blondie dares Birthday into telling us the truth about the boy
she had visited over the summer.
>It was a cute story, but nothing that interesting
>Homely wins a round and negates her carried dare but doesn't get
to do anything herself.
>Raven wins a round and does the same.
>The next interesting winner is birthday
>She's got a scowl on her face so it's pretty obvious she's angry
about something, but it changes to an evil, evil smile when she
wins.
>That kind of smile the big-bad mastermind has on when he's
explaining his evil plan to his henchmen
>Right before he kills one to prove how serious he is.
>She turns to Glasses

>Ohh, shit she's angry that glasses didn't deal her cards.
>"I dare you to make out with homely for 30 seconds."

>Hahahaha
>Birthday that's cold
>Homely gives a complete look of disgust at birthday and then
glasses.
>It screams "Why the fuck me?"
>I guess homely was just cannon fodder in this case
>but she was in direct competition with birthday earlier in the
sleepover
>Take down two rivals in one dare
>Glasses is amazing though
>isn't batting an eye
>She goes from a flat smile to a beaming grin
>Then she just drops her arms to her waist and lifts her shirt up
and over her head and she joins the other two shirtless females.
>Oh yeah, she was still holding onto that.
>Clever girl.

>Homely has the teeny-tiniest bit of disappointment on her face
>Or i'm imagining she does
>Obviously my suppressed desires to see various women at the
sleepover with one another.
>We all have those right?

>The next couple of hands are uneventful again
>Glasses burns off her held-dare with a win.
>Blondie Dares my shirt off
>And i'm not a dick so i don't hold it.
>Goodbye green t-shirt
>Raven is the next winner again, her first dare

>She turns to me
>"I dare you to pick and hug ONLY three girls in this room"
>Oh fuck she added an Only
>no escape
>I don't understand her evil plans one bit

>I announce my decision making process
>my brilliant deduction of female value
>"I'm gonna hug the girls who aren't wearing shirts"

>Instant sad face from Raven, the fire and smile in her eyes has
vanished.
>She probably thought it was some clever way of ranking the top 3
girls in the room.
>But she wasn't in the top three because she wasn't shirtless,
which i'm sure brought back insecurity issues.
>I can't contemplate it too long though before someone speaks up
>"Well actually it's pretty hot in here i'm going to just take
th-
>Homely is stopped in her tracks by the glaring lasers of every
other girl in the room
>She kinda sadly drops her arms to her side dejectedly
>Serves her right.
>Blondie gets a leaping cuddle-hug from me first
>Complete with a little bit of back grope/tickling and plenty of
my chest against hers.
>She's cute and fun to hug, it's a shame i have to pull knives
out of my back every time i try.
>Next up is Glasses

>She's soft and romantic as i throw my arms around her
>She's also much warmer skin-wise than blondie, like a searing
forestfire of skin.
>She even giggles as i bring my hands around her lower spine
>She's the romantic cuddly one i'm thinking as i pull away.
>Lastly is Birthday, its more of a flying leap for her
>She ends up on the ground and i end up hugging and giggling
above her

>She's not just letting me hug her though, she's got her hands
all over me
>Even a cup or two of my crotch in the tickle fight that ensues
from our roaming hands.
>I eventually pull back with twice as many boners as i started
with
>Birthday... she's definitely the most "Hands on" in many ways.

>Dare completed
>We resume playing
>The next winner is Blondie
>She pretends to contemplate a dare for about 20 seconds
>Then she just blurts out towards me
>"I Dare you to kiss the girl in the room you like the most"
>Everyone's silent
>what the fuck blondie
>Homely already dared me to do this earlier today
>You didn't even say "ONLY" like raven did to make sure i
couldn't worm out of it.
>You're not even trying... unless
>Oh
>"You just want me to kiss you again huh?"

>She goes bright red when i say these words

>She's been caught
>She even tries to go tsundere and save face
>"Why would i ever want to kiss YOU?"
>I'm not buying it
>But the tsundere was cute
>She was also beyond awful at it, come on that wasn't even an
excuse
>I think might have actually pulled it as a direct quote from
some anime.
>"Just change your dare to ask me to kiss you"
>I don't mix words, if she wants a kiss she wants a kiss
>All the eyes in the room are on Blondie
>She mumbles something
>She's not sitting close to me so i can't hear
>But homely makes a scene out of it with
>"WHAT'S THAT? " and a "REPEAT IT LOUDER!"
>Typical homely really
>Blondie gets the hint though and blurts out
>"I want you to kiss me like you love me."

>Whoah
>L word dropped
>Whole room is silent now
>You don't drop the L word anons
>Not in a situation like this
>It's suicide
>The girls are too surprised to even be jealous
>Homely wasn't as-surprised though
>She was making a scene because she heard full well what blondie
had said the first time.
>She just wanted to start the teasing first
>"Woww, you lovveee him?"
>She's trying to incite a make-fun-of-blondie situation.
>If you've ever been in that kind of situation anons
>There is no escape
>If a single other girl had started teasing blondie she would
have been trapped in an endless loop of shame
>It would all be over for the poor girl
>But they didn't, they were quiet
>Long enough for her to stammer back
>"N...no, i just wanted to know what it feels like..."
>She's practically melted into a red puddle in the floor with how
profusely she's blushing
>"He's the only person i've ever kissed before..."

>Awww blondie
>you didn't tell me that
>I didn't know that the first time you tried to kill me was your
first kiss as well.

>That's almost romantic in two ways
>I think we have a real connection here.
>There are sweet "Aweeess" across the room.
>Blondie melting even girl's hearts now.
>So cutee
>I don't have any choice, or any objections really
>I start to move forward before i find a hand on my own stopping
me
>Its raven
>I look back at her face and she gives me a "You don't want to do
that face"
>W... no raven
>Don't do this to me
>You're going to break blondie's heart
>Raven tells the group "One second" and drags me off
>I don't have a choice but to follow

>I get dragged to the small bathroom
>The door is closed and locked
>Raven turns towards me and my look of "What the fuck"
>Seriously raven you better have a damn good reason for bringing
me here
>"You taste awful"
>W... what
>She hands me a toothbrush
>Oh...
>OH
>Right
>I grab the same toothpaste and toothbrush i had used with
blondie earlier and begin brushing.
>Took a good minute, made sure everything was clean and fresh
>Did two or three rinses with water, to take the edge off the
taste of the toothpaste too.
>"All good"
>I say with a grin
>"Thank for the save rave-
>"Not yet"
>Raven pulls me close and kisses me
>It's not a long kiss
>Just enough for her to get a tongue in my mouth and a good taste
>She pulls away, leaving me hanging there with my mouth open
>"Cinnamon, perfect it's her favorite flavor"
>"Go give her a kiss to remember"
>She says this as she's shoving me out the door.

>I'm re-entering the room with a giant problem though
>I don't know how to kiss someone like i love them
>frankly as far as i could tell, i'm not really sure i had loved
anyone yet
>Or i didn't know how to tell i had loved someone
>Even though raven had told me she loved me, i didn't really know
how to say the same words back
>[spoiler]You don't really know what love is until you've really
experienced heartbreak[/spoiler]
>[spoiler]Then you know what you've lost.[/spoiler]

>That wasn't me yet though
>All i knew about love was from media, Television, anime, video
games.
>Frankly it looked like pretty sappy romantic stuff, sweep the
girl off her feet, tenderly hold her heart in your hands, ect.
>I could do sappy

>I guess i had just kissed her like a teenage boy before.
>I figure i could give her a mature kiss, that can't be that hard
right.
>I keep saying that...

>I've got everyone's eyes on me
>I think raven is getting some glares too for stealing me away
temporarily
>No questions though
>Phew
>I figure if i'm going to be on display, i might as well put on a
show
>This means i strut my stuff right to the middle of the poker
circle.
>I'm sure i didn't look nearly as cool as i pretended i looked.
>Now for the part that didn't work before when i had blondie
alone in the bathroom
>I extend my hand, palm outstretched towards the sitting Blonde
girl at my feet.
>Please take it this time please take it this time please take it
this time.
>She places her hand softly in mine
>Instead of me hauling her to her feet however, she simply
unfolds her legs and stands along with me.
>That's good because hauling her to her feet wouldn't be very
lovey-dovey
>I lead her back three steps to the middle of the circle again
>She follows, hand still in hand.
>She looks absolutely stunning in the candlelight
>A smile, small but a smile nonetheless accompanies her face as
she gazes into my eyes.
>Her eyes are shining softly, as if they're lit from within with
a sense of hope.

>I'm still holding her right hand in mine, so i grasp out with my
left and grasp her left too.
>With a little bit of force i lift her hands up and twist my
wrists around so that my palms face hers
>We're standing as if we're mirrored reflections of one another,
palms flat and placed against the other's like a solid wall.
>Until i bend my fingers into the gaps between hers
>We're now holding both hands.

>I have the silly idea that i might be able to pull her closer to
me by just pulling on her hands
>That doesn't work
>It would if she was stiffened up and holding the tension in her
arms
>But she's not, i've got full wrist control.
>I pull and only her arms follow
>I guess that's good if she was mugging me for crack or
something.
>So the result of me trying to get her close enough to kiss is
really just going to be me pulling my arms back as far as i can
until she runs out of arms
>Which wouldn't work at all.
>It would look awkward as fuck
>So i do the smart thing
>I step closer
>I lean forward
>And then i pull out my gun

>Our lips make contact
>Little bit of a shock actually
>Might be wearing socks on a rug kind of shock
>But if you remember we're both barefoot
>Our arms are still outstretched but holding hands, palms facing
one another
>She's got her eyes closed
>I don't even try to force her lips open at first
>I concentrate on our hands, i lower and pull them in on either
side until we've got them between us , still facing the same
directions they started.

>Appropriate romantic hand-holding posture accomplished
>Stage 2 rockets deploy
>Activate tongue
>Uh oh
>She actually hasn't opened her lips
>I think she got kinda lost in the moment
>That or she didn't realize real lovers kiss with mouths open
>They really don't in... any media
>Ever
>[spoiler] why not ): [/spoiler]
>That's all she knew though, so that's all she's going to give
unless i somehow get her to realize otherwise
>Gotta fix that without alerting any of the other girls
>I think i have a plan
>I pull away from the kiss.

>She can see all of my face now, as i can see all of hers
>I squeeze her hands as i'm holding them.
>She copies me
>I beam a bright huge face-covering smile at her
>She copies me
>I stick my tongue out at her
>She copies me
>Good ol playful blondie, always predictable
>I'm kissing her again before she can pull it back
>I manage to touch her tongue with mine as its trapped between
our lips.
>She gets the hint.
>We play tongue games here, outside the teeth.
>It's different than a teenager frenching
>It's reserved, secretive tongue play.
>The kind you could do in public and nobody would really notice
>The kind you do with your mouth almost closed.
>We continue like that for an endless minute before i decide it's
finally enough and pull away
>I hadn't even realized until then how closely she was pressing
up against me, or how she was arching her heels to kiss me
harder.

>Cute is an understatement

>I come back to the world of reality when i realize there's a
group of hooting applauding girls surrounding us.
>Oh right i was being watched
>And judged
>Probably scored
>Russian judge probably giving me 10s, everyone else 3s and 4s.

>It was an embarrassing break-away from a kiss i'll tell you that

>All the girls weren't making fun of us though, absolute support
all the way.
>Something like that isn't a make-fun-of moment
>Every girl around that circle was imagining themselves in the
same place
>Its the hearthrob romantic moment that every girl wants
>Even though it really wasn't that impressive.
>The kiss itself was lovely, and blondie had a mixture of the
color beet red, and happiness plastered all over her face.

>I wish i had a camera
>Perfect blackmail material

>The poker game is still what we were playing though
>No matter how great that kiss was, i couldn't just pick up
blondie and carry her away.
>I look at the clock
>10:05
>Not bad, time might be elapsing
>We might make it through this blackout in one piece
>I keep saying that...
>Raven deals the next hand
>I get awesome cards
>Pretty sure my poker face is awful
>Can't stop smiling after kissing blondie
>Doesn't matter
>I win
>Fucking finally
>I look around the room trying to decide who i'm going to met my
punishment on
>Someone who hasn't been having any fun yet
>Glasses

Sammich break, 15-20 minutes anons.

>Alright i turn to face her
>"Glasses, i dare you to..."
>I sneak up close to her and whisper in her ear
>It's more fun if the other girls don't know what i'm daring her
to do
>She gets a really surprised look on her face
>Then she gives me the "I'm not doing that face"
>Then i give her the "Come on it would be great" face
>This goes back and forth a bit until i use my face to point out
that it would be pretty hot.
>Her face agrees
>So it's settled then
>I return to my seat

>Glasses sets her eyes on raven

>Raven see's the way glasses is looking at her
>Like bedroom eyes, but from a hungry bear.
>I get the "Oh god what did you do" face from raven.
>I give her the "Just wait" face
>Glasses drops to her hands and knees and starts a very slow
crawl towards us.
>Really really slow
>Like turtle speed
>Too slow because raven panics and tries to escape.
>I'm not having it though, i grab her leg and she kinda flops
over on her back instead of escaping.
>I don't plan on letting go either
>Glasses takes her sweet time, but eventually she's over in the
vicinity of the squirming girl i'm holding onto the leg of
>I really doubt raven is scared, but she knows....
>She knows...
>Glasses stops the slow-crawl schtick and actually kicks herself
into a proper speed
>In a couple well placed hand movements she's now holding herself
above raven's legs and has her head about around her stomach
level.
>Then she growls
>It's cute, it's not a real growl its a fake tiger "Rawr" but
it's adorable.
>Raven just stops struggling and lets out a sigh of relief.

>she thinks that was what was coming to her.
>I didn't even tell glasses to do that bit.

>Glasses knows what she's gotta do though though, in a flash
she's got raven's arms pinned down and i've got both her legs.
>Got her trapped.
>Glasses gives another "Rawr"
>I swear those make it like 20x better than it was in my head.
>She opens her mouth again but this time it's not a rawr
>She kinda shifts backwards and leans towards raven's stomach
>Raven can't get away
>She's trying but she can't
>Glasses grabs the hem of raven's shirt in her teeth
>Starts pulling it upwards
>I have an absolutely perfect view from where i'm holding her
legs
>I watch as she slowly but surely works the hem of the shirt
higher and higher
>It gets to about halfway up the top of the stomach before she
loses grip of it in her teeth.

>Instead of going back to it, she goes to where she started
>places her tongue right where the hem of the shirt initially
was..
>and takes a long lick up past the bellybutton to where the hem
was now
>I definitely didn't tell her to do that.
>Raven is giggling and laughing
>Ever licked someone's stomach anon?
>It doesn't need a spoiler: they laugh.
>[spoiler]or they say eww, that happens sometimes ): [/spoiler]
>But even with the laughter we have her pinned down
>She can't do anything as Glasses works the shirt higher and
higher, to the bottom curve of her breasts
>Then she stops

>Changes position
>Places her teeth on the left side of the shirt and pulls only
that part of the hem up
>Raven's left breast is the first one to be uncovered
>The hem is raised just enough to sit above the beginning curve
before Glasses repositions again
>Right side now
>The process repeats
>Raven has completely stopped squirming and complaining now
>I barely noticed
>I was busy enjoying a bottom-up view of one girl undressing the
other with her teeth
>Outstanding front row seats
>Glasses has both breasts exposed now
>I'm hoping she'll lick or suck one of them
>Hoping
>Hoping...
>She doesn't
>Damn
>Instead she continues raising the hem of the shirt until its
scrunched up against raven's chin
>Now's the hard part
>I don't really know how this is going to go down, but it can't
go down well
>Actually i was wrong
>Glasses just lets go of her arms and says "Raise your hands" in
a whisper
>Quiet enough that i doubt anyone else in the room could hear it
but me.
>Raven just silently complies, her hands above her head
>She seems to be enjoying it
>Or scheming

>Glasses doesn't realize the trap she's fallen into
>But she nips the hem and lifts it over raven's chin and across
her face until its all the way over her head
>Thier lips were inches away from one another.
>The entire time i was thinking "Now Kiss"
>If i had psychic mind control powers, that would be the moment
they manifested in my childhood.
>But it just wouldn't happen
>Plus the shirt was bunched up all on her arms and Glasses had to
sort that out with more teething and pulling.
>Which took quite a bit of time

>There was the usual assortment of sexy-skin contact during this.

>Glasses' bra against raven's stomach and chest.
>A tummy touch or two...
>It wasn't until she had the entire shirt fully over the head
that raven's plan became clear
>She was just biding her time
>Waiting
>Until Glasses had the shirt up past her elbows
>And raven leaned upwards and forwards at the exposed stomach
before her.
>RASPBERRY

>The girls fell into a giggling and laughing pile
>I had long released raven's legs so they kinda twirled and
attacked one another with a couple fits of tickles.
>Nothing is as fun as watching two attractive girls tickle
wrestle one another
>But like all good things, it had to come to an end.
>Eventually raven got up and glasses followed her.
>They're smiling
>I'm smiling
>They look down
>I realize they're both staring at the jeans i'm wearing
>The jeans that are doing nothing to hide the two individual
boner's i'm sprouting
>Like suns on tatooine, both shining brightly against the denim
sky.


I'm going to assume 4chan isnt going to be down for long and ill
write a tad more, but i can't promise ill start posting again.

>The girls don't seem to be angry or embarrassed though
>They just smile wider and devolve into giggling again
>Boners are usually Ok if the girls know they were being really
sexy.
>The dare has been completed, raven is once again topless along
with me.
>Her green T-Shirt on the floor along with mine.
>Couple problems though
>One, i had just proven the dares could be secret
>Two, i just set the precedent to allow one girl to undress
another, or me, or them
>Three, blondie had technically shown you could dare someone else
to do something to you.
>These were game changers in waggle room
>You could pretty much ask anyone do anything and it would happen
if you were clever enough
>That's dangerous
>Raven deals another hand
>I get awful cards
>Homely wins

>That dangerous thing i was talking about?
>That's Homely
>Every time she gets a dare, i lose
>She had me in her sights this time
>I could feel it
>She gets ready to speak
>"Birthday, i dare you to make out with Glasses for a full
minute"
>w... what
>Oh its revenge for trying to fuck with her earlier
>Sweet sweet revenge
>I guess i'm not involved
>Birthday just says she'll hold it.
>I guess she's not involved either
>Cards are dealt again
>Homely wins
>Oh shit

>"Birthday...
>"I dare you to go back to your room and go to sleep for the rest
of the evening"
>Homely's words are dripping with vengeance
>Fuck
>Thats harsh
>Make out with glasses (the current mortal enemy of birthday), or
go to bed.
>I stop them both though
>I point out that we didn't have any kind of limits on dares in
place, and that making a dare that lasts more than a minute or
two is kinda cruel
>Blondie adds her own opinion into the mix, that we should have a
dare committee or something.
>If you think a dare is really too over the top you can ask
everyone and they'll overturn it if the majority thinks it goes
too far.
>You always hope you don't have to police games of truth or dare,
but someone will intentionally abuse it every time if you dont.
>Homely crossed the line and we revoke the dare and tell her to
retry something else
>She's not phased at all though
>She's a natural at screwing people into doing things it seems.
>"Alright, I dare Birthday to Kiss Blondie for 2 minutes"
>lol
>fucking relentless

>First of all she was trying to punish blondie too now because
she revoked the first dare
>I find that funny
>Blondie doesn't find this funny however
>There's another objection
>"That's the same dare, or too close to the last one"
>Blondie is kinda right, you can't really allow that or else the
holding pile is pointless
>Otherwise you can just dare them to do the same thing twice with
different phrasing
>Dare #2 denied from Homely
>She's still got backups it seems
>This one gives her a huge grin
>I already don't like it
>"I Dare birthday to give Storybro her panties"
>I lied, i love it
>Birthday's wearing a skirt

>Step that game up to the max.

>Birthday initially looks worried
>That's definitely a dare meant to try to scare her into kissing
glasses.
>But then she warms up to the idea
>Seriously she turns that frown upside down.
>"Sure thing! Storybro come here"
>Oh man
>What
>Is kissing Glasses really that bad
>I guess so
>I liked kissing glasses though
>I'm going to have to re-evaluate my kissing metrics
>Score em on a curve, remove points when other women don't want
to kiss them.
>I get up, walk over to birthday's seat across the circle and
kneel down again
>Instead of her getting up or moving, she's still sitting with
her knees folded underneath her.
>Unless you want me to black magic those panties off you, you
better move your ass.
>Instead she beckons for me to get closer
>Fine, what do you want.
>She whispers in my ear
>"They're still in the laundry room, white basket"


>Ohh man i know the pair, alright fine
>I get up and walk away from the circle to the confusion of
everyone
>I get to the laundry room
>Tad bit of rummaging through wet clothes, towels and various
other garments we've discarded over the 2 days.
>I find the panties i took off her earlier, still as unclean as i
left them, albeit dried.
>I scrunch em into a ball in my fist and return to the group of
girls
>I'm met with looks of confusion
>I just hold my fist high in the air, bring one hand to it and
magically procure panties.
>Fuckin magic tricks man
>Nobody was that impressed with the magic trick
>But they were impressed with the panties
>Homely wasn't, she was irked
>"I meant the ones you were wearing!"
>Birthday just nods
>"Yeah i was wearing those earlier"
>Hahahaha
>These girls are boundless entertainment i keep thinking to
myself before sitting down and preparing for another round.
>Folding up the underwear and pocketing it.

>Wait a second
>What did she mean "STILL"
>WHAT DID SHE MEAN "WAS"
