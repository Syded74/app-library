**While The Fiancée is Away: A Taste Test Sequel.**
 **Summary:** Two and a half years after the events of Taste Test, Chloe and Beca are stupid in love and engaged to be married. Darla is still in their lives because she's an awesome sister and a good friend to Beca.
One day, while Chloe is away on a ten-day veterinary conference she FaceTimes Beca and can't help but notice her fiancée's agitation and horniness. So, she gives Beca permission to do something naughty with her twin.

"Babe, I'm going to miss you so much," Beca whined.
"I know sweetheart, but it's only ten days," Chloe kissed her pouting fiancée.
Beca sighed, "We've never been apart that long." It was true, despite being a music producer the longest Beca had ever been away from Chloe was eight days.
"I know," Chloe said softly "But, it's only going to be for a little while. Then I'll come home, drop everything, and spend the next couple of days snuggled up beside you."
Beca raised an eyebrow, "Naked Snuggling?"
"Hmmm, we'll see Becs" Chloe chuckled.
"Please," Beca scoffed. "You're insatiable."
"I can't help it. When I'm around you my body gets excited."
Beca snorted a laugh, "God you're such a weirdo."
"But I'm _your_ weirdo," the redhead leaned in for another kiss.
"True. I wouldn't have put a ring on it if your brand of weird wasn't something I could handle." Beca smiled.
Chloe leaned in close, brushing a strand of dark brown hair back before leaning in to whisper in her fiancé's ear, "I _never_ want you to get used to me. I want to be an unstoppable force that you don't fear. One that just the mere thought of me sends you into a tizzy."
Beca gulped. "You are."
Chloe pulled back, then smiled. "Good. I love you, baby."
Beca leaned up to kiss Chloe, "Love you too."
Chloe smiled into the kiss. The two women hugged each other like their life depended on it. One final embrace to tide them over until they see each other again.
"Besides," Chloe began once she broke the kiss, "You won't be all alone. You and Dar can hang out."
"Oh, joy" Beca rolled her eyes.
Her fiancée's twin was seldom around these days. With all three of their work schedules clashing it wasn't often they got to see each other. They do, however, frequently bump into Darla's stable of girl-toys in various states of undress parading around their house; Beca jokes that the redhead is turning their home into the Playboy Mansion. Because, like Beca, Darla identified as lesbian. It shocked Grace Beale, Darla and Chloe's mom, that both her daughters identified as queer women; Chloe being the pansexual one. She quickly came around to the notion and accepted her daughters, assuring them that nothing they did or said could ever make their momma love them any less.
"I heard that, Mitchell." Darla suddenly appeared. She was wearing an oversized T-shirt and nothing else save for her rainbow pride wristband. She frantically leaned into the refrigerator and was rummaging around for something.
"You okay Dar?" Chloe asked.
"Oh, I'm fine, but Jenny is hypoglycemic. I need a Gatorade or a Coke. Or, ugh, something."
Beca's eyes widened. "Dude, you fucked the sugar out of her?" she asked with a raised eyebrow, definitely impressed.
"Are you doubting my skills?"
"Never," Beca said.
"Play nice you two," Chloe teased, to which Darla and Beca rolled their eyes.
Chloe planted one final affectionate kiss on her fiancée's lips before she scurried out the door. "Be good and no touching yourself while I'm gone," she reminded the brunette.
Beca sighed. She was in for a long ten days.

Six days went by and Beca found herself missing her fiancée a little more each day. She found herself missing Chloe's voice, her smell, her body pressed against her own while they slept, oh man, definitely her body.
Yup, Beca missed that in every form.
Darla did her best to make sure her future sister-in-law was taking care of herself. Remembering to eat, not getting lost in her head. Hell, Beca even succumbed to playing _Scrabble_ with the redhead.
Her patience was thinner than usual today and a couple of junior producers and interns bore the brunt of it, which didn't sit well with Beca. So the brunette made a mental note to take them out to a fancy restaurant for lunch one day and pick up the tab.
The guilty thoughts went away as soon as Beca approached the garage door and swore she heard the faint sound of someone grunting.
She pushed the door open and...realized she probably shouldn't have.
Darla Beale was bent over on the kitchen island. Naked save for a red and black flannel shirt, while a woman with cropped blue hair and a nose ring thrust into her from behind.
"Who the fuck are you?" the unknown woman asked, looking at Beca then down at her partner who seemed surprised rather than confused.
Darla realized she wouldn't get her release unless she cleared things up, and, alright, it was probably the least she could do. "She's my sister's fiancée," she sighed. "Didn't expect you to be home this early," Darla looked up at Beca, who noted the disappointment and frustrated expression on her face.
Beca scratched the back of her head, "Yeah. Sorry," was all she could muster. Her eyes drifted down to the purple phallus between the stranger's legs, the one which just so happened to be buried deep inside her future sister-in-law and she couldn't help but clench her thighs together and not be reminded just how fucking horny she is right now. How keyed up she'd been for nearly an entire week.
It didn't help matters any when the feisty music producer realized Darla was getting fucked on the same counter that, despite her best efforts, Beca could not refrain from getting turned on every time she looked at. She remembered, quite vividly, what the three of them shared that night a couple of years ago on that counter. How the Beale twins played her body like a piano, fulfilling a carnal fantasy she never knew she had until it stared her right in the face. Beca still had the videos saved on her phone, and some nights, she'll be sitting in her office at the studio, looking over her shoulder to make sure nobody is watching her, even though it's _her_ office and nobody else is in there, and press the play button just to lose herself in the recollection _._
Moisture was pooling between her legs, and Beca knew she had to get out of that room and fast.
Annoyed, Darla looked over her shoulder and wiggled the lower half of her body, "Why did you stop? I didn't tell you to stop, Megan. Now grab my tits and fuck me like a proper lady!" she reminded her partner who sighed. Then upon quickly collecting her thoughts, she reached for Darla's breasts and resumed vigorously thrusting into the redhead.
"I'm just going to head upstairs," Beca said, "To my uhh bedroom," she quickly added, watching the redheads' nipples spill through the blue-haired woman's hands which were too small to properly cup them. The music producer knew she was enjoying the fuck, despite being devoid of intimacy or passion. Beca knew that was how Darla sometimes preferred her sex. Still, the brunette couldn't help but feel bad for her future sister-in-law. Darla deserved a special someone who could enrich her life physically, emotionally, and sexually; as Chloe did for Beca.
"Appreciate it," Darla said through gritted teeth and hooded eyes. "Unless you wanna stand there and watch us?" she smirked. But the brunette didn't hear Darla at first, she stood there, licking her lips before she caught herself.
Beca shook her head then scurried out of the kitchen past the cacophony of skin slapping and frenzied grunts of "oh, fuck" which filled the home until the brunette shut her bedroom door.
Once she made it to her bedroom, Beca slammed the door shut and pulled out her phone.
 _Beca_ : _Ugh. Your sister is getting fucked on our counter._
 _Chloe: Wow. Is it hot?_
 _Beca: ummm_
 _Chloe: Do you wish it was you bent over that counter getting fucked with reckless abandon? Sweat plastered to your temples, caked in sweat and sticking to the counter._
 _Beca: Fuck. This so isn't fair Chlo._
 _Chloe: If I'm stuck in horny jail then so are you. We gonna be cellmates, Mitchell! Lol_
 _Chloe: Then as a reward for being such a good girl I'd let you eat my pussy all night, and come in your mouth a thousand times._
 _Beca: My panties are ruined and I hate you._
 _Chloe: Same. And no u don't bby ily!_
 _Beca: Grr ily too_

After a rough night of tossing and turning the petite brunette shuffled down the stairs and into their kitchen. Today is a new day, and Beca was the master of her domain, or however the saying goes. From this point forward until Chloe comes home, it's a diet of brown rice, herbal tea, and nature hikes.
 **"** Morning," Darla said, barely paying attention while she fished through the refrigerator.
Beca hesitated for a moment, "Morning" she settled on. "You uhh, sleep okay?"
"Like a Snorlax," she smirked.
"Good," Beca said, awkwardly.
"Yeah. Oh and by the way, I totally returned the favor. It wasn't the most satisfying sexual encounter I've had on this counter nor was it the best pussy I've eaten," Darla winked.
Beca blushed. _Nature hikes and herbal tea_ , she reminded herself.
She wasn't getting horny.
Not horny at all.

Breakfast was delightful. Both women enjoyed a hearty helping of scrambled eggs.
Darla was washing dishes while Beca was sitting at the table scrolling through social media when the brunette's FaceTime app rang.
"Hey babe," Beca greeted warmly.
"Beca!" the redhead yelled out. "I've missed you so much!"
"Same, dude." Beca smiled. "How's the conference?" she asked.
"Boring. But what do you expect? At least I get to see cute little puppies and kitties," Chloe smiled.
"Lucky!"
"Oh, and an iguana which kinda reminded me of you. You know, broody and mysterious."
Beca rolled her eyes, "Thanks."
"So...miss me?" Chloe asked.
"I said I did," Beca said.
"No Beca. Do you _miss_ me, like my fingers and my mouth?"
"Um," Beca cleared her throat, "I mean, yeah, but I'll manage."
"Really?" Chloe raised an eyebrow incredulously. "Cause you seem tense."
"I'm not tense."
"No. She's just horny," Darla interjected, reminding both women she was in the room.
Chloe giggled.
"Ten days is a crap-ton of time to wait, Beale."
"Geez, if you're that restless then why don't you and Darla just fuck."
Beca immediately turned white as a ghost, she looked over at her wife's twin who was equally as surprised.
Deciding it was a joke (I mean it had to be, right?) Beca laughed it off.
"You're funny," the brunette said. She looked over at Darla to make sure she was chuckling.
She was not.
Instead, her expression presented something else.
 _Curiosity._
"I'm serious Beca. If you're horny and can't wait until I get home, then go ahead and fuck Darla."
"Are-Are you serious?" Beca asked.
"Of course I'm serious, babe. She's my twin. So it's not cheating because she looks exactly like me; not to mention we're like, linked intuitively. I promise this isn't one of those tests. I don't mind."
"It's just sex," Darla chimed in.
"Exactly!" Chloe eagerly agreed. "You and Darla used to hook up, so she knows your body well. What you like and how you like it, so of course I totes trust her with your sexual well-being."
"Uhh yeah maybe. We'll see what happens." Beca said.
"Okay. Well listen, babe, I've got to go. Love you."
"Love you too!" Beca said.
Chloe ended the FaceTime. A second later Beca felt a soft hand on her shoulder, "So whaddya say Mitchell, want me to rock your world?" her fiancée's twin whispered in her ear.
Beca backed up, and Darla immediately panicked.
"Oh my god. I'm so sorry," she said and the brunette instantly picked up on the worry laced in her voice.
"No. Umm, it's okay. You just caught me off guard is all."
Darla ushered Beca into one of the chairs in the kitchen, she made sure to look the younger woman in the eyes while she sat down right beside her. "Listen," she began, "We don't have to do anything you don't want to do, okay?"
Beca nodded.
"I'm serious Beca. If you're not comfortable with it, then the subject is dropped. You and I can spend the next couple of days getting caught up on Love Island. And I promise I'll respect your decision. You know I'm proud of you right?"
Beca raised an eyebrow.
"What I mean is that you're an amazing girlfriend to Chloe and there's nobody I'm more honored to call my sister-in-law than you."
"Aww thanks, Dar." Beca gave her an affectionate shove on the shoulder. "And look, I appreciate the concern. Let me think about it, okay? This is... like major."
"Yeah. Totally." The redhead smiled. "I'll be in the shower. Feel free to join me. If you don't then so be it. But I'll be pretty horny and I think I might wanna get one of my toys and fuck myself on this counter. So make yourself scarce once I get out of the shower."
Beca's cheeks flushed. She had a big decision to make.

Her hesitation didn't last long before Beca found herself shoved against the wall of her massive shower, watching a relentless redhead mount an attack on her soapy tits. Beca whimpered as Darla flicked then rolled her tongue over one nipple before switching to the other. They were getting reacquainted with each other's bodies after years apart and gone was much of the brunette's hesitation. She was fully committed to having sex with her fiancée's twin.
Beca was surprised to discover Darla sporting a couple of new tattoos, one being a massive Egyptian Ankh tattooed on the redhead's back. Egyptology had been an interest for Darla going back to her youth. The redhead also grew out her hair; nothing worthy of National Geographic, but a decent-sized patch nonetheless.
Darla guided Beca back to the stone bench which resided in the shower for _purely pragmatic_ reasons.
Totally non-sexual reasons.

Okay, totally sexual.
Beca specifically had a bench installed in her massive walk-in shower for the express purpose of having mind-blowing sex with Chloe without having to worry about nasty falls and the ensuing embarrassment of going to the hospital to have a sex injury treated.
Instead of getting down on her knees on the hard concrete, Darla opened the shower door to reach for a towel which she expertly folded, she then elected to sit cross-legged
Challenging the brunette with hungry eyes, she waited for permission to take things further. She wanted Beca to surrender herself.
"Please," the brunette begged.
"Please what? Be specific," the redhead teased
"Just fuck me. Use your tongue, or fingers, or whatever. Please, Darla, I need this."
Darla grinned, "So you wish it. So shall you receive."
The redhead slowly spread her companions' knees until they were wide open, she leaned in slowly and proceeded to press open-mouthed kisses along the inside of Beca's thighs.
The kissing went on for a couple of torturous minutes until Darla decided that Beca's waited long enough.
The redhead brought her face to the brunette's center and Beca could feel the warm puffs of breath. "Well, well, well, it has been a while hasn't it, old friend?" Darla said to the brunette's desperate dripping center, and Beca couldn't help but roll her eyes.
As soon as Beca felt her partner's warm tongue trace her clit for the first time, the music producer's phone rang.
FaceTime, _again._
"Ughh," Beca groaned.
Darla pulled her mouth away from the delicious treat she was feasting on, "Answer it. Might be important," then she dove back into her task.
Beca brushed a strand of red hair out of Darla's face. "You gonna st--op," the brunette moaned.
Darla cocked an eyebrow. A look which told Beca _What do you think?_
Scooting up on the bench, she scrambled towards her phone which was resting on the counter next to the shower. Darla seemed to move with her, unbothered by having to adjust her position because damned if she was going to stop doing what she was doing unless it was an emergency. Luckily the shower was so massive that neither of them was remotely near the stream of water.
"H-Hello," Beca appeared nude on Chloe's end.
"Oh my god! Are you guys doing it?" Chloe squealed.
Beca panted. "Yeah."
"I wanna see, Beca!" Chloe could barely contain her excitement. It threw the brunette off for a second, her fiancée eager, excited even, to watch her get her pussy eaten by someone else. Then, she suddenly remembered what the three of them shared in the past so the initial shock quickly dissolved.
Beca's finger shook as she struggled to push the button to "flip" the camera, finally succeeding after three tries.
"Beca! That is sooo hot. Oh my god," she watched enamored while her twin fucked her soon-to-be wife with her mouth.
"I'm sorry Chlo. I was so horny and-mmm- I just c-couldn't resist." Beca's chest heaved, somehow even more turned on now that Chloe was watching her get eaten out.
Chloe wiggled the lower half of her body while refusing to take her eyes away from Darla going down on Beca. Now she was incredibly horny, she kicked off her shorts. "Beca. It's alright babe. I told you I didn't mind if you guys fucked."
"You're-you're-," she took her free hand and fisted a handful of Darla's hair. Cueing her to speed up. "You're the best." she moaned. "Oh god. Right there."
"Do you like Darla eating your pussy?"
Beca nodded.
"Look how wet I am!" Chloe lowered the phone down until it hovered over her glistening center.
"Wow," Beca said.
"Show Darla," Beca flipped the camera again and Darla smirked into the brunette. Impressed with how wet Chloe's pussy was.
"Bec, Darla, can I--Is it okay with you two if I touch myself?"
Darla cocked her eyebrow in such a way that it gave Chloe the approval she needed.
Beca was hardly able to get her mouth to form words, but somehow she managed, "Yeah, yes."
She could tell the moment Chloe touched herself, she could hear it in the breathy moan Chloe let out.
"Beca," Chloe whimpered, trying desperately to keep ahold of her mind and keep a handle on her desire.
Beca moaned softly, "I'm here baby."
"You-You know, if I was there I'd swirl my tongue around your warm little pussy until you were a shaking mess. I'd flatten it more and more around each pass through until I had no choice but to suck and nip at your pretty little clit then I'd repeat myself over and over again until your body screamed for release."
Beca gasped when she felt Darla mimic Chloe's words, the woman acting as a conduit, a sex-puppet for her twin.
 _Is this a threesome?_
Chloe groaned, "Don't cum Beca. I want us both to cum together."
"I'm...I'm n-not gonna last m-much longer," she moaned.
"It's okay baby. I'm close too." Chloe said.
"I lo-ve you," Beca grunted.
"Love you too," Chloe strained. She applied one more little touch to her clit and it sent her over the edge. "Fuck, oh my god, now baby," the redhead arched her back.
"I'm cumming," Beca shouted. "Oh god. Oh shit," the brunette writhed under Darla's tongue, her brain forgetting to tell the rest of her body to breathe as her wetness filled the ginger's mouth.
"Man. That was intense," Chloe mumbled softly, trying her best to chuckle, which proved difficult since she could barely catch her breath.
A knock on Chloe's hotel room door brought the festivities to an abrupt halt. "Uh-oh! Gotta go it's room service," Beca heard the sounds of sheets rustle. Chloe must've been fumbling to put some clothes on. "Try to leave her in one piece for me Darla!" Chloe singsonged before abruptly ending the call.  
Beca looked down at the redhead and smiled. It warmed her heart when the smile was reciprocated and the other woman shifted her position.
"Amazing. I give it one Michelin Star," she wiped her mouth then rose to her feet.
"Only one?" Beca pouted, _playfully._
The redhead shrugged,
Beca stretched before finally scrambling to her feet. She walked over to the other end of the shower and proceeded to shut it off.
Once the shower was off Beca looked over her shoulder at her companion. "So where do we go from here?" she smiled.
Darla threw Beca a mischievous smirk, letting her know it was the question she thought she'd never ask.
The redhead pretended to mull it over.
"How about you tie me to my bed? I've got a new toy I've been saving for a special occasion."
"Will it improve my Michelin Star rating?" Beca asked cheekily.
Darla cocked an eyebrow, issuing a direct challenge to the brunette. "Maybe," she smiled deviously before sauntering away and leaving Beca fumbling. "Think you can make me squirt?"
Beca couldn't follow her fast enough.
