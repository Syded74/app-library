=======================================================

It all began last fall, during the high unemployment era, when we
were noticing quite a number of differences in our numbers. 
Finally, being unable to cope with these differences an auditing
team was assigned to locate the problem and offer recommendations
for correcting it.

It didn't take long for the auditors to discover not only the
problem, but what was causing the problem as well.  Simply put,
Jeff Cole was stealing.  Shocked wasn't the word for my reaction,
dumbfounded would be more like it.  Jeff has been a part of our
team for some time was well liked, didn't have any drinking or
social problems that we knew of and his work ethic was
outstanding, until now.

Since it's quite easy to fire someone, I generally like to
explore the possibility of fixing the situation first if at all
possible.  So Jeff was called in for an afternoon meeting.  At
the onset of the meeting I learned that Jeff's wife Denise had
lost her job and the family was suffering financially.  This then
was the problem that suddenly drove Jeff to steal.

Rather than confront him with his wrong doings at this time, I
told him that there might be an opportunity for a better
position, but that it would require some changes to his
lifestyle, but that the financial rewards would be far better
than his current position, and would he be interested.  He almost
leaped across the desk to shake my hand for considering him for
the opportunity.  I reminded him that this wasn't finalized by
any stretch, but I'd consider him for it.  He thanked me again,
and asked if there was anything he could do to sway me.  I told
him that since this would require a lifestyle change, I would
need to speak to and interview his wife regarding the position as
well.  Not a problem, when would I like to meet with Denise.

After a few phone calls a meeting was set for the next afternoon
at my club.  Denise would arrive at 1PM for a late lunch and we'd
discuss things.  I recalled Denise from some of the company
functions over the years.  She was in her early 40's, well
groomed, and while certainly not a super model, was indeed an
attractive woman who sometimes could turn heads.

Denise arrived promptly and was shown to my corner table away
from the thinning lunch crowd.  She was dressed in a conservative
skirt and blouse and as I remembered, nails, hair, makeup was
perfect.  I thanked her for coming and we immediately reviewed
the menu and placed our orders.

I then started to tell Denise about this opportunity for Jeff. 
The money would be about a 40% increase, though the downside was
the travel.  He would be away from home fully 2 to 3 weeks at a
time.   Denise said that this would present no problem and the
family could adjust.  I was then reminded that she was the Mother
of 2 boys.  One was away just started college and the other never
home anyway, as he was involved with all kinds of high school
activities.

We talked about finances and how the family was getting along now
that she was unemployed.  She admitted it was a struggle, but
they were managing to make ends meet.  Also, this opportunity
would certainly keep the wolf away from their door and if she
could find another job, well everything would be terrific.

After our dishes were cleared away, and coffee served, I began. 
Denise, I said, this is a private club, yet a public place, so
you are free to get up and walk out whenever you choose, because
I've some things to say to you that you may not appreciate. 
However, before you make any rash decisions, I would hope that
you would listen to everything that I have to say, then before
saying anything, think about what you are going to say.  Is that
fair enough?

Yes, was her somewhat suddenly nervous reply.  I opened my
briefcase and withdrew a stack of papers and placed them on the
table.  Taking the top one, I passed it to her to read.  The last
paragraph read, "In conclusion we are prepared to testify in a
court of law that employee, Mr. Jeffery Cole was the only person
involved with the theft of materials and cash totaling
$11,148.86.  Upon further investigation, we are of the opinion
that not only can Mr. Cole be prosecuted, but that full recovery
plus interest could be received through a civil proceeding
followed by the seizure and sale of his current home."

I don't believe this said Denise.  It has to be a joke or mistake
of some sort.  No, it's not I replied.  It's all quite true, and
this stack of papers here is the supporting evidence should you
really want to take the time to read it.  But our home....her
voice trailed off.

Denise, there is more here, and an opportunity, but the decision
will be entirely up to you.  What do you mean, she asked. 
Whether or not Jeff gets promoted, whether or not I don't call
the police, whether or not I don't file a civil suit to recover
my funds, all depends on you.  Me, I don't understand, she said.


Well, I'll explain, I said, and I remind you that we are in a
public place and you are free to leave at anytime.  Should you
walk out, I'll consider that to be a rejection.  Should you stay
and hear me out, then I'll give you till tomorrow afternoon to
consider and give me your answer.  Should you answer in the
affirmative, then all these papers will be locked away in my
personal office safe.  Should you answer no, then I'll take
whatever steps necessary to proceed.  Do you understand me?  Yes
she mumbled.

Denise, I began, I thought you a very attractive mature woman on
the different occasions I've seen you, and this situation your
husband managed to get into was certainly not my doing.  However,
I fully understand his circumstances, but do not condone it.  So,
regardless of my feelings, the company must be made whole and now
I'm offering a way for this to happen.

What, Denise said, I don't quite understand.  What does it have
to do with me?  Simple Denise, I'll promote Jeff which will give
you more income to live on and stop this stealing.  Also, as Jeff
will be out of town and your son's, as you've said, are away
there won't be any pressure from home.  I'll take care of curing
the companies loss and you in turn will make yourself available
to me, for shall we say discreet encounters.

WHAT, she almost screamed...you want me to...  Yes, you got it, I
said.  But before you over react, stop and consider the complete
package.  Agree and life goes on.  Refuse, and well Jeff will be
in a whole heap of trouble, plus you'll lose your house, college
for the oldest may be a problem and high school can certainly be
brutal for kids when a parent is serving prison time.  Now, don't
say a word, I suggested.  Go home, think it over and let me know
something by 5PM tomorrow afternoon.

Without saying a word, Denise pushed back from the table, turned
and walked out of the dining room.  I signed for the check, and
returned to the office for the rest of the afternoon.  Heading
out the door at the end of the day, I caught up with Jeff and
told him that I was working on the details, and that I would have
an answer for him no later than 5PM-tomorrow afternoon.  He
thanked me and said he'd let Denise know that evening.

When Jeff got home Denise was preparing dinner.  Jeff came up
behind her and reach around grabbing her tits, and whispered in
her ear, I think I've got the promotion.  Said, he'll let me know
one way or the other by tomorrow at 5.  Denise shuttered at being
reminded of the time schedule, and continued with making dinner.


That evening as they sat watching TV Denise asked, Do you think
I'm sexy?  Without a doubt, Jeff replied.  Any man would give his
eyeteeth for you, and he reached to move his hand between her
legs.  No, I'm serious Jeff.   What are you getting at, he asked.
 I mean, look at you, you have a nice figure, and certainly a
beautiful face and smile, plus a great personality.   Really,
asked Denise, I'm not 21 any more.  No, you're twice that, said
Jeff, and a lot better for it too.  Besides if you were 21 you'd
probably kill me in bed, joked Jeff.  Well that's a thought,
replied Denise, tonight we'll see how the old man does.

Their night of lovemaking was the usual between the two of them
after 20+ years of marriage.  Jeff rolled over to her and began
squeezing her breasts, then shortly grasped her hand guiding it
to his cock, which she began massaging.  A few kisses and he
slipped his fingers into her, then in short order mounted her and
began pounding away.

As his cock was moving in an out of her pussy, Denise could only
wonder about what had happened that afternoon, the impact of it
all, and finally, how she could ever be with another man.  A
shutter ran through her body, which Jeff took for her climax and
was followed seconds later by his very own.

Denise didn't sleep that night, she just couldn't get her mind to
relax and stop thinking about the proposal.  How could she, what
would she have to do, when, where, how often and behind it all,
what would it be like.  Finally she got up and went to the
bathroom and viewed herself in the mirror.

Yes, she thought, I do have an infectious smile.  Then looking
down she studied her breasts.  She certainly matured since 21 she
thought; though I haven't faired to poorly.  She lifted her tits
and examined her nipples and cleavage in the mirror.  Yes, I'm
sure any number of men would like to play with and suck on these
puppies she thought.

As her hands move lower passing over her stomach and onto her
abdomen she observed no washboard hardness like when she was 21,
but now she was 42, the mother of 2, yet all things considered,
she was for the most part able to boast of a flat stomach.

Moving still lower she allowed her fingers to move through her
natural bush and touch the top of her slit.  No, no I can't go
there, I've got to get some sleep, I need to think about this. 
Returning to their bed, Jeff was snoring softly and Denise tried
to relax and get some sleep.

In the morning Jeff dressed quietly while Denise slept and left
more nervous than ever for work.  He'd know today whether or not
he got the promotion.  Oh, it required a lot of traveling and
he'd be away from home two to three weeks at a time, but the
money more than made up for the at home time.  After all, the
boys were gone for the most part, and while Denise was a
wonderful wife, their sex life was down to once or twice a month,
so yes, this promotion would be great.  Also, if he could somehow
manage to figure out how to replay for some of the things he's
taken from the company, that would also help him sleep better as
well.  Meanwhile though, just hope for the best.

Denise woke about 10, and started off with her normal shower,
followed by coffee and the morning newspaper looking at the
classified's.  The clock continued to advance, and she knew she
needed to make a decision.  But what, say no thank you, lose
Jeff, the house and maybe even the boys, or say yes and lose her
self-respect.  How could Jeff do this to her....what was she to
do?

Over and over Denise tried to think of a way out and if not, then
what to do, but always came back to the same answer, she must
agree to the terms.

At 1:45 that afternoon my phone rang, and Denise was on the line.
 I'll agree she said, but 2 things.  What, I asked.  You'll never
tell Jeff, and no pain, you won't hurt me.  Neither is an issue I
replied, so don't worry.  Okay then, she said, I agree.  Her
voice sounded like the weight of the world was lifted from her
shoulders.  I said, okay, so we understand one another, you're
agreeing to make yourself available to me while Jeff is away and
will do as I tell you without argument.  Else I'll open my safe
and ....  Yes, yes I agree she said.
Good I said, I'll start the paperwork for Jeff and let him know
of his promotion.

I called Jeff on his extension an informed him of the decision to
promote him.   He thanked me and promised that I wouldn't be
disappointed by having made the decision.  I certainly didn't
think so, I said to myself.

The week finished up and Jeff was scheduled to leave Monday
morning early for his first trip into the field.  I too was ready
for my first, but it would be with Denise.   At 945 Monday
morning I phoned her.  Denise, good morning, I said.  Good
morning she replied politely.  Jeff is on his way as we speak, so
I'd like for you to come to my house this afternoon, say about 3,
will that be okay?   I could hear a quiet somewhat muffled yes
through the earpiece.   What do you want me to wear, she asked. 
Dress, skirt, doesn't matter, but the only no no is pantyhose, I
hate that, I said, oh and I'll leave the garage door open for
you, so you can park the car out of site.
