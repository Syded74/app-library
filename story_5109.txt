Virginia Homewood

Starlight flashed around us then we were surrounded by trees.

Spooky, haunted, bent, and warped trees. The bark was so dark it was almost black. The branches twisted over our heads like skeletal hands reaching to rend our faces. The entire place held an atmosphere of pain and despair. I shuddered as I looked around.

Lada, Akane, and their cheerleaders and volleyball team were arrayed around me in a protective arc. The Demon Lord's castle lay beyond these tortured woods. We were close. So close to where my Saffron was hidden. 

I could feel her nearby. I just wanted to shout out her name. To let her know I was here. That she didn't have to worry. But we had to wait for Ella to bring everyone in. The redheaded futa-heroine flashed me a wink. Then she slashed at the ground around her with her starmetal blade Ekana. 

She plunged into the hole she made. The ground appearing whole and unblemished the second she was clear. It was a strange weapon she had, befitting my fellow futa-heroine. A nervous energy brimmed in the air as I looked around.

“We'll get her back, Mistress Virginia,” Chipmunk said. She had lost her squirrel tail. She had an important mission. Now wasn't the time to play games. 

I cupped the dark elf's midnight-black skin, her white hair gathered in a graceful ponytail. “We will.” 

I kissed her, feeling the warmth of her lips, savoring the pleasure of this moment. I was glad to have her here. So glad all my harem and Ella's were coming. Light flashed and the futa-teachers appeared, naked and ready to cast their magic. 

I broke the kiss with Chipmunk and nodded to them as they fanned out to take their positions. Ella vanished to fetch the next group. I glanced at Kali. My futa-elf-angel held her bow in hand but had no arrows. Now that she had ascended, she didn't need arrows. I wasn't sure what she would be firing, but it would be spectacular.

Brígida and her mages came next, then Aria and her priestess along with Willow. My futa-dryad waved to me. Then she looked around and shook her head. These trees must be horrible if she looked like that. Would the plan still work?

“I can do it, Lady Virginia,” Willow said. “I have to be brave as everyone else in the harem. I can't let fear hold me back.”

I nodded, smiling at her. 

Last came the drama club. They were now priestesses of the Seven Harmonious Goddesses. I swallowed as Ella marched up. Chipmunk rolled her shoulders. A shadowy blade appeared in her hands. The slender dark elf looked like a gymnast. 

“Just put me right where I told you to,” said Chipmunk. She had actually been in the castle. 

“You sure?” Ella asked, glancing at me. 

“I'm risking my life for my owner,” Chipmunk said with such conviction. “Now put me in there! I will do my duty!”

I couldn't do it all on my own. Others had earned the right to risk their lives, too. I nodded.

The starmetal blade slashed, a blur of motion. Chipmunk dropped out of the world. My heart clenched. There was no going back now. It was time to take on the Demon Lord and end her threat to this world.

“Ella, Lada, Akane, lead them out!” I cried. “Brígida and Mrs. Webb, ready to support them. You all know the plan. Now we just have to execute it!”

My harem cheered. 

I hoped this would work. I prayed that this would work. It had to. Saffron was in that terrible place. Alone. At the mercy of that horrible cunt. This had to work out. I had to hold her in my arms once more. I would save my twin sister.

Saffron Homewood

“She's here,” Evil Me said. She crossed her legs, quivering with delight. 

I smiled. “You really think you're going to crush her with despair. But you forget, she's a way better person than me, let alone Shitty Me: The Emo Bitch Years Edition. Trademark, of course. All rights reserved, yada, yada, yada.”

“Such flippancy,” said Aria. “Mmm, I am going to treasure watching you suffer.”

I flipped her off. “You three nut bags need to shut it. God, I know I'm pathetic, but what's your excuse for joining the crazy train. All three of you are fucking smarter than me.”

“Oh, you know, a little torture between friends,” Shitty Me: The Emo Bitch Years Edition (trademark) said. She laughed, a cackle of mad despair.

I rolled my eyes. “Probably practice that laugh for weeks to get it just right. God, I have to make some serious life choices.”

Fear churned in my stomach. How would Virginia take to watching Shitty Me kill Awesome Me (that would be me me) before her eyes? I don't know. Hopefully better than I did because... I didn't see how she could save me before Cunty Me slit my pristine and gorgeous throat.

Don't lose yourself, I prayed. Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. I always knew I was the fucked up one. I suppose getting killed by myself was sort of inevitable. I just thought it would be driving a car like a maniac or climbing K2 butt naked. 

I don't know if she heard me, but I felt better. At peace. Virginia was stronger than me. She would cry, but the Non-Shitty versions of our friends would be there to help her. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lada Volkov

I marched out of the skeletal trees, Akane and Ella to my right. Behind us, came my kick-ass cheer squad and the sexy volleyball babes. We were armed and armored. A hundred yards away, across football-field lengths of rocky ground, the black curtain walls of the castle rose before us.

The castle had a wet gleam to it. Something red had been dumped down the sides. I shuddered as the horrible reek of blood filled the air. The toothy things on the walls, the battlements or whatever, had spikes with skulls on them. Standing on them were the devils. They were red-skinned and horned bitches with fire burning in their hands. In the air, black-skinned harpies flew with leathery wings and white hair.

They had pointed ears like they were dark elves once or something.

On the ground were the lemures. They were all black, hairless cunts with sharp claws and mouths full of slathering fangs. They snarled at the sight of us. They clawed the ground. All of them wore iron chastity belts. I shook my head in disgust.

“You think we're going to stand for that shit!” I shouted. “Those poor demon girls can't even fuck. Look at them. They're seeing all our big dick and tight cunts and they can’t enjoy them. So they're going to be pissed off. They're going to rip us apart. Are we going to let them?”

“NOOOO!” my cheer squad yelled.

“We're the soldiers of the Queen Bee herself. Queenie Virginia loves us all, and we're not going to let her down!”

“No, we're not,” Ella said, her starmetal blade in hand.

“So we're going to show these horny, frustrated demon-bitches how the schoolgirls of St. Mary of the Veil deals with losers like them!” I leveled my sword. “Let's fuck them up. FOR OUR QUEEN!”

“QUEEN VIRGINIA!”

I charged at the lemures, Ella running at my side, Akane beyond her, graceful as ever. My legs carried me across the broken ground. The strength and vigor that Virginia had poured into my body carried me towards the enemy. I would not falter. I would not flag. I would show those fucking cunts that we mean business.

The lemures roared and charged at us. From the walls, the red-skinned devils threw their fire. Balls of flame arched out and hurtled down at us. The harpies shrieked and threw their shadow daggers. Three different ways to die rushed at us.

“FOR OUR QUEEN!”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Brígida Vasquez

“Gaa Dakap!” I cried.

“GAA DAKAP!” my futa-mages (and one futa-witch) cried, throwing out our magic to the fireballs hurtling down at Lada, Ella, Akane, and their girls.

Our magic slammed into the fire and snuffed out the flames. They winked out before they could burst amid those I loved and cause untold misery and suffering. I grinned in delight, Lada and the others running as fast as they could.

Mrs. Webb pointed her finger at the harpies on the wall. “Eenahsor Enaalid!”

A beam of light shot from her finger and struck a winged bitch in the chest.

“Uyaav Enaalid!” Ms. Hailey cried.

“Gaa Enaalid!” chanted Mrs. Bean.

“Jaag Eeahir!” bellowed Mrs. Bagley.

Blades of air, balls of fire, and lightning bolts shot into the skies and burst amid the harpies. One was cut in half. Another fell burning to the ground. Lightning crackled amid them. I itched to join them, but another volley of fire launched from the battlements.

“GAA DAKAP!” my girls and I cried. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Willow

I found the mightiest of the twisted dark oaks. The cruel impulses burning from her made me shiver, but I wouldn't relent. I had a mission. I had to be brave. I had to overcome my fear. No more hiding. No more cowering.

Dryad, you mewling cunt, you think that timid touch will do anything for me, the dark-hearted oak growled. You want me to serve you? I will rip you apart with my branches and water my roots with your blood!

 I flinched.

Her laughter boomed in my mind, mocking me. Run along, Dryad. Find a supple willow or quivering birch to stick your cock in. You thrust it into me, and I'll rip it off!

I wanted to run away, but I couldn't. My futa-heroine had given me this mission.

You will be lucky to have my cock fucking you, Oak! I thought. I stroked her trunk. Show me that pussy. I'll fuck you so hard and make you quiver in delight. 

You, little dryad. You quiver like a sapling in a storm.

No! You'll be trembling like an oak tree in spring. I'll fuck you so hard. I'll ram my dryad-dick into your tree-cunt and make you quiver. You will feel my seed burst into you and squeal in delight. Open that pussy NOW! 

The tree laughed again.

I pressed my cock right against her bark, feeling the rough texture. You open that pussy right now, or I will go and get an ax and cut you down!

Bold. The tree's branches rustled with her glee. You would really harm a tree.

Yes, you cruel cunt! Now open that pussy and let me fuck you!”

The bark parted. I thrust into the cruel oak tree's pussy. I would fuck her so hard. I would awaken her with my seed. I would not fail Lady Virginia. This tree would serve her and be happy about it. I hugged her tight, her bark rough on my nipples, and loved her. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lada Volkov

I crashed into the lemures, the others right behind me.

The demonic monster girls hissed and slashed with their claws. I swung my sword, hacking into the first one, cutting her down. Her blood splattered my bronze wood armor. I didn't care. I was fighting for Lady Virginia.

Ella's starmetal blade slashed effortlessly through the monsters, sending parts flying. I blocked a slash of claws as I swung. Up and down the line, cheerleaders and volleyball babes fought. My girls shouted their war cry.

“QUEEN VIRGINIA!”

I thrust my sword, taking a lemure in the belly.
 
Shadow daggers slashed down at us. Spells burst in the sky overhead. Fireballs snuffed out. The plan was working. I just had to keep fighting. Keep hacking. I cut another down, my heart pounding with such exhilaration.

“I am Lady Virginia's kick-ass captain!” I shouted. “Come get me, demon-bitches!”

Three black-skinned lemures hissed in answer and jumped at me. One slashed, striking my breastplate and scratching down the armor. My sword swung, cutting off the head of the second demon. It spun through the air.

The third slashed into my thigh. Pain ripped through my leg. Blood spurted. I screamed in pain and thrust my sword. I buried my blade into her throat, cutting into her spine. She gurgled as she died. The first hissed and slashed at me again.

I blocked and stepped forward to attack only for my wound leg to fold. I gasped and collapsed on my back. More blood spurted from the wound. The first lemure hissed in delight, her eyes wild with bloodlust.

“I can taste your soul!” she snarled and threw herself on me.

She slammed my sword arm down to the ground, her body on me. I threw a punch with my left arm. She blocked it with her forearm. Her mouth widened. Cruel, needle-sharp teeth gleamed. She plunged for my throat.

“I hope you choke on my soul!” I screamed.

Something flashed. The demon's head flew off and her body fell on mine. Suzan stood there, my cheerleader smiling down at me. I groaned and heaved the corpse off, panting. I was alive. I would get to keep fighting for Queen Virginia

Only the world spun around me. A cold swept through me. Suzan gasped as she stared at the blood gushing from my leg. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aria Dennell

I clutched at my pregnant belly as I stared out at the fight. Virginia was beside me, fretting. Kali, on the other side of my futa-wife, fired her bow. Arrows of golden light shot into the air and struck another of the harpies. She spiraled down and hit the ground hard. 

I gazed out at the battlefield. I watched the ebb and flow. It was getting worse. I spotted Lada going down. Suzan stood over her, but I could tell something was wrong. The first severe injury. Before Suzan even made the signal, I acted.

“Tamera, get out there and heal Lada!” I cried. 

My roommate, the first of my futa-priestess I had blessed with the power that Virginia had given me, launched into motion. She charged out into the battlefield to go and help Lada. She raced out alone, and the harpies saw her.

Fireballs burst in the sky. Daggers rained down. The futa-teachers threw their spells, but there were so many of the black-skinned, winged demons flying in the air. Tamera was all alone as she made her run. I clasped my hands together.

“Taari, Goddess of the Night and Mistress of Secrets, I beseech you to ward your priestess. Keep Tamera safe in the fight against the Demon Lord.”

Power surged through me. A shield of darkness appeared, blocking a shadowy knife from plunging into my Tamera.

I let out such a sigh of relief. She had not been killed. But that didn't mean she was out of danger. The forces arrayed against her were powerful. I drew in a steeling breath as more of the defenders fell. Tamera reached Lada, but others needed my priestesses' help.

And they ran out with love in their hearts to aid them.

I examined the battlefield. The attack faltered. The wounded piled up fast. The lemures were falling, too, but there were reserves. Another wave of them waited to charge in as my priestesses began casting their healing magic, vulnerable while they worked.

“Brígida, I need a barricade!” Aria cried. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Brígida Vasquez

“You heard her!” I shouted, pushing up my glasses. “Let's make a wall, mamacitas!” 

My futa-mages (and one futa-witch) all concentrated on the attackers. The second wave of Lemures charged. We had to buy the priestesses a few precious seconds to work their magic. We could not let our fellows fall to the dangers.

“IMOOHB REHPAREH!” I cried with my awesome cadre of magic users.

The power surged out in concert from us. Bursting out of the ground in a circle that reached back before the castle was a wall of stone. It erupted from the ground before the wounded defenders and those still fighting the last few lemures of the first wave. Thrusting fifteen feet in the air, dirt spilled off it as it trapped the second wave behind it.

“And back to snuffing out those fireballs!” I cried, a volley of them hurtling down at the defenders. “Gaa Dakap!”

“GAA DAKAP!”

The harpies dived at the wounded and the priestesses as the fireballs thrown by the devils unraveled. Spells fired from Mrs. Webb and her teacher cadre of futa-mages. They tinned them, but there were so many of them. 

And more fireballs hurtled down that had to be unraveled. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kalirisia

The harpies dived down at the wounded and the priestesses sheltering behind the wall.

Virginia quivered in fear beside me as I drew back my bow. A golden arrow sprang into existence. I loosed the moment the string touched my cheek. The arrow shot forward as I drew again. And again. And again.

Five of them hurtled through the air before the first one hit the lead harpy. Golden light burst from the demonic bitch. She screamed as she spun through the air, plunging for the ground below. Then a second. A third. A fourth.

I kept firing, killing them as they swooped down at them. Spells hit the harpies, too. Fireballs and lightning bolts crashed into them. A priestess was hit. Evelyn fell on the ground, but Tamera ran over to her. Lada cut down a harpy going for the priestess.

Clawed hands appeared at the top of the wall. Lemures poured over it and dropped down on the defenders still recovering from the first wave. Ella was there, her blade hacking through the enemy. Lada and Akane at her side.

Fear spilled through me. There were so many forces. In moments, a flood of lemures jumped down to attack the defenders. The wall of stone crumbled away, the magic sustaining it expended. It had done its purpose.

But had it purchased enough time for the attackers to survive?

I didn't know. All I could do was draw back my bow and fire my arrows. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lada Volkov

I slashed at the lemures that leaped down from the wall, cutting into them. Tamera had healed me enough. My thigh throbbed, but I could still fight for Queen Virginia. There were still girls down. The priestesses were in danger now, too.

I battled before Tamera, slashing and hacking at the lemures, killing them before they could get to the priestesses still healing behind me. I roared as I hacked and slashed. My blade buried into the enemy again and again.

“QUEEN VIRGINIA!” roared up and down the line.

I was so proud of my girls. My cheerleaders were fighting so hard to protect the priestess. The harem. We were fighting to rescue Saffron. To have that happily ever after that Virginia deserved. I loved them both. 

I wanted them to be together in all their twincest glory. 

Blood spurted as I killed the enemy. They died in their chastity belts, slathering for my blood. My leg hurt, but I didn't care. It was nothing. So long as Saffron was imprisoned, then we weren't a complete family. We had a big hole that needed filling.

And I would help fill it.

Claws scraped down my armor. I slashed with my sword, tacking off the demon bitch's head. I blocked another set of claws. Teeth snapped for my throat. I jumped back and hacked, cutting a nasty wound through the enemy.

More of my women were back up and in the fight. Ocean and Ejiro tag-teamed one. Suzan and Mackenzie fought side by side, looking so hot as they fought. Ella's blade flashed, carving death wherever she went.

A roar sounded from above.

I looked up to see a terrifying beast. A pit fiend on leathery wings. Not as big as the one that had almost killed Saffron. It had taken all the futa-mages last time to kill that one. But this one still looked nasty. She swooped down at us and breathed fire. The heat washed at me as the flames engulfed my girls and priestess alike.

The pit fiend soared over, laughing in delight as she left carnage in her wake. My stomach churned at the disgusting scents that filled the air. Suzan screamed as she collapsed. Burned cheerleaders and priestesses lay screaming on the ground.

My stomach boiled.

“Let's go!” Tamera shouted. “Move! Move!”

“Come on, ladies!” cried Giuliana from the drama club as rushed over with the other healers. They fell to their knees to start praying.

“Save them!” I cried, my stomach churning in horror.

And the pit fiend banked around for another devastating pass. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virginia Homewood

“I need something to take care of the pit fiend!” I cried. 

The Golden Power rushed out of me. The sky opened up. A chorus of angels sang. Their music washed over the world as three of them burst out of the hole. Their white wings spread wide. Swords of gold in hand. I smiled at the sight of the surging down at the terrible demon.

They crashed into the pit fiend. The beast snarled as they hacked at her. They cut the monster, driving her towards the ground. They swarmed over the monster, their blades swinging and slicing. They dealt it blow after blow.

I smiled. I recognized the angels as among those who I pleasured. Their song surged with triumph as they hacked off the pit fiend's wings. The demon plunged to the ground and they followed, burying their swords into the dying demon's body.

I smiled. The harpies were all but dead. The lemures faltering. The battle had shifted into our favor. I drew in a deep breath. That was what I wanted. What I had hoped for. It was wonderful to see that we were making progress.

The walls still stood. More devils manned it. Their fireballs still snuffed out as Brígida and her futa-mages cried out. I hoped they didn't go hoarse. This wasn't over yet. This was only getting started. 

“Brígida, send the signal!” 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Brígida Vasquez

“Finally,” I said, eager for the next part to go. 

I drew in a deep breath, focusing on the spell and where I needed to go.

“EENAHSOR DAKAP!” I cried.

Above the courtyard of the Demon Lord's castle, a bright ball of blue light shone. I nodded at that then focused my attention on the devils on the walls. We had to start doing something about those. The last of the harpies fell, picked off by Kali's arrows.

I pointed my fingers. “Arehdna Enaalid!”

Awash of shadows hurtled across the battlefield and struck the wall. The darkness spilled over the battlements and swept back a group of the defenders, disrupting the fireballs they threw. Other spells followed, thrown by the futa-teachers. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chipmunk

Blue light flooded in through the gap in the doorway of storeroom I hid in. An armory that held spiked weapons and crates of rancid meat, the food of the devils guarding the gatehouse. I conjured my shadowy dagger and flowed to the door.

I opened it and sprang into action.

My first thrown dagger took a devil in the throat. The look of cow-dull surprise on her face surged a vicious streak of bloodlust. I hadn't murdered in a while. I was good at it. My wrist already flicked, throwing out the second and third shadowy daggers, taking another in the throat and on in the eye.

“Assassin!” snarled a devil. There were ten of them still alive in the gatehouse.

They rushed at me. A rusty sword slashed down at me. I caught it between my hands. My foot lashed out, kicking her in the stomach. She flew back into two more, knocking them down. I spun the sword in the air, caught it by the hilt, and slashed.

Blood spurted from a severed throat.

My shadowy dagger appeared in my left hand. I threw three of them as I danced through the room. Their blades swung too slow to hit me. I surged through them, laughing in delight. My silvery hair flowed behind me as I left them all dead on the ground.

I panted, coming to a stop. They all were on the ground, trembling, moaning. I reveled in killing them. It was such a glorious thing to do. I rolled my shoulders and panted, such exhilaration flowing through my body. 

With those dead, I went to the heavy wheel attached to a system of thick ropes and pulleys. I started turning it, raising the portcullis that guarded the entrance into the Demon Lord's castle. This would let Lada, Ella, Akane, and their girls flow into the inner bailey and started securing the keep itself. 

That was where we would find Saffron.

A loud snarl snapped my gaze to the open door into the room. I stared out into the bailey to see a wave of heat. A haze. Then there was a huge force of lemures and hellhounds that surged now for the open gate. A counter-attack to flood out into the defenders. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lada Volkov

“There's the portcullis!” I cried, the priestesses healing the burned. They were working fast, chanting with all their fervor. “Let's go!”

I rushed to the entrance and slid to a stop. A horde of lemures and these big, red dogs with flames spilling out of their mouths charged towards us. They howled as they poured into the gate, funneled by the narrow opening. 

My girls formed up around us. Ella is at the center. I held the left, Akane the right. Suzan fell in beside me, her armor scorched, but she was whole and hale.

“For Queen Virginia!” I howled, raising my sword high.

Behind us, the ground shook. I smiled as something big and hulking raced at us. A shadow passed over us. A massive, gnarled tree landed before us. Willow sat perched in the eaves, one arm around the trunk. A hole leaked white cum.

The tree slammed its mighty branches into the first lemures and hellhounds that ran out. The branches broke bodies and flung them away. I laughed in delight as the tree marched into the tunnel. Screams echoed out. 

“Follow!” I cried and rushed in after the tree. “It's cleared the path! Let's go!”

Magic exploded across the tops of the walls as we surged into the gate after the demonic tree. Willow looked so elegant riding along in the branches. A carpet of dead bodies littered the way in, the demons massacred by the tree's passion.

The tree crashed out into the courtyard. The skeletal branches crashed into a horde of hellhounds, hurtling them into devils. Ella crashed into the enemies at the head of us, her sword swinging. Chipmunk flowed out of a door, her daggers flying through the air.

“QUEEN VIRGINIA!” I yelled as I threw myself into the enemy. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virginia Homewood

“That's it!” I cried as the priestesses ran in after the cheerleaders and volleyball babes. I burst out of the woods, the futa-mages and futa-witches running with us.

Only Aria hung back.

Kali flapped her wings, taking to the stage as I hurried across the battlefield. I had such energy. I needed to get us all over there. Golden Power surged around us. We blinked across the battlefield into the gore-splattered gate.

The tree killed. The cheerleaders hacked into the enemies on the left, the volleyball babes on the right. Ella darted around, protecting all she could. Priestesses were praying to the Seven Harmonious Goddesses to heal wounds and protect my harem.

“QUEEN VIRGINIA!”

Their cries made me smile. They fought for me and for my twin sister.

A loud rumble split the courtyard. A black, spectral energy sprang up around the castle. A piercing wail, the screams of a thousand damned souls, howled around us. I gasped, clamping hands over my ears. Everyone around me staggered from the screech.

The monsters were only emboldened. They charged at my attackers as they reeled. Ella recovered first. Her sword sang, killing a hellhound lunging for Ejiro. Then she darted to the right and saved Guiyang from being killed.

I swallowed, staring at the energy. 

“Gaa Enaalid!” Brígida shouted from nearby. She threw a ball of magical fire that consumed three lemures.

“Jaag Enaalid!” cried Mrs. Webb. A crackling ball of lightning crashed into a pack of hellhounds. They snarled as they trembled.

“Eenahsor Enaalid!” Addy cried. The self-styled futa-witch fired a beam of light that seared off the head of a lemure about to tear claws into Tamera.

“Thanks!” Tamera cried.

“Natsi, Goddess of the Breasts, Mistress of Healing, I beseech you!” chanted Nevada, one of the drama club girls. “From the breast comes the milk of life, the first meal of a baby. Whole and unblemished, let Méline's flesh remember that state and be mended!”

Méline, her stomach ripped open, gasped out in her delightful, French accent as she was healed, though the shattered breastplate wasn't mended. She picked up her sword and charged back into the fray, slamming her blade into the chest of a hellhound.

I swallowed at the destruction. My girls were driving them back. Willow guided her oak tree into a group of lemures, scattering them with battering blows. On her flanks, Koharu, Bryanna, and Mary Jo slashed their swords. The volleyball babes finished off the survivors.

“Arehdna Enaalid!” Mrs. Bean called, slamming darkness into a devil, throwing the red-skinned demon back into a pack of hellhounds who were then hurt by the darkness.

“Jaag Eeahir!” Sylvie shouted. A lightning bolt struck one of the few harpies still in the air. 

The battle split on either side of me, clearing a path to the front of the keep protected by the shadows. I swallowed, heading towards it. My sister was in there. I had to get to her. I moved towards it, my heart racing.

Kali's bow twanged as she fired.

Chipmunk's shadowy daggers flew through the air, hitting the throats of lemures. 
The chants of priestess, the arcane words of the mages, the battle cries of the warriors all filled the air as I came closer and closer to the front door. A dreadful chill washed over me. This power surging up into the air was pure evil.

“Virginia!”

Saffron's voice cried to me. I gasped, feeling her just on the other side of it. I reached out my hand, marching forward. I needed to save my Saffron. My twin sister had to be rescued. I would not let the Demon Lord kill her.

“Please, you have to save me, Virginia!” Saffron cried. “This skanky bitch is going to cut my throat. That would be so not cool. How am I supposed to fuck you if I'm bleeding to death? She's such a cunt! Ugh, come and defeat her already, Virginia!”

I smiled for a moment. That was my sister. I just had to—

“Virginia!” Aria cried. She grabbed me and spun me around. I came face to face with my pregnant futa-priestess. Her multitude of beaded braids clicked and clattered. There was such worry in her chocolate face. “What are you doing?”

“Saffron's in there all alone,” I said. “I have to get to her!”

I jerked my arm from Aria's grasps and turned to the keep. I shoved my hand against the barrier. I gasped at the power of evil that emanated from the other side. A chill rippled through me. A profound fear fell on me. This was something terrifying.

Something that would rend my soul. It was so dangerous for me to be here, but I had to save her.

“That should have killed you,” Aria said. “I can feel the power of pure evil. That's not just the Three Chaotic Goddesses. That's her power. The Demon Lord.”

“I know,” I said. “But I am her opposite. I am pure. I am the Virgin of Virgins, the wielder of the Golden Power. My cum is blessed by the unicorns and I have pleased the Angelic Choir. I am the only one who has bathed with the maidenly oozes. I am the Futa-Heroine, and this power will not stop me from saving my twin sister!”

I concentrated on the tip of my cock, my ovaries quivering. I shuddered and burst with rapture. My pussy convulsed as cum fired out of my cock. My jizz splashed across the face of the barrier. The energy sizzled. It smoked as my silver cum bathed it.

I focused all my goodness. My love. My desire to protect. I countered the powers of hatred, betrayal, and jealousy. Murder, treachery, and destruction. I challenged them with love, fidelity, and compassion. 

“SAFFRON!” I howled and exploded with even more power.

My cum sprayed from my cock like a firehouse. The pleasure slammed through my body. Rapture pummeled my mind at the constant spray of jizz. My cum ate a hole in the evil. In the foul mix of powers. The madness behind this power had no match to my love.

The hole widened as my silver spunk gushed from my cock. Pussy cream soaked my blonde bush and spilled down my thighs. The hole widened further and further. It smoked at the edges, my cum evaporating as it drove back the evil.

“W-what are you doing, Lady Virginia?” Aria whispered. “I think this is—”

“I'm saving my twin sister!” I cried and leaped.

I jumped through the small hole, tucking my legs in high.

“No!” screamed Aria as I passed through the barrier. Without my stream of cum to slam into it, the energy sliced shut at me.

I cleared it, hitting the front door. My cock still erupted, slamming into the rusted metal The entrance to the Demon Lord's castle dissolved into flakes of black metal. My cum chewed through it, the purity too much for such an unclean place.

I looked behind me and saw Aria standing helpless on the other side. I was cut off from her. From everyone else. I was all alone in here. But I had the Golden Power on my side. My futa-harem had gotten me this far. They had allowed me the chance to challenge her.

“Saffron! I'm here!” I screamed and ran into the castle. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aria Dennell

Such fear shot through me. I felt the death radiating off the barrier. I backed away, tears spilling down my cheek. I clutched at my belly. Lady Virginia's cum should not have been strong enough to overcome this. It was the workings of the Three Goddesses of Chaos and the Demon Lord all at the same time. 

“It's a trap!” I screamed at Virginia as she charged through the dissolving doors and faded from view. “They let you in!”

My knees buckled. I sank to the ground. I had run here the moment I felt something was wrong. The moment that barrier had gone up. I didn't understand it. I didn't figure out what was going on until it was too late.

I hugged my belly, afraid my daughter would never get to meet both of her parents. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virginia Homewood

This was my dream come to life. I ran through the same black stone corridors so afraid for Saffron's life. It wasn't my fears manifested in my sleep, but a premonition of the future. I was meant to be here. This was my fate.

“Saffron!” I cried, running as fast as I could.

My bare feet slapped onto the stone. I wound through the passages. It was a maze, but I knew the path to take. I could hear my sister's cries. I could hear her urging me on. I had to save her from this cunt that had kidnapped her.

“Saffron, I'm coming!” I cried, my heart pounding in my chest.

I hurtled down the hallways, then I made that last turn. I burst into the throne. There was my saffron, chained to the foot of the skull throne. The Demon Lord sat on it in shadows. My heart pounded. This was it. What everything had been building up for. My destiny was at hand.

“Let her go!” I screamed.

Three shadowy figures laughed behind the throne. They were mocking me. Fury rose in me.

“Stay out of my way, little goddesses,” I snarled as I marched forward. This is between me and the Demon Lord.”

“Yes, it is, Virginia,” the Demon Lord said in such a familiar voice. Twisted. Broken, but...

Saffron rolled her eyes as the figure on the throne leaned forward. The light fell on her face. The features were older than my twin sister's chained to the throne. Bitter. Twisted. But there was no mistaking that the Demon Lord was Saffron. 

“What?” I gasped, my mind not comprehending what was going on here. Why did the Demon Lord look like an older version of my sister? My thoughts struggled to work.

“Yep,” my twin sister said. “Future me went evil because you sacrificed your life to save the world. Now she's going to kill me to make you just as insane and evil as her.”

It hit me then. I didn't understand how a future version of my sister was the Demon Lord. Some weird, MCU TV show shenanigans were going on here that was almost melting my brain. The only thing I had to focus on was this important fact.

I was wrong about the one in the shadows I had to save.

It was this evil version of my twin sister, the darkness cloaking her. I was never meant to kill the Demon Lord. It was all so clear now why I had to be the futa-heroine over every other person in existence. Who else could save her but me?

A knife flashed into Demon Lord Saffron's hand and plunged for my sister's throat.

“I NEED TO SAVE SAFFRON!” I screamed, pouring all my heart into my wish. 

Golden light burst out of my soul. It brimmed with all the love I felt for Saffron. At that moment, a lifetime of memories of my twin sister and burned through my mind. We had been together since birth. Every special moment in our lives—birthdays, vacations, the time Saffron's softball team won the tournament, my ballet recital when I was ten—all those wonderful times I had shared with her filled me. Getting accepted to the same private school. Living together. 

Falling in love together.

The first time we made love.

The passion we shared.

All of it was in this wish I made. It surged out with such power. Such force that the entire world shivered beneath the strength of my life. I, Virginia Homewood, loved my twin sister with every atom, every subatomic particle, that made up my being.

I found myself standing before the throne. I had crossed the intervening space before the dagger buried into my Saffron's throat. The blade hardly moved, inching along every few heartbeats. Demon Lord Saffron's hand was moving in super slow motion.

I grabbed it and time lurched to normal, the golden light fading.

Demon Lord Saffron gasped in shock. She stared at me, her eyes wide with madness. Such pain brimmed in the depths of my older twin sister's eyes. This version of her had gone through so much hardship. She had suffered so much, it broke her.

I had to save her. 

I needed to save her.

I kissed Future-Saffron, planting my mouth on hers. I pinned her against her own tacky throne, my cock thrusting out between her legs. I nudged into the shaved folds of her pussy lips, sliding over the base of her cock. 

She struggled. Fought. She tried to bend the dagger towards me. Shadows bled from her. The pain in her tormented soul spilled out of her as this blighted dark that tried to swallow me whole. But my love radiated out. My love for the Saffron kneeling at the base of the throne.

And for the Saffron I kissed. The broken one consumed by shadows.

I thrust my cock into her pussy.

She broke the kiss and gasped, “NOOOOO!”

Her silky cunt engulfed my cock. That wonderful pussy welcomed me back. This was my twin sister's cunt. This was the pussy that I loved. Such a thrill shot through me to be in her once more. Such a wonder to slide into this cunt.

“What are you doing?” demanded Demon Lord Saffron, her back arching. She pressed her small breasts into mine, her clit-dick throbbing between us. “You dumb cunts, stop her!”

“Mmm, this is intriguing,” purred a voice full of bloodlust and murder. Raatak. 

“We could help you,” cooed a voice dripping with malice and betrayal. Ammuch.

“But I am interested to see if this breaks you even further, dear Saffron,” sighed a voice burning with destruction. Itoyja.

There was something so familiar about those voices, but... I didn't care. My golden light flooded out of my soul. My cock thrust into Demon Lord Saffron's pussy. I fucked her hard. I buried into her again and again.

She squeezed her eyes shut, her head tossing from side to side as I thrust into her pussy. I buried hard, my left hand holding her right, keeping that dagger from my flesh. The shadows rippled off her, but they diffused away beneath my golden light.

“I fucking hate you, Virginia!” Saffron snarled, staring at me with those eyes. “You think fucking me once is going to save me? Huh? That you're going to liberate me with that pathetic, little cock.”

“I am going save you by loving you!” I gasped, burying into her juicy pussy. “But showering you in my Golden Power. That's what it is. It's my love for you. For the harem. But you most of all. You're the one I care for the most.”

“I don't love you!” spat the Demon Lord. Her eyes were mad as her pussy gripped me with hot and juicy passion. “You left me behind! I was supposed to be with you. I promised to return to you, but I can't! You're gone!”

“I'm right here!” I groaned, burying into her.

“You're not her!” She cupped my face with her free hand, her fingernails biting into my cheeks. “We didn't live the same lives. We fought against a different Demon Lord. You can't be here because you killed yourself saving me! Me!”

“That's how much she loved you, Saffron,” I groaned, burying into her pussy. “How much I love you. I would gladly lay down my life for you, but wouldn't it be better if I lived for you? Wouldn't that be something far, far more fantastic?”

“I would rather you wept with me. Cried. Sobbed. I would rather you experience the grief that you left me with. You died and tore out my heart. You didn't care that you were leaving me behind. I should have died with you!”

I froze in my strokes as I stared at her. Tears spilled down her cheeks. 

“I should have died with you, but you were a coward and took all the glory for yourself.” Such bitterness twisted her face. “You think this little fuck is enough to fill the whole your death left in me. I am a void. There is no filling it. I will destroy every fucking thing. I will leave nothing left in any universe but diffusing gasses! When you cum, I will slam this dagger into Saffron's throat. You'll be too weak to stop me.”

“I won't!” I said and thrust again. 

“You'll join me. We'll be the twin goddesses of destruction. We shall spill blood, fire, and betrayal across every universe.”

“Ooh, this is getting interesting,” moaned Ammuch.

“Fuck her hard, Virginia,” purred Raatak. I like this plan.

“We'll be a harem again,” groaned Itoyja. “As we burn existence to the ground.”

I knew those voices. I stared in shock at Demon Lord Saffron. “What did you do to our friends?”

“Broke them. I twisted them. I turned them into the Three Chaotic Goddesses. Then I used them to travel back in time and set myself up as the Demon Lord. All so I could welcome a new you into madness. You deserve to join us since this is all your fault!”

The angels understood it all. 

“I will save you, Saffron,” I promised. “I love you.”

“Even with all the pain and destruction I have caused. With all the madness. The brutality. My victims number in the tens of thousands. Why am I worth saving? Kill me!” 

“No!” I slammed into her cock hard and deep. I buried into her. “I will save you, Saffron. That's how I make this right.”

I kissed her, thrusting my tongue into her mouth. Her futa-cock throbbed between us. She gripped my hips with her thighs. She humped back against me. I loved the way her pussy slid up and down my cock. It felt amazing to have her gripping me like that.

I groaned, plunging deep into her twat. Hard. Her pussy massaged me with such force. I loved every second of it. She squeezed her twat around me. I loved every moment of burying into her. I savored that delight.

She was eager to make me cum. I would prove her wrong. This was the beginning. She wouldn't kill her past self. She wouldn't drive me insane. I slammed to the hilt in her twat with such force. I plunged over and over into her twat. 

The pressure swelled in my ovaries. That explosive release would burst out of me and shower her cunt with my cum. My nipples rubbed into her as our tongues danced. She shuddered beneath me, kissing me with such passion.

“God, that's hot watching you fuck Cunty Me,” my Saffron groaned. “I'm fucking my pussy with my cock. That's how hot this is. Don't let me be a whiny bitch any longer. Fucking save me. Save her!”

I broke the kiss and moaned, “I will!”

“Yes, yes, cum in my pussy!” she gasped. “Spurt that jizz into me and it changes nothing!”

“It'll change everything!” I howled, my cock burying deep and hard into her cunt. “Oh, yes, yes, Saffron, I love you!”

She laughed, her pussy clenching down on my futa-dick. The ache swelled at the tip. My ovaries brimmed with all that jizz that would burst through me. It would be such a wild delight. I pumped away at her twat. 

I hurtled closer and closer to cumming in her. I hurtled towards that moment of eruption. I would just baste her cunt with everything that I had. It was outstanding. I plunged to the hilt in her, my pussy quivering with all the pleasure. 

My ovaries ached.

The tip of my cock throbbed.

“Yes, yes, yes!” I gasped. “Cum on my dick, Saffron. I love you!”

Saffron's pussy convulsed around my cock. My older twin sister gasped as her futa-dick erupted between us. Her jizz splashed on my round tits. I savored the heat of her incestuous seed bathing my boobs as her cunt writhed around me.

Her pussy suckled at me. She nursed with such passion. It was so amazing. I threw back my head and erupted. I fired burst after burst of my cum into her snatch. The pleasure swept through me. My head tossed from the bliss. It was outstanding.

“Oh, Saffron! “I gasped as I spurted over and over again.

“Flood me with all that cum and save me,” groaned Saffron, her knife hand fighting against my grip. She wanted to kill my Saffron still.

“I will save you!” I cried, my blessed cum pumping into her snatch. “I need to save you!”

Golden light exploded around me. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Saffron Homewood

I gaped in astonishment. Virginia was gone. 

Cunty Me shuddered, her breasts dripping with her own cum, my sister's jizz, sparkling with her glitter, leaked out of Evil Me's pussy. She bolted to her feet, her round tits heaving and her cock swinging as he looked around.

Cum spilled out of her pussy and ran down her thighs.

“Well, it looks like you get to die after all, Saffron,” the Demon Lord said. “She abandoned you, too.”

“But first,” I said, “I've always wanted to eat my own cunt!”

I lunged for Cunty Me's pussy and buried my face into her sloppy depth. I licked. This would be the hottest masturbation ever. I knew my twin was doing something momentous. I just had to buy her time.

To be continued...
