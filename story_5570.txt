<P>The Honeymoon Dare<BR>
By ChristiandeNeuvillette@hotmail.com<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Mark, wake up.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
Groggily Mark woke up to feel his wife Mia gently shaking his shoulder.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;What? What is it?&#148; he asked, looking around to see it was still dark in their hotel suite.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;It&#146;s 3:00, time for our bet!&#148; she said.<BR>
<BR>
Mark remembered now.  They were playing tourist on their honeymoon, walking by the Provincial Legislature building, when Mark had casually suggested that they go back to their nearby hotel room for a quickie.  Mia had teased him about that.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;We&#146;re taking photos of the building, silly, can&#146;t you wait a few minutes?&#148;<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Let&#146;s do both, you could take photos while we have sex on the main steps of the legislature.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Please, you wouldn&#146;t have the guts to have sex in public.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Well maybe not at high noon.  Wake me up at three in the morning and we&#146;ll see who&#146;s chicken then&#148;.<BR>
<BR>
They shared a laugh over that, but now she actually was waking him up at three in the morning.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;You&#146;re serious?&#148;<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Sure, I was out on the balcony just now and the streets look deserted.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
Mia suggesting Mark usually got him instantly aroused, but the idea of doing it where they could get caught added a exciting rush that he didn&#146;t realize would be there.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Ok, let&#146;s do it.  Get dressed and leave your underwear behind.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
They quickly got dressed.  Mark had a loose pullover and button-fly jeans.  Mia was wearing a knee-length skirt and a tight sweater.  They both wore their running shoes &#147;just in case&#148;.<BR>
<BR>
The Legislature building was the sort of sprawling gothic marvel popular with government buildings 100 years earlier.  It sat at the back of large grounds with a variety of ornamental gardens.  It was very popular with newlyweds, so much so that Mark and Mia originally had to make an appointment to take wedding pictures on the grounds.<BR>
<BR>
The building faced a picturesque harbor.  Across the street to the left was a large museum and across the street to the right was the couple&#146;s hotel.  They choose it for its central location and that certainly was coming in handy now.<BR>
<BR>
Mark and Mia walked through the near-empty lobby of their hotel, nodding to a bored front desk attendant.  As they left the building they were immediately met with a strong wind blowing from out to sea.  A storm was coming in, but had not reached the city.  There was a chill to the wind, but not quite enough to make them return to their rooms to grab jackets.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Let&#146;s walk around and case the building&#148;, Mark said.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Hmm.  That&#146;s not going to look suspicious at all at 3:30 in the morning&#148;, replied Mia sarcastically.<BR>
<BR>
They walked north along the street and then turned along the street fronting the building.  The first problem was evident.  At night, the building&#146;s front was lit up with floodlights.  It was very pretty, but not in any way secluded.<BR>
<BR>
During the day, the grounds were busy with tourists.  The street in front had spots for horse and carriage tours.  You couldn&#146;t walk five feet without seeing a busker or a street vendor.<BR>
<BR>
Now of course, they were the only people on the streets.  The bars had all shut down over an hour earlier and the approaching storm had sent even the night owls indoors. No guards were in evidence, but that didn&#146;t mean there weren&#146;t any there.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Don&#146;t expect a lot of foreplay&#148;, said Mark, &#147;Well need to go pretty fast&#148;.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Don&#146;t worry about that - I&#146;m pretty turned on right now.  My heart is going like a hummingbird right now.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
&#147;How about right there&#148;, said Mark, pointing at a spot out of the direct light of the floodlights.<BR>
<BR>
They walked quickly across the front of the building to the main entrance.  The marble steps rose up to a set of double doors that led into the main foyer.   The doors were shut right now due to the late hour, but that wasn&#146;t their main objective.<BR>
<BR>
Instead there was a set of doors inset into their own alcoves on either side of the main hall.  The alcoves were perpendicular to the floodlights, so they were hidden in shadows.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Do you really want to go through with this?&#148; asked Mark.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Oh yes&#148;, said Mia, &#147;How about you?&#148;<BR>
<BR>
Mark didn&#146;t answer.  Instead he took one last look around the deserted grounds.  Nobody was in sight and most of the neighboring buildings were dark.  He took her hand and led her up the stairs the the front of the building.  The ducked around the alcove on the right.  They were in the shadows of the building, but would have still been visible to hundreds of tourists if it weren&#146;t so late.<BR>
<BR>
Pressed into the corner of the alcove, Mark held Mia by the shoulders as he gazed into her eyes.  As she looked back up at him with a knowing smile, he silently thanked heaven for his good fortune.  They wrapped their arms around each other to hug and there lips touched to kiss.<BR>
<BR>
The kiss started with a few pecks, then they simultaneously opened their mouths wider to make the kiss deeper.  Tongues darted into each others mouths as their hands began roaming each other&#146;s bodies.  In no time Mark had his hands up Mia&#146;s sweater and was fondling her firm breasts, paying particular attention to her nipples.  The approaching storm&#146;s chill wind found its way up the sweater along with Mark&#146;s hand, causing them to stiffen to hard little points from the combination of breeze and arousal.<BR>
<BR>
Mia&#146;s hands were not idle.  One hand had snaked up the back of Mark&#146;s shirt and she was raking his back with not quite enough force to leave scratches.  Her other hand was on the front of his pants, roughly squeezing his now iron hard cock through the denim.<BR>
<BR>
Mark was trying to concentrate on the wonderful feelings, but he was still hyperaware of the fact that they were outside on the front of the Provincial capital building, making out.  He broke the kiss to take a quick look around.  He could see through the door&#146;s window to see part of the main foyer, it was still and dark, lit only by emergency exit signs.  He turned his head to see that there was no one behind them and Mia seized the opportunity to stick tongue in his ear and nibble at the lobe.<BR>
<BR>
Returning his full attention to the wonderful task at hand, he turned back to his bride and returned to a full deep kiss.  He pressed her against the side door and he could feel her heart pounding against his.  One hand dragged down her front side all the way down one shapely thigh to the knee outside her skirt to the back of her knee.  He came back up the thigh on the inside of the skirt to her crotch.  He cupped her bare pussy, feeling the heat from it.  His fingers ran along her folds to feel the slight dampness from within.<BR>
<BR>
He searched with his middle finger for her opening and pressed inside her, feeling a slight resistance at first followed by the furnace heat of her within.  She moaned deeply into his mouth as he thrust his finger inside.  Both of her arms hugged him tightly.<BR>
<BR>
He pulled the finger, slick with her juices and used it to moisten the rest of the labia.  He repeated this several times, pushing inside to retrieve more, then pulling out to make everything slick with her moisture.  Quickly he was finger fucking her against the wall, his thumb rubbing the hard little bead of her clit.  She was clinging tightly to him, her breath gasping in his ear.<BR>
<BR>
He was positioning his index finger to join his middle finger when she rasped &#147;Fuck me&#148; in his ear.<BR>
<BR>
They broke contact so that he could fumble his hard cock out of his fly.  She stood leaning against the alcove door with her legs spread, hiking the front of her skirt up so that it wouldn&#146;t get in the way.<BR>
<BR>
He was shocked as the cold breeze hit the skin of his erect cock.  For a split second he remembered where they were and what they were attempting.  Then the look of his new wife, disheveled and hungry for him snapped him back.  He bent his knees deep to position himself between her thighs.  She grabbed his prick and guided him roughly to her vagina.<BR>
<BR>
With one hard thrust he was all the way in her and they both gasped involuntarily from the rough pleasure of it.  He reached around to her ass and lifter against the wall.  She wrapped all four limbs around him and they were fucking.<BR>
<BR>
He drove repeatedly into her against the door.  Each thrust met with an equal squeeze of her thighs and a short moan from the back of her throat.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Harder&#148;, she moaned into his ear and he increased the force and tempo of his thrusts.  He wasn&#146;t trying to hold back as he normally did, he was fucking as fast as he could, rabbit fast.  &#147;Oh.  God. she rasped through clenched teeth as he felt her pussy quivering in orgasm over him.  His own orgasm was nearly upon him, coming like a freight train from somewhere deep within him.<BR>
<BR>
Just as he crossed the point of no return a light came on in the foyer beyond the door.  Adrenaline poured into his system as he exploded in orgasm.  A security guard looked up at the door in shock at the couple.  He was walking fast, about to break into a run towards the door as he spoke into the handset of his radio.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Oh shit&#148; said Mark, his voice now more panic then lust.<BR>
<BR>
Mia turned to look while unhooking her legs.  Seeing the guard her eyes went wide and she quickly disengaged from Mark.  They ran down the stairs of the legislature while clumsily trying to simultaneously straighten their clothing.<BR>
<BR>
They sprinted back to their hotel room, convinced that an army of security guards was hot on their tail.  Fumbling quickly with the room key despite there being no one on their floor at this hour, they finally fell back onto the bed.<BR>
<BR>
They lay there for a moment, gasping with the exertion of their frenzied fucking and impromptu sprint, then they started laughing.  Outside, the storm front finally reached the city.  They lay in each others arms listening to the rain and wind outside their room, finally falling asleep.<BR>
<BR>
The next morning they woke to find the sun shining and the storm long passed.  It was almost noon.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Well the cops didn&#146;t knock on the door, so I think we got away with it&#148;, said Mark.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Yeah, but what are we going to do to top that?&#148; asked Mia.<BR>
<BR>
The end.<BR>
