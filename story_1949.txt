Evelyn is invited to join a very exclusive club, but she must first be interviewed by the admissions committee and explain why she deserves to be a part of SaM's very exclusive club. The series begins with her first night at the club and then progresses through the stories she tells the committee to prove she is worthy to become a permanent part of SaM's Club.

The stories are better understood if you have read the previous chapters, but each chapter stands more or less on its own.

In Chapter eleven, Evelyn tells the seventh of ten tales to show her superiority as a true Mistress.

Now it was a jurywoman who stood. "For your seventh story, Evelyn, tell us of an experience where you put someone in their place who shouldn't have been made equal to you to begin with.

Evelyn smiled, "That would be back in college. Oh, I do miss those days in the sorority."

Someone had passed some sort of law that said that the university had to admit a particular number of this or that type of person. That didn't bother me, but then the university said that all the sororities and fraternities had to include the same percentages in our pledge classes. I think the intent was that we would have to let those kind of people into the house, but the way the ruling was written, it only said we had to invite them into the pledge class. As all of you know, I assume, not everyone who pledges for an important sorority or fraternity is accepted into the house.

We delta girls had nothing against the color of a person's skin or what country they were from, but we didn't want trash of any color in the house. We had somewhat of an advantage over other houses when it came to rejecting the percentage people. Our pledge queen - the sister in charge of the pledges - was black. She was also very athletic and muscular, sort of like that black slave I saw in the club earlier tonight.

Delia was from Jamaica and would get really angry if you called her an African-American. "I'm not some slave freed by a honky war," she would say. "We won our own freedom and founded our own nation. I am Jamaican."

Her grandfather made a fortune in something or another down in the islands and she was just the type of woman we wanted as a sister - actually, she was very much like me. She was really upset that we had to take what she called Street N****s into the pledge class. There was no way that Stella or Gwen was going to become a delta girl.

There were 14 girls in the pledge class, but only 8 spots open as full sisters, so 6 of the pledges were going to be rejected. Three quit fairly soon once they realized what was really expected of them in order to be a delta girl, but Stella and Gwen hung in to the last. The selection had already been made when Delia came up with an idea to show Stella and Gwen what they really were.

Normally when the pledge class is finished, each of the girls is taken by a delta girl out into the woods near the campus. There they would be told that they had been accepted or given the bad news of rejection - well, they weren't exactly told. They had to allow themselves to be blindfolded, tied to a tree and stripped naked. Then they were shaved. Part of the pledging hazing was that they had to let all of their body hair grow during their pledge time. If accepted, their pubic hair would be shaved into an open triangle - a triangle is the shape of the Greek letter delta in case you didn't know. If rejected, their pubic hair would be completely shaved off. It would only be after they had been released and removed their blindfolds that they would know if they were a delta girl or nothing.

Anyway, Delia and I took Stella and Gwen into the woods, only we traveled a little farther than normal. We went all the way out to an old scout camp that had gone bankrupt. That is when we gave them the bad news. "Girls," Delia began, "I have some good news and some bad news for you. There is only one slot left. That means that one of you will become a delta girl. One of you will be rejected. We are going to perform a couple of tests and the winner of those tests is the first black trash delta girl ever."

Both Stella and Gwen looked at Delia with confused expressions on their faces. "Just kidding girl," Delia said in her best imitation of ghetto slang. Then she yelled out, "Hey ladies," and most of the rest of the house appeared out of the trees and bushes.

"What we are going to do is a simple test of speed and endurance. But it is going to be speed under special circumstances and endurance as a delta pledge. Are both of you girls willing?"

Stella and Gwen both nodded a yes.

"Then the first thing you have to do," continued Delia, "is to get naked."

Stella's eyes widened, but Gwen just started taking off her clothing. Gwen already knew that the final test would involve them being naked in the woods, so she didn't think anything was wrong. Stella had a little more street smarts, however, and smelled a rat.

"You could be making our choice very easy, Stella," said Delia and Stella began taking off her clothing.

Delia handed the clothing to one of the delta girls and said, "Take care of this." Then Delia led Stella and Gwen over to the abandoned parking lot in front of the ruins of what was once a main building. "We are going to have a little relay race," she said. But since there is only one person on each team we had to come up with a special sort of relay. Each of you is going to carry water from here to over there and fill up that five gallon bucket. When it is full, you are going to carry the bucket back here to the starting line.

"What are we going to carry the water in," asked Stella.

"Ah, that is the special part," answered Delia. "YOU are going to carry the water." With that Delia held up an enema bag and hose.

"No way," snapped Gwen.

Delia held up a battery powered beard trimmer and switched it on. "Then just stand still for a moment while I register your status for the rest of the girls."

Gwen hung her head and walked over to where Delia had indicated. "On your hands and knees," barked Delia and Stella and Gwen slowly sank to the ground. "Some of the girls wanted to put soap in the water, but I had pity on you girls. This is just warm water... not too cold and not too hot, so it won't cause extensive cramping just from the temperature. Lets see how fast you can carry water over to those buckets."

Two of the delta girls held the enema bags while another girl inserted the nozzles. Then the warm water was released. Delia gave the girls some advice. "Don't try to hold more than you can, girls. If you start to cramp, just start to run. The nozzle will pop out and we will have a full bag waiting for you when you get back."

Gwen was biting her lip. Stella was crying, but both remained in position on their hands and knees. Gwen's bag was only about half empty when suddenly she bolted upright and started running. She almost made it to the bucket before water and shit began to spew from her. She squatted over the bucket and finished emptying herself. Stella did not begin running until the girl holding her bag yelled, "Empty." Stella made it all the way to the bucket before releasing her smelly load. Amazingly, after Gwen's first disastrous lap, she was able to hold the full bag and kept yelling "faster, faster," to the girls who were filling her insides. I guess she really wanted to be a delta girl.

It took twelve or thirteen trips to fill the buckets, but finally the judges standing next to both of the buckets yelled "One more lap." Gwen and Stella ran as hard as they could. It was comical to see them run with their bloated bellies swaying before them and their ass cheeks clenched tightly together to prevent premature loss of the water. Both girls had stopped squatting over the buckets after the second or third lap and now just plopped down on the narrow rims of the buckets to relieve themselves. There was a loud splash of water and both picked up their buckets and ran for the finish line. They arrived at the same time.

"We seem to have a tie," yelled Delia. "I guess the final decision will be based on endurance."

Both girls were taken over to the edge of the clearing where two cut off telephone poles stuck up out of the ground. On the way over the Stella had to stop twice and squat to relieve herself on the ground. Gwen stopped only once before reaching the poles. At the base of each pole a long chain was attached to an eyebolt. On the end of the chain was a set of manacles. When Stella and Gwen reached the poles one end of the chain manacle was clamped onto their wrist. Then the short chain that held the manacle cuffs was looped around the pole and over a long nail-like step on the opposite side of the pole. The other wrist was then clamped in the manacle. The result was that both girls were held tight against the poles with their hands high above their heads around the poles.

"Listen up," yelped Delia. "This is the way it is going to work. Each of you will receive ten swats from me with this pledge paddle. If you can keep from screaming, you are a delta girl. If you yell, you are out. Blindfold them!"

Stella and Gwen had felt the pledge paddle before and although it hurt like hell, both knew that they could survive ten swats without making more than a grunt. But what they didn't know is that the paddle in Delia's hand wasn't an ordinary pledge paddle. From the front it looked like any other pledge paddle, but I had taken it to a custom furniture shop and had the back side grooved so that it was a series of rounded, parallel ridges. That uneven surface doubled or tripled the pressure and the pain. Stella and Gwen didn't have a chance.

Delia stood behind Gwen and swung as hard as she could. Gwen yelped, but did not scream. "That's one," Delia announced and then moved over to where Stella was chained. It took seven swats to break Stella and nine to break Gwen. In the end they both screamed and yelled, "No more, no more, please no more."

I stood next to Delia with the electric razor as she announced, "They are nothing." Then I switched it on and shaved them bald, and not only between the legs, but also their heads. They were blubbering and sobbing so much from the pain and the thought of failure that I don't think they even noticed.

Then it was time for me to deliver the final blow. "Stella and Gwen you are nothing. You will find the key to each other's manacles near the top of the pole to which you are chained. If one of you can climb far enough up your pole to retrieve the key and pull your manacle chain over the top, you can take the key to the other person. Your long chain should give you enough slack to reach the other pole. But remember, the only way to get free is to free each other."

"When you get back to the sorority house, you will find all of your clothing and personal possessions in the tool shed out back. You can use the hose there to clean yourselves up. Since we are taking all the clothes you were wearing with us, you might want to wait until it is dark to sneak back onto campus. But to be sure that you black-trash pieces of trash don't sneak up on anybody important without warning, we are going to help people know that you are approaching."

With that I gave a hand signal and four newly accepted pledges approached each pole carrying the five gallon pails. Two went to each pole with the bucket they carried and dumped the fetid water over the crying girls heads. We stood there watching them cry and sob for a few minutes and then walked back to campus to join the pledge acceptance party which was probably in full swing at the sorority house.

I guess Stella and Gwen managed to get free and get back to campus, because they weren't there when we went out to check the next morning, but they left school and I never saw them again. I read somewhere a few years later that they had started a business together selling cosmetics especially tailored for African-Americans, but I don't know how that worked out or what ever became of them after that.
