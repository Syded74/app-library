Full Service Girl

   Saturday January 19, 2007

   Thomas Haden picked up the last invoice in his inbox, sighed, and looked
at the order number in the right upper corner of the sheet.  He punched the
ten digit number into his computer.  The computer form of the invoice came
up on the computer.  He looked it over and made three corrections.  He then
saved the invoice to a file in his My Documents area.  He then pulled up
his email box, prepared an email, and copied twenty invoices to the email.
He then sent the email, saving a copy in his hard drive.  He prepared
another email, then reminded his boss and staff that he would be on
vacation for the next two weeks.  He sent the email, then shut down.

   He looked up from his computer.  It was midday on Saturday, and he was
the only one in the office.  He stood up, went to the bathroom, emptied his
bladder, then exited the building, locking up after himself.  He then
dialed the alarm service to let them know that he was leaving and to put
the building on full alarm.  Getting in his car, he was pleased to hear one
of his favorite ELO songs on the radio, He cranked the radio and started
the drive home.

   When he got home he did a load in the washing machine and dryer, then
packed a suitcase.  He cranked up his home computer and checked his
personal email then cruised his favorite bulletin boards.  There was only
one half interesting entry, to which he didn't reply.  He clicked off of
the internet, cleaned his memory, then he pulled up his favorite Sandra
model images.  He cruised the images, feeling more like Sandra, than Chelda
or Skye today.  One image jumped out at him.

   "Oh yeah" he thought stroking his meat, "why can't there be strip joints
for girls like Sandra?" He imagined her bumping and grinding onstage, then
approaching him with her tiny chest as he tipped her.  "Come back for a
personal dance?" he asks.  Sandra nods her head.  Minutes later, she's
grinding her naked body against his before she sinks to her knees and takes
his dick out.  She grinds against him, getting the tip of his dick in her
tiny pussy.  Sandra grips the back of his neck with her right hand and
grinds her hips into his.  He's able to get half his member in her.  Both
Sandra and Thomas are getting sweaty and breathing hard.  Suddenly he
shoots his cum into her.  Sandra hugs him as his pulses slow and he hears
her raspy breathing next to his ear.  He tips her a hundred dollar bill. 
She smiles and dismounts, being kind enough to zip him back up again.  Then
she walks off to the dressing room, her little ass wiggling as fluids
between her thighs shine in the half light of the club.

   Thomas shot his wad into a napkin, spilling some on his abdomen.  He
cleaned up, then shut down his computer.  He went into the kitchen and
cooked himself an Italian dinner before returning in front of his TV to
watch one of his favorite movies.  As "Force Ten from Navarone" started he
dug into the lasagna casserole he made. 
____________________________________________________________________________

   Sunday January 20, 2007

   A nasty blue norther was blowing in as Thomas packed his car.  He was
pleased to hear one of his favorite church services on an am radio station.
He cranked it up as the choir was in rare form today, spilling out some get
down gospel, causing their congregation to clap in unison to the beat.  The
preacher was even extraordinarily upbeat form, keeping his sermon short and
funny.  The choir got extra time after his sermon, burning it down with
more gospel.

   The service must have affected the person working at the station, who
filled the next half hour with some powerful christian music, including
Shout to the Lord and I'm a Friend of Jesus.  Thomas sang along to the
music and felt cathartically better.  He was deeply in need of this kind of
relief.  Work had been a total bitch lately with an unbelievable workload.
He would've gone to church today, but he needed to put miles between his
home/work and a rest place somewhere out in the country.  He had a map and
was headed in a general direction, but he didn't, as of yet, have a
destination in mind.  Four hours later, he found the destination.

   Forty years ago, Linwood had been a very busy place.  Then a major
railroad terminal and transportation crossroads, a number of local
industries supported the passenger and freight service.  After Congress
killed the passenger rail, the bottling plant, ice plant, and a number of
restaurants and hotels closed.  Business shrank to one tenth of what it had
been in the town.  Population of the town dwindled by sixty percent in less
than a decade, the hangers on being retirees, those too stupid to get out,
and those with a financial status that allowed them to stay in the aged,
but scenic area.

   The deserted main street, populated by aged brick buildings caught
Thomas' fancy.  Many of the buildings were shuttered, but there was
something about the 1930's construction that exercised his imagination.  He
easily imagined a bustling street with large bulky 1940's Fords, Buicks,
Desotos, and Lincolns parked along the curb while people in the dress of
the time went about their daily business.

   He pulled off the main drag and found an open restaurant.  It was a no
frills building with a dirt parking lot, a green cinder block wall and
brick facade front.  He went inside and saw the eight items on the menu
written on cardboard behind the counter.  Thomas ordered the Hamburger
Deluxe, which meant a basket of chips came with the burger.  He wolfed down
the burger and chips, chasing it with a pepsi before asking the cook/waiter
for a hotel.  He was told to pick between one two blocks away, and one next
to the highway.

   Thomas drove two blocks over and found a large old two story stucco
exterior building.  The only clue that this was a hotel was a faded green
block of paint on the front that read "Hotel".  Thomas parked his car and
made his way to the spacious front porch.  He took it in for a few seconds
before pulling open the heavy wooden door.

   He opened the door to a hotel lobby forgotten by time.  A large
staircase was to his right.  A row of chairs, at least fifty years old,
lined the back wall.  A giant sized map of the United States was placed
above the chairs.  Two wooden doors, he supposed were rooms, were to his
left.  Under the staircase was a door marked "Manager".  He went up to the
door and rang a buzzer.  From inside the room he could hear rustling
sounds. A moment later, a white haired man in his seventies appeared.

   "Do you have a room?" Thomas asked.  The old man seemed stunned,
recovering seconds later, "Yes, yes, I have rooms" he answered.  "How
much?" "Thirty eight for the night, or two hundred for the week." "Do you
take plastic?" Thomas asked.

   The old man frowned.  Thomas was prepared for that.  He pulled out his
checkbook.

   "Who do I make it out to?" "City Hotel" the old man replied.

   Thomas wrote the check and was directed to a room upstairs.  Thomas went
upstairs to the room and was greeted to the cold that not only was outside
and the lobby, but upstairs as well.  The old man told him he would turn on
heat to the room and a moment later he could hear the rush of steam and
banging noises that told him the early twentieth century heating system was
working.

   Thomas unpacked, placing his clothes in a very worn dresser.  As he did
this he felt his cellphone vibrate in his pocket.  He didn't recognize the
number and he decided he didn't want any interruptions.  He turned the
cellphone off and placed it in the dresser.Finally, he took out a book from
his favorite author and sat down to read. 
____________________________________________________________________________

   Monday, January 21, 2007

   Taking a shower in the morning was more of a daunting task than Thomas
ever anticipated.  His room had a private bathroom, one with an original
claw foot cast iron tub.  The shower mechanism was simply a stainless steel
pipe that arose from the water faucet and curved-there was no showerhead.
Thomas had to play with the faucet to get that happy medium somewhere
between scalding hot and bone chilling cold.  Unlike modern hotels, this
one didn't have complimentary shampoo and soap.  Thomas was glad he had
paid attention to his gut instinct and brought his own.

   After the shower, he dressed and went to the same restaurant he had
eaten in the night before.  They had a generous breakfast for a very
moderate price.  After breakfast, he returned to his hotel room, but
reading the book in the quiet room had a deafening silence.  He took the
book and went downstairs to the lobby to read.

   About a half hour into reading the book, the old man came out.  A
conversation and the old man told the story of the building they were in,
how he had inherited it from his father, and kept it up as it just barely
paid for itself and was better than a boring retirement ( he was retired
from the railroad).  After a little prodding he found that the old man
wasn't just single, but happily so, almost seeming unable to date women
because of a social inadequacy.  It was as this conversation was ending
that she walked in.

   She looked to be between thirteen and fourteen.  She had a cherubic face
with porcelain colored skin, almond shaped eyes, a button nose, and plump
full lips.  Her face was framed by thick black hair cut into a mop top
haircut.  She was inappropiately dressed for the weather, her jacket on,
but open, her tube top tightly wrapped around half orange sized and shaped
breasts, and a pair of daisy dukes that hugged her hips and topped her long
bare legs.  She was carrying a small black tote bag.

   "Hi" she said as she approached him.

   Thomas noticed the old man got up and went into his office, closing and
locking the door.

   "Hello" Thomas replied as the girl sat and he wondered what he was
getting into.  "I'm Thomas" he added, wondering where the conversation
would go.

   "I'm Linda" the girl said, extending a hand.

   Thomas noticed how cold her hand was.  "Are you cold?" he asked.

   "It doesn't bother me" she answered as she noticed his book.  "I like
the guy you're reading" she said, adding, "I really like his book about the
missing train.  I think it captures late 1970's Canadian politics very
well. That's why my teacher recommended it.  I got an A on that paper."

   "Have you read his other books?"

   "Not completely.  I am fascinated by his obsession with pre Columbian
contact.  I think he's on to something.  I referenced his theory on that in
a science paper and got marked down for that.  It's the only B I got that
year."

   "The only B?"

   "I study hard.  I want to get a scholarship to a major university."

   "What do you want to study?"

   "Law, I want to be a lawyer.  I will be, someday." she paused a second,
"Are you in town for the day, or are you staying longer?"

   "I haven't decided", Thomas answered, wondering if he was being trapped.
After a pregnant pause, he asked:"Aren't you supposed to be in school?"

   "It's M.L.K.  day."

   "Oh"

   "What room are you in?" she asked.

   "202" he warily answered, "Why?"

   "I'm the hotel maid, but I'm also a full service girl" she answered as
she ran her finger along the top of her tube top, revealing the first half
inch of flesh.

   "What kind of service do you offer?"

   "Modeling, massage, there are other things on the menu."

   Thomas's head was reeling.  It took a moment for him to recover.  "I
want to believe you, but...tell you what, hand me your bag."

   "What for?"

   "You need me to trust you.  I want to trust you.  I need to know you're
not wearing a wire."

   She handed him the bag with a look of disgust.  Thomas fished through
the bag, finding nothing electronic except her cellphone-which was off.  He
put the bag down on a chair, then told her to stand up.  He stood and
carefully checked her jacket.  Satisfied that she wasn't recording their
conversation, and with condoms, a negligee, and baby oil in her bag that
proved her case, he handed her the bag and directed her to come upstairs to
his room.

   Once in the privacy of his room he asked her again what services she
offered.  Most of the services she offered came in around two hundred
dollars, but one caught his attention.

   "What's a full service massage?" he asked.

   "You're naked, I'm naked.  I really think you'll like it."

   "Let's go with that."

   "O.k., undress and lie face down."

   After he had paid her Linda watched him and slipped her shorts down
revealing she had no underwear and a hairless pussy.  Her tube top came off
next landing next to her shorts and sneakers.Meanwhile, Thomas also
disrobed.  When he was nude, Linda had him lay face down.  Linda then
straddled him and began an expert massage, starting at his scalp and
working slowly and carefully down to his feet.  Thomas actually had to
fight off drowsiness from the relaxing effects of the massage.  Linda then
whispered to him to turn over.

   When Thomas turned over, she straddled his abdomen.  She started at the
top of his scalp, but as she massaged his face, she scooted her hips down
and her groin came into contact with his.  She could feel his dick grow
from semi erectness to full hardness.  She scooted back up and lowered her
breasts into his face.  She lowered first one, then other nipple to his
lips.  Thomas licked and suckled on the large pink puffy nipples.

   Linda then raised up, positioning herself directly over his groin.  She
used the moisture from her gash as lubrication.  She began sliding back and
forth on his dick.  He reached up, placing his hands on her very firm
breasts.  She leaned against his hands and increased her grinding-she was
enjoying this as much as he was.  He began thrusting his hips up.

   "I need to put my dick in you" he gasped.

   "You have to put a condom on, o.k.?"

   He nodded.  She dismounted from him and retrieved a condom from her bag.
She took the condom out and unrolled it on him.  She then mounted him
again, and lowered herself onto him.  It was a tight fit and he could only
get about three quarters of his dick into her.  She then began slowly
humping him.  She established a rhythym, then the humping grew faster.

   Thomas was unsatisfied, so he rotated her, placing her under him while
he stayed in her.  She smiled, nervously accepting what he was doing.  It
took him a few minutes to get the position and rhythym he wanted, then he
began pumping her vigorously.  The iron bed was slapping against the wall,
probably letting the manager know what was going on upstairs, but Thomas
was past caring.  He felt his cum rising and he shot his load into the
condom.

   He collapsed on top of her, taking several minutes to catch his breath.
When his breath resumed at a normal pace, he rolled off of her.

   "Thank you, that was great" he told her.

   "You're welcome" she said as she got up and started fishing for her
clothes.

   "Where are you going?" he asked.

   "Aren't you done?" she asked.

   "Actually, no, um, can you stay?"

   "You want me to stay?"

   "Yeah."

   "How long?"

   "The rest of the day, and, um, can you swing the night too?"

   "You want me to stay the night?"

   "You're good company, and you're good in bed.  Besides, I'm the kind of
guy who feels that anything under two hours is a rip off.I'd like to make
love to you, not just hit it, then we're done."

   She sat on the edge of the bed.  "No one's ever asked me to stay the
night."

   "How long have you been doing this?"

   She opened her mouth to answer, then decided to change the topic, "So,
how much.." she paused, thinking out loud.

   "Look, I paid you two hundred, how about five hundred for the night?"

   "For what?" she asked with a wariness in her eyes.

   "Conversation, and regular sex."

   "In advance, o.k.?"

   "I'd have to go to an ATM, do you know where the nearest one is?"

   She thought for a moment.  "Tell you what, I'll trust you for a bit.  We
can do it, then after, we'll go to the ATM.  By the way, you have to buy me
dinner too, a nice dinner, o.k.?"

   "Done."

   Linda slid up next to Thomas.  "So, how do you want to do this?"

   He answered her by kissing her, drinking in the luciousness of her lips.
After seeing Pretty Woman, Linda thought it wise to follow the rule about
no kissing on the lips, but her customer had caught her by surprise.  She
returned the kisses, feeling his hands gently gripping her head.  This was
new to her.  She had made out with a boy once, but he only touched her
around the ribs, this was better.  Soon, he moved to kissing her around the
neck, then he slowly moved down her body, pausing for a while at her
breasts, where he suckled on one nipple while he massaged the other before
he alternated.

   This was better than anything Linda had ever experienced.  She had
started offering full service six months earlier, several months after she
starting working at the hotel.  A guest, a man in his sixties, had offered
her fifty bucks to clean his room in the nude.  He seemed harmless enough,
so she did.  The next day, he offered the fifty again, but then wanted
more. Because her vagina was so small, he couldn't get his aged semi hard
dick in, but she had got him off with a handjob.

   He made a couple of more return trips to the hotel because of her. 
Because of the experiences from him, she started dressing very skimpily. 
Since the old man, she had given three blowjobs, one full service massage,
and one quickie.  The quickie was where she actually lost her virginity. 
He was only in his mid twenties and she had yelped and cried, experiencing
pain and bleeding.  Still, she was making an average of one hundred and
fifty per experience and her bank account was beginning to look nice. 
College was going to be expensive, her dad would be little to no help, and
the carefully looked after bank account was going to be her escape kit from
this town, which she had come to loathe.  This man had offered five hundred
for the night, which brought her closer to her goal, and best yet, she was
enjoying herself.

   As Thomas placed his mouth on her groin, Linda was on the verge of
orgasm.  Her breathing had sped up and she was feeling contractions in her
abdomen.  As his tongue circled her clit, she felt herself on the verge of
exploding.  Sensing her proximity to orgasm, he sucked on her clit.

   Linda felt herself explode.  A light went off in her head, she screamed,
and suddenly she had to get him off her clit as waves of pleasure were
slamming into her body.  She pushed his head off her clit, and she curled
into the fetal position as her first orgasm caused her to spasm.  As the
waves subsided she laid back on her back.

   "What did you do to me?" she asked.

   "Haven't you had an orgasm before?"

   She shook her head with a smile.  He placed his head back between her
legs.  She suddenly felt very tender between her legs.  "Wait" she
whispered, "it's very tender there, go easy."

   He took her warning and took his time licking her.  He looked up to see
her cupping her breasts.  Here eyes were closed and her breathing was deep
and fast.  He stuck a finger in her, which caused her to yelp.  He started
finger fucking her while working her clit.  Linda felt herself ready to
explode.  She raised her hips and started thrusting against his finger. 
Suddenly, her second orgasm hit.  She screamed and pushed his hand and face
away.

   While she recovered from her orgasm, he took a condom out from her bag.
He wrapped his rascal, then climbed back on the bed where Linda saw what he
was about to do, and adjusted her legs to accomdate him.  He lined himself
up and entered her.  Linda gasped several times while he entered her, then
began moaning while he began pumping.  After a minute, she found his
rhythym and began thrusting her hips to meet him.

   Thomas leaned in and started kissing her while he pumped her.  Linda dug
her hands into his shoulders as she experienced the most erotic moment of
her life.  Linda felt another orgasm building and as she began to explode
she heard him grunt and felt his dick spasm in her.  He collapsed on top of
her.

   It took five minutes for the couple to recover from their love making.
He rolled off of her and laid alongside her body.  She draped one of her
legs over his in a playful manner.

   "That was incredible" he said.

   "That was amazing!!" Linda added, "I've never done that before."

   "Never?" he asked.

   "Never", she confirmed, "usually guys just get off, and they're done.  I
mean you made my head go all a-a-a-a-a" she said gesturing with her hands
and head to indicate a wild experience.

   "You liked that?"

   "Hell yeah."

   "I'll need a little time to recover."

   Linda rolled over and draped her body over his.  She laid her head on
his chest.  Thomas ran his hands over the smooth skin of her back.  Linda
moaned softly.  The couple relaxed and fell asleep. 
____________________________________________________________________________

   The ringing of Linda's cellphone awoke the couple from their nap.  Linda
lazily raised her head, then realized where she was and what was going on.
"Oh shit" she said as she shot straight up.  She scrambled to her bag and
took the cellphone out.  "Hi dad" she purred, answering the phone.  Thomas
looked over at Linda.  She gestured with her eyes before saying, "Sorry
dad, I was at Cheryl's.  We were having fun and I lost track of time."

   Linda listened for a moment, then asked, "Dad, Cheryl wants to know if
it's o.k.  if I spend the night, can I?" She listened a moment, then added,
"tomorrow is a parent conference day, the calendar is on the fridge", then
she improvised:"It's alright with her parents, want to talk to her dad?" A
moment later Linda handed the phone to Thomas.

   "Hello?" Thomas asked.

   Thomas heard a male voice asking if it was alright if Linda spent the
night and if it was any trouble.

   "No, she's no trouble at all.  We love having her over."

   The voice told him to bring her over in the morning.

   "Sure", Thomas agreed before handing the phone back to Linda.

   "Talk to you later Dad" Linda said before ending the call.

   "What did I just do?" Thomas asked.

   "Cheryl is a friend from school" Linda explained, "like me, she wants to
get out of this burg.  My dad is a nice guy, he loves me, but he's one of
those artist types.  We live month to month, that's why I'm a full service
girl.  I have a plan.  I want out."

   Thomas stood up and hugged Linda.  The gesture caught her by surprise.
After a couple of seconds she hugged him back.

   "Hungry?" he asked.

   "A little."

   "What do you want to eat?"

   "Ummm" she answered, "this is a small town, people talk.  There's
another town ten miles over, they have several restaurants.  Is that o.k.?"

   "Sure."

   Linda walked over to her clothes.  "We'll need to stop at my place for a
change of clothes."

   "Sure, fine."

   Tuesday January 22, 2007

   "Hey" Thomas said.

   "Hey back."

   Thomas reached over and gently ran his hand through the hair of the
naked fourteen year old girl waking up next to him.  Linda moved her head
so that her cheek was brushed by his hand.

   "What do you want to do today?" he asked.

   "Well, first, you have to take me home, but you want to do something
interesting today?"

   "Yeah, what do you have in mind?"

   "I know a place.  You'll need to pack a picnic lunch for us."

   "I think I can handle that."

   Thomas slid his hand to her hips and pulled her to him.  Linda put a
hand on his chest and pushed.

   "No, I'm sore, besides, I, we, need a shower" she giggled.

   "Alright" he said as they rose from the bed and went into the bathroom.
____________________________________________________________________________

   Thomas dropped off Linda at home at nine, but picked her up again at
ten. Linda directed him out of town and towards a mountain range.  A little
under an hour later, he parked near a campground.  The couple got out, then
began an ascent up a trail.

   For ninety minutes they climbed up the mountain, sometimes pausing to
take in the view.  Finally, they reached a lower summit of the mountain. 
The valley floor spread out beneath them for hundreds of miles.  The view
was nothing less than breathtaking.  Linda told Thomas to sit, then, in a
hushed voice said:"listen."

   Thomas was quiet for a moment hearing only the sound of the wind
whistling through the pines before he whispered:"what for?"

   "What do you hear?" she asked.

   "Nothing."

   "Isn't that a wonderful sound?" Then after pausing a moment added:
"Cheryl brought me here with her family once.  I didn't want to leave.  I
enjoy the view, the sound, the peace, isn't it perfect?"

   "Yeah."

   Linda hugged him, then held him for a moment.  Finally, the couple took
out the picnic lunch and dined heartily.  After lunch, they sat and just
took in the view for a while more.  Finally, they began the descent to the
campground.

   It was mid afternoon when they got back to town.  Linda was still a
little sore, so instead of heading back to the hotel room for more sex, she
directed him to drive aways out of town where a historic bridge crossed a
river.  She showed him where to park, then took him for a walk along the
river.  The scenery, like up in the mountains, was beautiful.It was a nice
walk and the couple were in a very serene and happy mood when they got back
in the car.

   It was early evening when they got back to town.  The other hotel in
town had a diner.  Linda wasn't thinking of the pitfalls when she and
Thomas went into the diner.  After they were seated a balding middle aged
man brought glasses of ice water to the table.  He instantly locked eyes
with Linda, glaring at her as he slammed the water into the table.  Linda
was returning the glare.  The man quickly walked away without a word. 
Linda's resolve instantly melted, "let's get out of here" she said as she
got up.

   Linda was in a full cry as they reached the front door.  She was barely
able to walk with her eyes full of tears, but was able to get in the car.
As Thomas got in, she started punching the dashboard.

   "I hate this fucking town.  I'm never going to get out out of this
fucking town" she moaned before dissolving into tears again.  Thomas pulled
her to him.  She bent over, laying her head in his lap.  An idea began to
form in his head as he put the car in gear and pulled out onto the highway.
Several minutes later, Linda composed herself enough to say:"take me home."

   "I'd like to take you someplace better, if it's alright.  I have an
idea."

   "Alright" she whimpered.

   Two hours later, Thomas pulled into the parking lot of a major
department store in his city.  He took Linda in and found the women's
department.  They found an old woman and a young lady behind a cash
register.

   "Can we help you?" the old lady challenged.

   Thomas handed her a credit card.  "Make her look fabulous, I'll be back
in an hour" he said, then leaning in he whispered "formal dinner".

   Thomas left the department store, quickly executing his plan.  Most of
what he needed was within walking distance of the store, the trick was to
make sure that the places he needed to go to were open.

   When Thomas returned to the department store he found that Linda was now
in a white gown.  Her hair was curled and the makeup on her face was
impeccable.  Thomas was in a tuxedo and he was accompanied by a man
carrying three boxes.

   "What do you think?" the young lady asked.

   "Very nice, but incomplete."

   The look on Linda's face went from a smile to a frown, but changed again
to a happy anticipation when Thomas took the first box and opened it.  He
took out a large elaborate silver necklace, inlaid with sapphires, out of
the box.  Linda gasped and her smile returned.  Thomas put the necklace on
around her neck, then returned to the man with the boxes.  He opened the
second box and took out a large bouquet of roses.  He handed the roses to
Linda, then stepped back a second.

   "And now, for the piece de resistance' " he said as he opened the third
box.

   He took out a beautiful tiara, which caused all three females to gasp.
With the help of the young lady, he placed the tiara on her head.  He
stepped back, then said, "Yes, the picture is now complete."

   He turned to the old woman and said:"It's cold outside, she'll need an
appropiate jacket."

   "I have something in her size" she said as she disppeared.

   The old woman returned a moment later with a fashionable jacket.  A
gleaming Linda looked absolutely radiant as the jacket went on.  Thomas
settled up his bill and took the credit card back.  Thomas then led Linda
from the store.

   As they went outside, Linda started to angle towards where Thomas had
parked his car.

   "Where you going?" Thomas asked.

   Linda stopped and turned back to Thomas with a quizzical look.

   "Milady, your chariot awaits" he said as he gestured towards a limo
parked near the store entrance.

   Linda's jaw dropped as Thomas stepped towards the limo and opened the
door.  Linda had only seen a limo on TV and she happily strode towards the
opened door feeling like she was living a dream.

   Thomas opened the door to the limo.  Linda started to pile in, then
stopped, trying to find a sophisticated way to glide in.  It took a couple
of tries until she got an angle she was comfortable with.  Finally inside,
she slid over on one of the bench seats.  Thomas slid in next to her.  She
cuddled up next to him, carefully cradling the roses.

   "What's next?" Linda asked.

   "Dinner fit for a Queen."

   "A Queen?"

   "You look positively radiant tonight, regal, rare, special."

   Linda gave Thomas a lingering smoldering kiss.

   "I'd make love to you here", she whispered, "but not in front of the
driver."

   He cuddled her, "we'll be there in about two minutes" he told her in a
subdued voice.

   Four minutes later the limo pulled up in front of a steakhouse.  The
building was unremarkable from the outside, but inside there was clearly a
late 1800's motif going on.  A hostess dressed as a saloon girl asked:"Can
I help you?"

   "Haden, party of two" Thomas answered.

   The hostess lit up, "Right this way" she said, leading the couple to a
spacious corner booth lit only with a trio of candles and some dim
background lighting.  Thomas slipped the hostess a twenty.  She smiled and
slinked away, motioning to a waiter.

   Within a minute, glasses of water, tea, and salads appeared on the
table.

   "Come here often?" Linda laughed.

   "Actually, I found it by accident.  When family members have visited,
I've brought them here, but this is the first time I've brought someone
here that wasn't family."

   "Are you sure?"

   "Positive.  This place, for me, is only for special occasions."

   Linda blushed, then only had a chance to take a bite when a piano
started up in the room.

   "I believe they're playing our song", Thomas said he stood up, extending
a hand.

   Thomas led her to a small dance floor about twenty feet away.  As
Journey's "Faithfully" played on the piano, he twirled her around the
floor. When the song ended, the couple returned to their booth.

   "It's the perfect night" Linda mused, "dinner, dancing, the perfect
place."

   "Actually, if we would've went to a play first, it would've been
perfect, but this was all last second."

   Linda placed a hand on his thigh.  "I think someone's going to get lucky
tonight."

   The couple were served Chateaubriand after they completed their salads.
The couple savored their dinner, pausing a couple of times to dance.

   After dinner, the limo whisked the couple off to a high rise hotel. 
Check in went fast, with the Desk Clerk telling Thomas that the clothes
they had worn to the store had been laundered and delivered to their room.
The couple then went to the nineteenth floor and entered their room. 
Thomas led Linda to a curtain and had her stay still while he turned out
the lights in the room.  Thomas then opened the curtain.

   The lights of the city, looking like multi colored gems laid out on
black velvet, spilled out before them.  Thomas walked up behind her,
wrapping his arms around her waist.

   "It's beautiful" Linda whispered as she started to gently cry.

   "What's wrong?" he asked.

   She turned to face him.  "This is the most perfect night of my life,
perfect, but tomorrow I have to go back to that shit hole."

   "You don't have to go back, if you don't want."

   "What do you mean?"

   "We'll talk to your father.  We'll convince him that it's in your best
interests to stay in the city, with me."

   "You'd do that for me?"

   "For you my Queen, milady, absolutely."

   Linda gave Thomas a smoldering kiss, then led him to the bed where they
made love deep into the night.

new reality for a pair of lovers, who would make the best of a new life.
