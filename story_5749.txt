occurred to me.  I have edited history, with some 
liberties, based on the general premise of "If I only

In reality I made a choice between two people and had 
some rich experiences, but ...

During high school I had been semi-coerced on several 
occasions into appearing in some minor roles in our 
school performances.

In my final year, a friend who was the leading man in 
that year's musical was extremely popular with the 
chorus.  As a result we found ourselves spending a great 
deal of time with the same group of girls - all a year or 
two behind us.  In addition to rehearsals they had begun 
to hang around the boys in our class during lunch and 
other breaks.

One was a friend who had shared a brief innocent passion 
with me before things cooled and we became "just good 
friends".  While on a mutual "trading insults" basis with 
a couple of the other girls, I had not found any who 
really appealed to me - I suppose because none had shown 
any special interest in me.
 
It was customary for a cast party to be held at the 
conclusion of each season (of three evening performances 
and a matinee) and Jean's family had offered their house 
for the festivities.

Only just 16, Jean was almost a year younger than me, as 
were her closer friends in the cast, Sonia, Renate, 
Margaret and Greta; the even younger cast members tended 
to keep to their own group so I had little contact with 
them.

I got there around 4:30 pm with a couple of mates.  We 
were to have an hour or so mingling before a Barbecue was 
served then a few more hours partying into the evening.

As everyone other than Jean's parents and the teachers 
present were under age, no alcohol was permitted.  It was 
therefore fortunate that the flask bottle of navy rum 
conveniently fitting into the hip pocket of my jeans was 
concealed by my jacket.

A small tent had been set up to hold the drinks and 
snacks out of the wind.  It contained a sturdy table 
where disposable cups and plates were kept until needed.  
It also provided a convenient place for us to duck out of 
sight for a couple of minutes while we added something 
extra to the soft drinks provided by our hosts.

I was with Scott and Dave chatting to a few of the girls 
and having a quiet drink.  Margaret and I had finished 
our drinks and I offered to get a refill for her.

"Do you want another Maggot?", I asked using the 
insulting nickname she had been graced with.

"No thanks", she replied.

"Anyone else?  How about you Spaz?"  I innocently 
referred to Sonia by her nickname.

Wham! Did she hit the roof.

She stormed off around the corner of the house as we 
watched in stunned silence.

"I think an apology might be in order", suggested Dave 
quietly to me.

"Yeah, I think you could be right", I agreed.

I left them and followed Sonia to where she was sobbing 
by herself in the narrow walkway at the side of the 
house.

"Hey, Sonia.  I'm sorry.  I didn't think you cared about 
it so much."

She replied with a tearful English accent, "Well I do.  
I've had to put up with it, and put up with it, and I've 
had enough."

I walked up to her and put my arms around her.  She was a 
fair bit shorter than me and my chin rested on top of her 
short black hair.

I hugged her as I promised, "I am sorry.  I didn't intend 
to upset you, just annoy you a little I guess.  No more 
nicknames from me and I'll have a word to the others.  Is 
that all right?"

She hugged me back.  We hadn't made real physical contact 
before and it felt good.

"Okay then."  She wiped her eyes and nose on a tissue.

We stood there in each others arms.  There didn't seem to 
be an appropriate moment to let go.  She was petite but 
definitely feminine and I was enjoying the experience of 
just feeling her curves pressing into me.

When she moved and looked up at me, instincts I didn't 
know I had apparently took over and I leaned down and 
gave her a soft kiss on the lips.

She responded and the kiss turned more passionate.

I had been introduced to French kissing a couple of years 
earlier at a class party at someone's home.  Somehow we 
ended up playing spin the bottle and even the "nerdier" 
types like me managed to get lucky occasionally.

In my case I was "chosen" by one of the hotter, and more 
experienced (she was the only girl pregnant in our final 
year), girls in the class.  We met in the centre of the 
circle for our kiss and I was very pleasantly surprised 
by her tongue snaking itself between my lips to wrap 
itself around mine.

An experience I wanted to repeat, it raised a not-quite-
so-enthusiastic response from another girl later, "Ew, He 
put his tongue in my mouth!"

Oh well!  You certainly can't win them all.

Sonia however, did know about such matters and was as 
willing as I to put them into practise.  We spent a 
couple of minutes getting to know the insides of each 
other's mouths before deciding we should rejoin the 
others.

We were both still at an age where we were aware of the 
comments of our peers and went back around the corner as 
individuals rather than a couple.  We liked each other 
and now respected each other a little more but weren't 
quite confident enough go public about our budding 
feelings after only one kiss.

The group welcomed us back with a little embarrassment 
and I asked, "How about the girls get their names back 
from now on?"

No-one was game to object after Sonia's outburst and the 
matter was generally settled and forgotten.

Conversations came and went as people moved in and out of 
the group.  Sonia went off with Renate after a while; I 
presume so Renate could quiz her best friend over what I 
had said to her.

I finally went back to the tent to refill my glass.  I 
was just adding a little top up when a girl I didn't know 
came into the tent.

"Hello", I said as I put away the bottle.

"Hello.  Mind if I try some?"  She nodded towards my cup.

"Not at all."  I extended my hand and she took the cup 
and had a sip.

"Nice."

I had been admiring her figure and was thinking the same 
thing myself.

She returned the cup and I took a sip as well.

"I don't think I know you."

"I'm Cilla - Jean's sister."

She certainly wasn't a younger sister, and I knew she 
wasn't at our school.

"Hi.  I'm Glyn.  You're not at our school then."  Start 
off by stating the bleeding obvious I suppose.  At least 
you get the conversation going without making any 
assumptions which could blow up on you.

"No.  I finished a year or so ago and got a job."

Okay.  She's working but doesn't look old enough to have 
moved out yet - at least she is here tonight and I don't 
see anyone coming to crash their younger sister's party 
if they didn't live at home.

"Where do you work?"

"I'm in the distribution area for the public libraries.  
We place orders from the various chains of book stores 
and package up the shipments for the libraries which want 
them."

"Do you enjoy it?"

"Yes.  There is plenty of variety, and I get a chance to 
preview a lot of books I could never afford to buy.  You 
just have to be extra careful not to make it too obvious 
that any particular copy has been read."

She smiled.  It was a nice smile and I returned it.  We 
shared another sip.

"So.  How many brothers and sisters DO you have?"

"There's seven of us - three girls and four boys.  I'm 
the oldest at eighteen and the youngest is five."

"Hmm", I thought with an internal smile, "an 'older' 
woman!"

"I'm one of six - my parents favour big families too."

We finished off the cup and I made fresh ones for both of 
us.  Cilla joined me when I walked back to the group.

Jean was there and introduced her to the others.  Sonia 
returned with Renate and they came to stand next to me on 
the other side from Cilla.  Out of the corner of my eye I 
caught Renate staring at me but she quickly turned away 
as I turned towards her.  What had Sonia said?

As the afternoon turned to dusk I had the unusual 
experience of receiving the attention of not one but two 
pleasant young women.  When dinner was served we queued 
together and as they found seats I offered to get drinks 
for both of them.

I returned with three special mixes and sat with them to 
eat my meal.  Sonia's eyes opened wide when she took her 
first sip.

"Not too strong?", I asked.

"No.  It's just that I wasn't expecting it and haven't 
really had much to drink before.  What's in it?"

"Just a little rum I expect", said Cilla as she took a 
sip of her own drink.  "You can't have much left by now."

"No, just enough for one to share."

Sonia looked back and forth between us.

"I met Cilla when she came into the tent as I was mixing 
a drink earlier."

Sonia looked a little worried.  "You're not going to say 
anything to Mum or your parents are you?", she asked 
Cilla.

I looked puzzled.

"No", Cilla responded and then looked at me.  "Sonia 
lives across the street.  She's often over here to see 
Jean."

"Oh."

We talked amongst ourselves mainly - people had been 
spread around the back yard in smaller groups to eat - 
and had been getting on well together.  Neither of the 
girls had seemed threatened by the other; perhaps they 
weren't too worried if they "lost" me - a great thought 
for my ego.

We got rid of our rubbish and settled back down again 
with our chairs facing together around a plastic table 
that had been vacated by some others.

As we talked I gently rubbed my leg along the back of 
Sonia's.  She responded with her calf smoothly sliding 
over my shin.  I mischievously repeated my actions with 
Cilla using my other leg and was pleased to get the same 
response from her.  The promise of an interesting evening 
- from one direction or another!

I put my arms down by my sides and leaned forwards.  
Trying to watch the reaction of both ladies at once I put 
a hand on each of their legs (and No, I don't have four 
hands - one leg per girl!) just above the knee and gently 
rubbed their thigh through their dresses.

They both looked at me (I had to try to split the 
difference while still talking normally and not obviously 
be looking at one or the other) and neither objected in 
word or deed.

The conversation continued and after a while, Sonia 
looked at me and asked, "Any chance of another of your 
drinks?"

I stopped what I was doing and, removing the bottle from 
my pocket, gently swished the contents around out of 
sight under the table.

"There should be enough for a strong one or a couple of 
weaker ones.  Would you like to join me?"

Most of the others had already got fresh drinks while I 
had been using the telephone book (i.e. my fingers were 
doing the walking) so the drinks tent was vacant.

"Strong or weak?"

"Strong"

"Okay, Strong then."

I half filled the cup with rum and added a splash of 
lemon.

The plates and cutlery had been cleared so the table was 
now empty and I sat in the middle.

"Come and sit next to me", I instructed.

The girls complied with Sonia on my left and Cilla on the 
right.  I gave Sonia the cup first since she had asked so 
nicely and put an arm around each girl's waist.

I declined to partake saying that I had had plenty before 
and Sonia passed the cup to Cilla who also took a drink.

As Cilla took a sip I turned to Sonia and gave her 
another kiss.  She responded firmly and I took the 
opportunity to move my hand up and around a little more 
towards her breast.

When we broke apart Cilla passed the cup back to Sonia 
and turned my head towards her and proceeded to kiss me 
as well.  My tongue slid between her lips as my right 
hand also moved up towards her breast.

Our lips parted and Sonia passed the remnants of the 
drink back to Cilla.  Not to be outdone she also claimed 
another kiss as I gently massaged her breast through the 
top of her dress.  At the same time I reached around 
Cilla and gently kneaded her breast as well.

I sat up again and hugged the two ladies to my sides, 
with a quiet but forlorn quest to gently probe for their 
nipples through a bra and a dress.

I may not have accomplished much in terms of arousing the 
girls but neither had objected to my actions and, more 
surprisingly, neither had objected to my actions with the 
other girl.  I myself, a horny seventeen (well coming up 
shortly) year old, was finding the situation terribly 
arousing and it was probably only the effect of the 
alcohol which stopped me creaming my jeans then.
