*********************************************************

Having tasted the sweet nectar of his classmate Sophie 
and her older sister Ainslie, David had hoped but not 
really expected that it might lead to similar carnal 
experiences.  An invitation to join Sophie and her 
friends at Natalie's house proved his skill to at least 
one of those friends and David now waited for another.

*********************************************************

"Natalie!  Can you get the sauce and put it on the table 
then take the cocktail sausages from the microwave and 
just drain them."

"Mum, you make too much!"

It was probably true.  Pamela would have said the same to 
her own mother in her youth and relayed what she would 
have said in response.

"Better too much than not enough.  You know the leftovers 
go the next day so there's no waste.  Just do the little 
boys' and then call everyone to grab a plate and help 
themselves.  Thanks love."

Natalie took the small red sausages from the microwave.  
Finger-sized, she understood with the sophistication of a 
teenage girl why her mother called them "little boys'" 
but hoped with a teenage girl's sense of parental 
embarrassment that her mother would not refer to them as 
such when her friends could hear.

Pamela Orbach liked fussing over the kids; they were a 
great bunch.  She was grateful her daughter wasn't out 
vandalising things, stealing cars, taking drugs - or even 
worse - smoking!  She had been young, only seventeen 
herself when she had had Natalie, and had missed much of 
her own youth as a result.  In compensation she took the 
opportunity to share her daughter's where possible.

Norman had proven himself capable of overcoming the 
setback a "little" mistake like starting a family five or 
six years earlier than he had intended and together they 
had made a reasonably successful marriage.

It wasn't hurt by his wife's petite build and youthful 
appearance; Natalie clearly took after her and standing 
them together they could be taken for sisters.  Pamela 
had kept some of the weight on her chest after nursing 
Natalie and it was inevitable she should have one or two 
laugh, and frown, lines on her face.  Her hair was also 
wavy as opposed to the straighter hair Natalie had 
inherited from her father; it was also cropped shorter 
than Natalie's shoulder-length tresses.

All in all, the boys at the party rated her an 8+ on the 
MILF scale; their eyes following her about whenever they 
could get away with it.  The consensus was that if only 
she would wear a plunging neckline her rating would go up 
another point.

Pamela was kept busy watching what had become a crowded 
table outside.  Shifting food from one half-emptied plate 
to another to relieve the congestion she looked up to see 
two of Natalie's friends coming out of Natalie's bedroom 
and going in to the bathroom together.

"Strange!  What was going on?"

Natalie was busy talking to some of the others and Pamela 
didn't want to just accuse someone of misbehaviour at a 
social function when she didn't know anything was 
actually wrong.  She picked up another dish and headed 
back into the kitchen where her husband was making a 
coffee.

"No thanks dear.  I just saw something strange and I'm 
going to check it out.  Keep an eye on this lot and see 
if anyone's up to mischief."

"Strange you say?"

"Yes but it might be nothing."

Pamela put the rinsed dishes back in the rack on the sink 
and dried her hands before going to investigate.

---

"Hey Nat."  Charlotte waved her across.  Sophie was 
picking at the food on the table, considering whether to 
get a plate or a drink first.

"Charlotte put her mouth beside Natalie's ear.  "He's 
everything Sophie said and more - and he's waiting for 
you now so don't hang around here."

Sophie couldn't hear what Charlotte was saying but she 
was sure David was getting the Charlotte Hastings' Good 
Housekeeping Seal of Cunnalingual Approval.  That was 
good.  Natalie would be happier to hear an independent 
assessment that verified Sophie's own high praise for the 
young man.

Sophie looked through the glass door dividing the inside 
and outside entertaining areas and went a sickly shade of 
grey.  Next to her, Natalie was excited that *NOW* was 
the time and Sophie hastened to grab her arm as she moved 
forward.

"Sofe - What's up?  You look like you are a ghost, let 
alone that you have seen one."

"It's worse, much worse."  She turned to face Nat and now 
Charlotte could also see the horrified expression.

"What is it Sophie?"

"I don't think Nat should go and visit David right now."

"Why?"

"Because your mother just went in there."

"*WHAT*?"  People turned towards them.

"Shush.  Trust David.  He'll probably pretend to be ill, 
maybe drunk if necessary.  He does keep secrets so we 
should be safe enough."

Sophie's appetite had gone.

---

David was leaning against the wall behind the door and 
heard the footstep a second before the door knob turned.  
The door opened and Natalie was reaching for the light 
switch.

"I don't think we need that Nat.  Come in."

David pulled her arm, gently but insistently and kicked 
the door closed as soon as she was in.  He turned her 
towards him and put his arms around her.  "Just trust me 
Nat."  His lips met hers.

Natalie reacted immediately but David persisted, his lips 
smothering any cries and his hands helping to mould her 
quite delightful curves to his body.  She stopped her 
struggles and began to respond, a little carefully at 
first but then invading his mouth with her tongue while 
returning his embrace.

"Maybe she's not so shy after all."

Pamela certainly wasn't shy, she also knew she wasn't 
likely to get much of a confession unless she had 
adequate proof.

It appears Natalie's friends may have set her up.  They 
hadn't seemed the vicious sort so she didn't think they 
plotted her rape.  It wasn't near her birthday so the boy 
currently holding her wasn't some sort of sweet 16 rite 
of passage.  Sweet sixteen - that had been her own last 
birthday as a relative innocent.

Well no-one was going to destroy Natalie's youth.  Pamela 
was suddenly bitter and contrite at the same time.  She 
had loved the little girl presented to her at the 
hospital, she had loved the toddler and the pretty girl 
going off to school.  The girl who had grown and 
blossomed and who was capable of achieving so many 
things, so many *GOOD* things, good things her mother 
hadn't.  Pamela loved Natalie with all her heart and 
would not for one minute have changed her past if it 
meant losing her daughter - but she sometimes wished and 
wondered.

What she wondered about at that moment was the boy's 
exact intentions.  This might simply have been some sort 
of truth or dare type challenge, relatively harmless 
though "naughty" and something she would have to 
officially frown on while wishing she was young enough to 
join in.

It didn't help that Norman, only a year older than her, 
had left his own youth behind and, though loving and 
providing, had seemed to blame her so that the excitement 
and spontaneity had been lacking to the extent he had 
sought it elsewhere for a while even though she would 
have loved to have met his needs if he would only meet 
hers.

The spirit of adventure that had resulted in Natalie's 
arrival had never been demonstrated again; perhaps the 
reason Natalie had been an only child.  By the time they 
were financially able their relationship had changed from 
Adam and Eve with the whole of the world to discover to 
Mum and Dad, a mortgage and school fees.

Norman was vanilla, and not even the rich vanilla of 
gelati.  No, he was the "Store's Own Brand"; an white ice 
cream that needed to have a label so they called it 
Vanilla since no-one would buy it if it was truthfully 
labelled "flavourless" or "bland".  Pamela found it easy 
to give in to the temptation to just kick up her heels 
and to play along.

If it was just playful messing around she could end up 
sharing a laugh with the others at having turned the 
tables on them.  If it was an attempt to harm her 
daughter then they would find out why a hurricane's fury 
was originally given a woman's name.

David had eased Nat away from the door, all the time 
moving his hands over her body in a sensual but not 
offensively sexual manner.  She was a surprisingly good 
kisser; David hoped for further opportunities to practise 
with her.

David would have been amazed to find Pamela thought he 
didn't need the practise, and that she too would have 
found it pleasant to meet up with him again.  Twelve 
years of marriage (Nat had been a flower girl) after 
living with Norman at her parents' during the first 
struggling years had decreased kissing to a token on 
departure or a feature of her vanilla sex.  To be the 
object of a young man's attention again, even if due to a 
case of mistaken identity, stoked her vanity.

Pamela knew she got looks, but Norman *LOOKED* - 
elsewhere.  She appreciated the little extra attention 
and let it continue.

As David's hands travelled down her back to rest on her 
butt she was about to call a halt with a "Hold it buster.  
What do you think you're doing?"  However David had 
shifted his mouth to sensuously kiss her neck and that, 
together with the feel of his hardened state as he 
pressed their clothed crotches together made her realise 
he *WAS* holding it and apparently knew very well what he 
was doing and how to go about it.

She wondered if he also realised just what he was doing 
to her!

It had been so long - far too long - since her body had 
been stimulated so completely rather than just getting 
her worked up for penetration.  She enjoyed her husband's 
love making but it had really only been fucking, not 
making love.

"God!" she thought.  "He's making my knees wobbly and he 
hasn't done anything that wouldn't happen at the end of 
any date I've ever been on.  It had been just *TOO* 
long!"

Pamela had always viewed the "leg raising up when girl is 
kissed" scenes in the Doris Day movies as farcical.  She 
understood the studios couldn't show passions being 
raised in any overt way but had never believed just 
kissing could induce such feelings.  Apparently she was 
wrong; you could teach an old dog new tricks though she 
was feeling anything but old or bitchy.

David's hands crept down the sides of her hips, holding 
her firmly against his own obvious passion with a vice-
like pressure rather than by using her ass to drive their 
bodies together.  For some reason the touch of his hands 
on the outside of her legs seemed far more personal than 
having her butt cheeks held.  He was invading her 
personal space but she felt excited rather than 
threatened.

After all it was her house and she retained some 
authority over him.  If she called a halt to the 
proceedings she only need say she had entered the room 
and he had grabbed her in the dark and started pawing at 
her.  Only he would know how little objection she had 
made at first.

*IF* she called a halt; that seemed much less attractive 
than letting him continue just a little longer.  "Enough 
rope..." she rationalised even as she felt his finger 
nails gently scraping *UP* her legs.

Pamela shivered involuntarily and felt his breath by her 
ear.  "Just trust me, you'll like it.  Charlotte did."  
His lips and teeth briefly nibbled her lobe before 
finding the centre of her face and nibbling her lips 
instead.

Pamela was more than a little relieved that her 
suspicions on seeing the other girls leaving the bedroom 
had been well founded.  It would have turned out 
exceedingly embarrassing had this simply been her 
daughter's new boyfriend.  That hadn't crossed her mind 
when he had called her Nat!

"Okay then Lothario - what is it you were going to do 
with my little girl?"  Pamela was split between outraged 
mother and lusty woman - neither wanted the unknown youth 
to stop quite yet.  His actions, as her hem lifted above 
her panties, were outrageous but had the light been on 
she wouldn't have been any more exposed than at the 
beach.

That soon changed.  Now he had definitely gone beyond the 
bounds of even impolite behaviour with his hosts' 
daughter.  Now *SHE* had gone past anything she had done 
with anyone other than her husband.  She felt, not 
"dirty" - it didn't have an air of being unclean, but 
still "naughty" didn't go far enough; perhaps "excited" 
was as close as she could get.

The question she asked herself though was, "How far do I 
want him to go?"  The answer was certainly different from 
what it would have been if she had phrased it "How far 
should I let him go?"

She had last faced that predicament nine months before 
Natalie's birth.

Pamela was enjoying herself and felt, if she didn't 
actually let him fuck her, was a little fooling around 
such a crime?  She was still curious as to where this was 
all going; perhaps it was just an elaborate game of 
chicken and she was expected to stop him at some stage.  
If so, he might be in for a shock.

Pamela was disappointed when the kissing stopped but 
David had to drop to his knees if he was going to remove 
her underwear.  Pamela let him and then sat back on her 
daughter's bed as he gently pulled her arms downwards.  
She noticed how ruffled it was.

"How many have you had in here?" she whispered.

"You're only the third.  Did you think Sophie had 
everyone lining up?"

So... Sophie and Charlotte... and Natalie!  The three had 
been inseparable for years now; it made sense.  She might 
have to take them aside and have a quiet word about their 
behaviour - or at least to compliment them on their 
choice of a paramour.  The one thing Pamela knew she 
would do before the week was out would be to see that 
Natalie had adequate contraceptive cover!

David had stretched up to kiss "Nat" again and his torso 
eased her legs apart.  He pushed her shoulders back and 
travelled down her body leaving little kisses through her 
clothes until he reached her pubes.

"Lift a second please."  Her skirt was under her butt and 
covered the place he wanted most to visit.

Pamela lifted her hips and let him bare her body.  His 
breath tickled her skin and she shivered.  His mouth was 
right next to her pussy and he was kissing her thigh, her 
bush and, yes, over her lips.  Norman had never been 
orally inclined, even blowjobs hadn't interested him 
until he had strayed; other than a couple of times when 
they were first going out and he was trying to impress 
her she hadn't had *ANYONE'S* lips pressed there.

David soon impressed her even more, his tongue delving 
through the crack where her lips met and into her chamber 
of secret desire.  He had done his groundwork properly 
and she was flooded.  If this kept up he wouldn't have 
room for salad and steak - he certainly was filling up on 
dessert.

Pamela was concerned he was stopping when he had only 
just started her motor running but it was only a brief 
interruption.

"You'd better not tell the others but you taste nicer 
than even Charlotte."

Pamela could tell from his voice that this was apparently 
high praise.  He proceeded to prove how much he liked the 
taste and Pamela was suddenly envious of her daughter and 
her friends.  They were young and had their whole lives 
ahead of them and there were boys, young men, out there 
who would do *THIS* for them willingly.  She regretted 
that, except for this one illicit meeting, she probably 
wouldn't be able to enjoy it with them.

It made her even more determined to enjoy this time.  She 
didn't even care if her husband came to see where she had 
gone - perhaps he could learn something, if only not to 
take her needs for granted!  She would have to have 
another talk with him about his former "girlfriend"; if 
he could give her what she wanted then he damn well 
better do it for *HER* as well.

Pamela held her breasts through her top, cursing the bra 
that stopped her nipples feeling more than an attenuated 
touch.  Oh, it was lovely.  The boy was talented, finding 
every spot she needed caressed and doing just that.

As her body reacted to the orgasm David induced she 
gripped the bedspread with clawed fingers and bit into 
the webbed flesh between thumb and finger to stifle her 
cries.  She had never been a screamer with Norman; he had 
never given her this sort of cause.  She began to hate 
him a little.

Who *WAS* this youth?  Perhaps she was better off not 
knowing.  Did she want the temptation to take him to bed 
whenever she saw him again.  Perhaps a fantasy lover 
would be better - she could play with herself, 
remembering these moments while Norman slept soundly 
beside her.

David let her relax, slipping out from under her legs and 
lying on the bed next to her.  There wasn't a third 
person already cuddling her this time so he slipped an 
arm under her head and drew it down to rest on his chest 
as well.  Nothing was said as they lay there together, 
Pamela's pulse gradually slowing to a more normal rate.

"Thank you", she said and lifted her head to kiss him 
this time.

Her hand bumped the end of his erection as she moved her 
arm over his body to support herself over him.  Instead 
of giving him his kiss she asked, "That feels pretty 
hard, hasn't anyone done anything about it?"

"Not yet.  I'm on sort of a promise but it doesn't matter 
if that doesn't happen."

"Oh a promise should be kept.  What's supposed to happen 
to it?"  If he asked she felt she would be quite happy 
then and there to throw a leg over his hips and to fuck 
him, and perhaps herself, senseless.

"Nothing specific, just that I might get it taken care of 
later."

"Well how about I see you don't get forgotten."  It was 
definitely only a rhetorical question as Pamela was 
unzipping his pants even as she spoke.

"Nice!"  David's penis was warm to touch, a little sweaty 
and she hoped not disgusting to taste.  Size-wise it was 
near enough to her husband's equipment but the end had a 
collar of skin while her husband's knob was bald.  As it 
slid back and forth she wondered what difference the men 
noticed.  Too bad if you got clipped and then decided you 
liked a foreskin!

Pamela moved around the bed and leaned over David's 
pelvis.  She extended her tongue and tested the taste - 
she could always give him a hand job.

David had been kept on the verge of his own release for 
an hour now.  His body, experiencing repeated cycles of 
excitement and relaxation, had oozed pre-cum for much of 
that time and enough of the sweeter emission had coated 
him that Pamela actually enjoyed the taste.  She wrapped 
her hand around the base of his pole and her lips around 
the top.

Pamela had only a little more experience with fellatio 
than with cunnalingus.  She was enthusiastic but not 
terribly skilled.  David, expecting no more from the 
nervous novice Natalie - and not even having expected the 
offer in the first place - was simply grateful for an end 
to the torment his balls were putting him through.

Boys had lied to their girlfriends about the need to come 
for years but the element of truth in their stories was 
that it did hurt if they had been kept excited for a 
prolonged period.  Blue balls were more than just a joke 
and the poor male experiencing them found little to joke 
about.

On the good side, the pain does fade soon enough once the 
stimulation stops even without a release but what 
teenager is going to tell his girlfriend "you have to 
stop" when he could say "you have to keep going - only 
harder".

Pamela knew to bob her head while sucking, her ideas of 
letting her tongue roam around were less developed.  
David had no intention of directing her - he was enjoying 
whatever she did and caught on the dilemma of wanting it 
to come to an appropriate end (where he came) and to have 
it last forever and ever.

His body listened to his wishes and came down on the side 
of immediacy.  He didn't have a chance to say more than 
"Wait Nat I'm..." when he was.

Pamela gulped as his semen hit her throat.  She kept 
gulping as each subsequent emission leapt clear over the 
length of her tongue.  His was only the second cum she 
had swallowed - you got one free and then had to *REALLY* 
pay for any others.

She was quite proud that she managed the whole lot 
without spilling a drop - the first time she had spewed 
it all up in Norman's lap with her earlier meal; maybe 
the reason he wasn't enthusiastic about oral sex.

She let the wilting organ drop from her lips and went to 
lay back down again.  David surprised her yet again, over 
and above everything else he had done, when he put a 
finger under her chin and kept her moving up where they 
could kiss.

He certainly didn't object to the residual taste - it was 
something his instructors (Justin and the four girls) had 
emphasised.  He should know what his own cum tasted like 
before expecting some girl to find out and he should show 
her that he didn't consider her defiled after she had 
gifted him her mouth.

Norman even disliked masturbation if he got cum on his 
hands!

It was his turn to say "Thank you" and, after another 
couple of briefer kisses - it was hard for Pamela to say 
goodbye - Pamela had to get up.

"I have to go.  I'm likely to be missed.  Thanks again 
and don't forget to do up your zip."

David closed his eyes as he lay back and missed seeing 
her silhouette; even then he may not have picked the 
differences - he hadn't during the half hour they had 
been together.

---

Pamela closed the door behind her and ducked into the 
bathroom.  Now she understood the others' action.  She 
snibbed the door and brushed her teeth.  Being willing to 
swallow the lad's cum was one thing, putting up with the 
taste another.  She ran the hot tap and wet a washer.

"Damn!"

Pamela tried to think where in the room her knickers had 
ended up.  She didn't want to go back now - haven't 
gotten away with her outrageous behaviour she didn't want 
to risk her quiet life a second time.  She decided to 
grab a clean pair and just hope anyone who did see them 
before she could get back in there would just think 
Natalie a little lazy.

She didn't expect the delegation waiting for her in the 
lounge.

She now knew what they had been up to, it looked they 
were equally aware of her activities.  She tried to bluff 
her way through with an outrageous yet, to anyone else, 
quite innocent statement.

"It's such a lovely party darling.  You'll have to invite 
your friends over again.  Soon."

She went to replace her underwear before they had a 
chance to comment.

---

David turned on the light, checking his appearance and 
straightening out Natalie's bed.  The knickers on the 
floor were obvious and he tucked them under her pillow.  
Nat could disappear into her room to collect them with 
less risk than if he tried to pass them to her.

The three girls were alone in the lounge as he came out.  
That was a bit of a relief as someone might have noticed 
Natalie returning to the party even though he had given 
her a couple of minutes head start.  Ignoring their 
somewhat bemused looks he bent over next to Natalie and 
whispered in her ear.  "Thanks again.  I left your 
knickers under your pillow."

He didn't notice bemusement become horror as his own 
satisfied expression changed to one of puzzlement; 
Natalie was wearing jeans!

He looked up at Nat's face.  She though had turned 
elsewhere and David followed her gaze.  Another girl - No 
woman - definitely Nat-like though, stood in the doorway.

"Mum, this is David.  David, my mother.  I believe you 
might have met."

Pamela had the grace to blush at the slight chill in her 
daughter's voice.

David just knew the heavens were going to open and a 
thunderbolt would strike him where he stood - never 
before had he told such a bare-faced lie when it was 
obvious that everyone present knew it was such.

"No.  I don't think so.  Hello."
