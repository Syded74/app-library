"I told you, Wilson, I want to go to City Hall and get it over with. End of story." House was channel-surfing and not looking at his fiancé. "And I'm not wearing a suit."

Wilson sat on the end of the couch. "House, you have to understand. I've been married three times, and each time the bride's family paid for it. My mother has been dying to have a real wedding in the family, but she has three boys—"

"One of them locked in the loony bin—"

"And now that we're getting married, all she wants is for us to have a real wedding."

"The mother of the bride can fulfill her fantasies by watching 'Whose Wedding Is It Anyway' on the Style Channel. No." House slid down further into the coach, staring at the flat screen with ferocious concentration.

"Please, House. Do it for my folks. Do it for your mother. Make her happy for a change."

"Happy," House said with a snort. "When I told her about us, she screamed and hung up the phone."

"That was last year. I'm sure she's come to terms with it. Damn, House, if my folks can bring themselves to spring for a wedding, the least you can do is put on a tuxedo and mock the guests. You can even mock my family."

House groaned. "You are such a girl."

"You are such a dick."

"I thought that's what you loved about me. My enormous stiff-stander. Go to your happy place and imagine me fucking your brains out. AFTER we go to the justice of the peace."

Wilson paced the room in agitation. "Fine! You want to spoil everything? Fine. You want to disappoint our families? Fine. You want to have some furtive little ceremony like I'm some hooker you knocked up? Fine."

Wilson was about to storm into the bedroom when House's voice stopped him.

"Okay, you win. As long as it's simple. That's all I ask."

Mr. and Mrs. Wilson sat uncomfortably opposite House and Wilson in the restaurant booth. In the back. Very far in the back. Almost in the kitchen back. It was upscale French, with white tablecloths and fine crystal. And conveniently off the beaten track, so no one would run into them.

"Mom, we're very grateful to you for this, but we want to keep it simple," said Wilson. He had clearly inherited his looks from his mother, whose dark brown hair was streaked with gray. Mr. Wilson had a large paunch and a thick, soft neck, which did not bode well for Wilson's aging process.

"I thought fags liked everything flamboyant," Mr. Wilson grumbled.

"Calvin! Do not use that language in front of your son and his…friend."

"I'm not his friend, I'm his fuck-buddy," House said. His hand found Wilson's crotch, and rubbed it gently.

"House!" Wilson jumped a little, then steadied himself. "T-the term is partners, Mom."

"Life partners," said House with an evil grin, slowly unzipping Wilson's fly. Despite its owner's sense of propriety, it was getting hard. Wilson could not wiggle away from House; he was on the inside corner of the booth. House slipped his hand into the slit of Wilson's briefs, and gently tugged out Wilson's penis. He slid one finger along one side.

"Yes, er, life partners, although sometimes I don't think, er, life is quite appropriate." Wilson shot House a glare and squeezed as hard as he could into the restaurant wall.

"Maybe this'll last longer than your real marriages," Mr. Wilson said.

"Oh, it'll last," said House. "It will be long, and strong, and really good." He closed his fingers around Wilson's dick.

"House!" Wilson's voice shot up an octave. "I don't think that's appropriate—language—to use about—"

"Our union?" House was stroking him now, using the pretext of leaning over so that their shoulders touched, for easier access.

"Don't make me think about it." Mr. Wilson grimaced. Wilson flushed, but it was not from shame.

"You don't want to think about us in bed?" House continued. "About our being naked? About our kissing each other?"

"House," Wilson gasped.

House turned Wilson's face to his and gave him a long, soulful kiss, to conceal the fact that at the same time he was jerking his partner hard. Wilson climaxed, his face shoved into House's, which was fortunate because it hid Wilson's expression.

"Now that's just disgusting!" Wilson's father exclaimed.

Wilson wiped the sweat off of his face. "Dad, we've talked about this—"

"You mean you've talked about this, Jimmy. One of my boys turned out a schizo and one a fag…there's only one normal son in this family."

"Yeah, and he's a violent drunk who beats his wife and terrorizes his kids. That's normal," said House.

Their food came, and while the waitress was serving the food and pouring wine, the group sat silent. As soon as she left, Mr. Wilson started to speak, but his wife cut him off. "I apologize for your father. Jimmy—"

"His name is James," House snapped.

"House, she's my mother. She can call me what she wants."

"Jimmy, I want you to have a beautiful wedding." Her brown eyes widened pleadingly. "I was thinking, we have that big backyard, and well, I've always dreamed of planning my daughter's wedding. We didn't have a wedding, you know, just a civil ceremony. Every time you've gotten married, I've envied the mothers of the bride—brides. Please let me have this."

"All right, Mom."

####################################################

"Oh my god! My three ex-wives as bridesmaids? My brother as best man? Mom, what are you thinking? It's not going to be a ceremony, it's going to be a ritual sacrifice!"

Mrs. Wilson smiled happily at her son. "Well, now, House can't be your best man, can he?"

"But Peter-? Mom, I don't even want him there. He'll make a drunken scene, and Bonnie will lock herself in the bathroom." Wilson rubbed his face in his hands. "House is gonna kill me."

"Jimmy, it's all been arranged. The invitations have been sent out."

"You made the invitations without telling me?"

His mother pouted prettily. "I told you, I'd take care of everything." She produced a card from the end table next to the flowered couch and handed it to him. Wilson gasped at the elaborate calligraphy, the flowery wording, and worst, the cherubs on all four corners of the card.

"House cannot see this," Wilson gargled. "Not only will he kill me, he'll dissect me! Next you'll want him to wear a wedding dress!"

"No, Jimmy, you're the bride." Mrs. Wilson sighed contentedly. "At last, I have a daughter."

Wilson stared down at his mother and had a sickening thought.

Now he knew where Danny had inherited his schizophrenia.
