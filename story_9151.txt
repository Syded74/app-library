Sharon hit the snooze button. Another boring day at work lay ahead of her. She 
went through the usual boring routine, showering, dressing, feeding her cat 
Sylvester, grabbing a granola bar on the way out and driving to work. The job 
wasn't bad, mind you, but database administration wasn't exactly the center of 
excitement. Worse, she had to wear "business" attire: no pants, no bare legs, 
modest top. She wasn't an exhibitiionist, but she didn't like to shop at the 
House of Frump, either. 

She arrived at work and logged onto her computer. Great, a few minutes early. 
Time to visit her favorite site, Female Fashion Forum. The girls at FFF could 
use her impeccable fashion sense and she felt it her duty to dish out advice. 
Laura poked her head in the cube. "Hey, Sharon , what's up?"

"Same old crap. I wish something exciting would happen. By the way, that top 
would look better if you untucked it just a bit from your skirt."

"You think so? I'll try it. Thanks."

"See you at lunch?"

"Sure, usual bench."

Looking back at her screen, she saw a private message from a FFF user. This 
from a girl with username "Porcupine". Odd name, but she opened it.

>>> Porcupine>>> Since you're such an expert, I was wondering what you are 
wearing to work today.

She sent back a PM to Porcupine: 
>>> FashionBug>>>Today it is a navy blue skirted suit with a white blouse.

Then it was back to work. At morning break another PM from Porucpine:
>>> Porcupine>>> Wow, nothing underneath it? You're more fun than I thought 
you'd be.

Ha ha, isn't she the funny one. She fired one back: 

>>>FashionBug>>> Porcupine, I'm sorry but I'm not that much fun. I have the 
usual underwear and pantyhose, you know panties, bra, camisole. Thanks for the 
laugh.

As she worked up to lunch, she wondered why in the world another girl would 
want to know what she was wearing. Oh well, maybe she wants to dress like me 
and just is too bashful to ask. Finally, lunch time came and she met Laura. 
"Hey, Laura, would you ever want to know what underwear I'm wearing?"

Laure looked at her like she lost her mind. "You know, strangely enough that's 
never been a concern of mine. The way we have to dress around here, you'd 
never see it anyway."

"It's just that one of the FFF girls asked me. I thought it was odd."

“What the hell is FFF?”

“Female Fashion Forum. One of the users sent me a private message.”

“So did you tell her?"

"Well, yes."

"So what's the problem? She's a stranger on the internet. She knows you wear 
underwear. BFD."

"I suppose you're right. Anyway, maybe she just wants to know what's stylish." 


Laura rolled her eyes at that one. "Well, I've got to get back and use the 
potty before lunch ends." They walked back in and up to the office.

Sharon logged back on. A few minutes of FFF. Another message from Porcupine! 
>>> Porcupine>>> FashionBug, what color/type underwear? Also hose and shoes? 
Boy, was she getting nosy! Still, a lot of girls might need to know the proper 
underwear for a skirted suit.

>>> FashionBug>>> Porcupine, I have a white back hook bra and cami of course. 
Only white for under white. Always. And the panties are white brief cut. 
Always match panty and bra. Always. Tan control top hose. Blue pumps to match 
skirt. Satisfied? 
Moments later, another message!

>>> Porcupine>>> FashionBug, are panties over or under your hose?

Of all the nerve! Sharon wanted to just go ahead and block Porcupine's 
messages but still responded:
>>> FashionBug>>> Porcupine, Under, of course! Why would you wear them over? 
With that she got back to work. She was upset that she even responded to her. 
She found herself distracted and making silly mistakes as the day wore on. 
Finally the afternoon break came and she logged back onto FFF.

>>> Porcupine>>> Because number one they show up better. Why bother wearing 
nice panties if nobody can see them through your hose? Number two they come 
off easier when you get a little naughty.

What a little slut! Sharon thought and quickly banged on the keys:
>>>FashionBug>>> Maybe some girls take off their panties but I sure don’t. And 
you wear nice underwear for yourself, not for someone to see.

The reply came back in seconds:
>>> Porcupine>>> Tomorrow I want you to try to wear them over.

All right, this has gone too far. 
>>> FashionBug>>> I’m sorry but I’m not into that sort of thing. It would be 
best if you didn’t send me any more PMs.

>>> Porcupine>>> Let me know when you come around to doing it my way.

That was it. She wouldn’t respond to this one. Back to work. She concentrated 
as best she could on her work. What kind of perverts are on the net, anyway? 
At home she tried to take her mind off it. It would be a good day to organize 
her undewear drawer. She folded her bras and pantyhose and started to work on 
her panties. Let’s see, pantyhose in the middle, bras on the right side, 
panties on the outside….what am I saying? That’s it, maybe I need to take a 
break from FFF. 

The next day she got to her cube and instead of logging into FFF she did a 
Sudoku puzzle. Laura popped in the cubicle. “Hey there, how are you today?”

“Oh I’m OK. I cut off the conversation with that girl from yesterday. She 
wanted me to do something strange and I wasn’t going to.”

“Do tell. What was so strange?”

“She wanted me to wear my panties over my pantyhose.”

Laura kept staring at her as if Sharon was going to add something. “That’s it? 
Maybe it’s for the best. Maybe she’s the type to put her spoons on the left 
side of the plate, too. Or maybe she doesn’t hang her dresses in her closet so 
that the colors are in the same order as the rainbow.”

“Don’t be silly. Dresses are hung in order of hem length.”

“See? You’re a tight ass. Everything is so rigid with you and you just can’t 
do different things.”

“Yes I can but this is just….different.”

“I rest my case.” Laura went back to her cube. Was she being too rigid? Was 
she afraid to try something new? She thought about that as she worked until 
morning break. Then she headed to the ladies room. When she got back, she 
logged back onto FFF. 



Sharon and Laura- Part 2 Trying New ThingsTue Aug 28, 
2007 06:0124.11.161.5

>>> FashionBug>>> I switched them at break. Panties are now over instead of 
under. Happy?

>>> Porcupine>>> Very good. I’m proud of you! Now wear them like that every 
day. What are you wearing today? Be very complete and descriptive.

Of all the nerve! Daring to tell her what to wear! She fought the urge to 
block her PMs and instead answered:
>>> FashionBug>>> Today is a red knee length dress with half sleeves and a 
high neckline, coming just below knee. White full slip and red bra and panty, 
nude pantyhose.

>>> Porcupine>>> What is the name of your convent? What a boring outfit. 
Tomorrow you’re going to wear a skirt that buttons up the front. We’re going 
to have some fun.

That did it! Now she’s gone too far.

>>> FashionBug>>> This is a business office! We have to dress respectably.

>>> Porcupine>>> And a skirt that buttons up the front isn’t respectable why?

>>> FashionBug>>> Well it can be but, well I don’t know.

>>> Porcupine>>> You DO know and you want to do it, you just don’t have the 
guts.

>>> FashionBug>>> That’s it- goodbye.

What kind of freak was she dealing with, anyway? God what was she thinking 
when she changed her panties to the outside? It was back to work. The rest of 
the morning went by so quickly she couldn’t believe it was lunchtime. She 
found Laura in the usual spot. “Guess what I did today?”

“Oh let me guess, you pulled a tag off a mattress?”

“Smart ass.” She leaned forward and whispered. “I put my panties on over my 
hose.” 

“Oh my God, how DARING! I wish I had HALF of your courage! How ARE the men 
able to stay away from you now?”

“And you know what, she had the nerve to tell me to wear a front button skirt 
tomorrow. And by the way, I think a higher heel would be better with your 
skirt.”

“See there you go again. Offering advice but never taking it. What’s wrong 
with your green skirt that buttons?”

“Well nothing.”

“So there you go. Upset over nothing again. You’re asked to wear a skirt that 
you’ve already worn to the office. Wow, you better call the FBI.”

“Gosh, I don’t know. This is so confusing.”

“That’s all right. Just be confident and do what you want.” Lunchtime finally 
passed and Sharon was left to ponder this for the rest of the day and night. 
Somehow she found her experience with Porcupine to be, dare she say, erotic. 
Morning came and she pondered her choices. What was wrong with that green 
skirt anyway? She left for work early and logged onto FFF.

>>>FashionBug>>> Today I have a green skirt that buttons up the front, pale 
yellow blouse and yellow bra and panties. The panties are over tan hose and I 
have green pumps on. The skirt is knee length.
With some trepedation, she hit SEND. 

>>>Porcupine>>> I’m glad you obeyed. How many buttons does the skirt have and 
does it button all the way up to your waist?

>>> FashionBug>>> Eight. Yes.

>>> Porcupine>>> Excellent. No more hesitation now, understand?

Without knowing why, she typed the reply:
>>> FashionBug>>> Understood.

>>> Porcupine>>> Good. Let’s get those panties off. Slide them off right where 
you are.

She might have known this was coming. Still, who would know. She hooked her 
fingers into her waistband and pulled them down her legs and off, then put 
them in her desk drawer.

>>> FashionBug>>> They’re off.

>>> Porcupine>>> Undo the bottom two buttons of your skirt.

How far was she going to go? And why was she doing it?

>>> FashionBug>>> Undone. Now I need to start work. 
Good lord, what had she done? And why was this so exciting? She looked down at 
herself and 2 buttons just revealed a touch of thigh above the knee, certainly 
not something that would be noticed. When the morning break came, she stopped 
in Laura’s cube. “See, I’m not as stuffy as you think.”

“Ooh, Miss Fashion has two buttons undone. Knee alert! Are the panties over or 
under today?”

“They WERE over.”

Laura’s lifted an eyebrow in disbelief. “And now?”

“In my drawer.” 

Laura sat in stunned silence for a moment. “Okay, maybe you are a little less 
rigid than I thought.”

“Damn right. I don’t know why, but this is fun.”

“I still can’t believe it. See you at lunch?”

“Of course.”

Sharon walked back to her cube and had a minute before break was over. 
>>>FashionBug>>> I am back.

>>>Porcupine>>> One more button.

She knew this was coming, perhaps she wanted it to come.
>>>FashionBug>>> Done. Back to work now.

Three buttons undone. Now her inner thighs were exposed a few inches above the 
knee. More than she had ever shown before. Why was she doing this? She could 
hardly wait for lunch to come. As she walked to the bench where Laura was 
waiting she could sense some air on her thighs. 

“Holy cow, I can’t believe you’re doing this”

“Neither can I. This is getting too distracting for me. I know I should quit.”

“So why don’t you?”

“Because maybe you’re right. Maybe I do need to loosen up a little. Maybe this 
is what I need. I’m not going to stop.”

Sharon and Laura- Part 3 Playing with FireTue Aug 28, 
2007 06:2224.11.161.5

After lunch Sharon had a moment to log back into FFF. 

>>>FashionBug>>> I’m back.

>>> Porcupine>>> Two more buttons

Tha would only leave three. But without hesitation she obeyed.

>>> FashionBug>>> Done. Now the skirt has fully opened up. You can see where 
my panties would be if I still had them on.

>>> Porcupine>>> Well done. I’ll leave you like that for today. Tomorrow 
you’re going to wear a dress that buttons up at least as far as the waist. It 
needs a zipper in back too. You’re going to wear panties over the hose so you 
can slip them off. In fact, this is now a requirement for you from now on. You 
may wear a bra but no cami. When you drive home today it will be with the 
skirt removed. You will obey these and all further instructions to the letter 
and without hesitation. Is that understood?

Sharon ’s hands trembled as she sent the reply.

>>> FashionBug>>> Yes.

So that was it. She was going to let this go wherever it was going. She could 
think of nothing else the rest of the day. As she got in her car, she undid 
the last three buttons and pulled the skirt off to the side. She didn’t know 
how she managed to get home as she was almost dizzy with excitement. She 
pulled the skirt under her and fastened the waist button and casually walked 
up to her apartment. Once there, it came off. She searched her closet for a 
dress that met the requirements and came up with her light blue print dress. 
She made sure it wasn’t too see thru and set it out for the next day. A blue 
bra and panties were set out as well. 

After a restless night with lttle sleep the alarm sounded again. She quickly 
got up and fed Sylvester then got into the required outfit. She rushed to work 
to have plenty of FFF time before work.

>>> FashionBug>>> I have a blue print dress with six buttons on the skirt part 
going from hem to waist. The zipper is on the back and goes down to my waist. 
The dress comes just over the knee. Under it I have a blue bra and panty set. 
And under that, nude pantyhose.


She trembled as she awaited Porcupine’s response. Then the window flashed.

>>> Porcupine >>> Pull the dress up to your waist so that you’re sitting on 
your panties. This is how you’re going to sit all day.

What to do? Well if someone did come in she could always quickly stand up and 
they’d be none the wiser. She pulled the dress up from under her.

>>> FashionBug>>> Done. I can’t believe I’m doing this.

>>> Porcupine>>> For now, let’s undo only the bottom button. I’ll let you 
think about your fate for a while. Get back on at 10:00 .

>>> FashionBug>>> Done. 
She thought she’d have undone more by now. Half disappointed and half 
relieved, she got started on work. At morning break, Laura came by.

“Hey Sharon what’s….. WHAT? Do you know how you are sitting?”

“Yes, as a matter of fact I do.”

“Have you lost your bird? Why?”

"I was told to by the woman online."

"So she tells you to sit like this and you do?"

“Pretty much. It’s fun. Why not?”

“I don’t know, a little thing like keeping your job.”

“So if someone comes I stand up. As you would say, BFD.”

Laura shook her head slowly. “Don’t say I didn’t try to stop you” she said as 
she walked away.

Finally. Ten o’clock. 

>>>FashionBug>>> I’m ready.

She couldn’t believe herself. Why not just say "strip me now?"

>>> Porcupine>>> Very good. Two more buttons.

Sharon trembled as she undid the next two, leaving only three. 
>>> FashionBug Done>>>

>>> Porcupine>>> Nice. Now take off your bra, right where you sit. 

Sharon shuddered. She wasn’t expecting that. She reached behind her and undid 
the clasp, then pulled one arm into her sleeve and through her bra strap. Then 
she pulled her bra out the other sleeve. Standard girl trick. She put it in 
her desk drawer.

>>> FashionBug>>> It’s off and in the drawer. 

>>> Porcupine>>> Good job. We’ll see you again after lunch. 

>>> FashionBug>>> I’ll be here.

She was already sitting when Laura approached her at lunch. Her dress had 
opened slightly but instead of fixing it, she let it be.

"OK if I sit here or are you trying to attract a group of sailors?"

"Very funny. What's a little bit of thigh at lunch?"

"Oh nothing I suppose. This is just so out of character for you."

"And guess what? I took my bra off. The only thing under the top is me."

"You're playing with fire, girl."

"I know. And it's hot."

They got back from lunch a bit late so there wasn't time to log on. She sat as 
she was instructed and logged back on at the afternoon break.

>>> FashionBug>>> I was late from lunch. I'm back.

>>> Porcupine>>> Panties off.

She had expected this earlier and without hesitation she slid them down her 
legs and off and into the drawer.

>>> FashionBug>>> They're off and in the drawer. 

>>> Porcupine>>> Undo the rest of the buttons.

Her hands trembled as she undid them from bottom to top. Her most intimate 
parts were now fully exposed to anyone who might enter her office.

>>> FashionBug>>> They're all undone now. 

>>> Porcupine>>> Let's get the shoes off now.

She slid the shoes off and left them on the floor.

>>> FashionBug>>> Shoes are off.

>>> Porcupine>>> Unzip the dress

She heart pounded as she reached back and pulled the zipper down.

>>> FashionBug>>> I'm unzipped.

Just then she heard footsteps and Laura's voice.

"Hi, I just came to see how---- HOLY SHIT!"

< TO BE CONTINUED>




Sharon and Laura- Part 4 ConclusionTue Aug 28, 2007 
16:1724.11.161.5

Sharon jumped. "Don't scare me like that."

Laura whispered "I can't believe you. You're really going to get naked aren't 
you?"

"I have no idea. That's the fun is not knowing and not controlling."

"Are you nuts? You don't have to be Mary Poppins, but being Suzie Slut isn't 
any better."

"Just go back before I change my mind."

Laura left and Sharon pondered her fate again. Would she go all the way?

>>> Porcupine>>> Pull the shoulders of your dress down to your elbows.

Why not? She had already gone this far. She pulled the shoulders down to her 
elbows. The dress was virtually off her.

>>> FashionBug>>> Done. 

>>> Porcupine >>> Are you ready?

She could only guess what that meant.

>>> FashionBug>>> Yes.

>>> Porcupine >>> Take the dress off and put it in your drawer.

This was it. The moment of truth. She eased her forearms out of her sleeves. 
Now for the big step. She eased off her seat and pulled the dress to her feet, 
then kicked it back to her and she tossed it in her drawer.

>>> FashionBug >>> I can't believe it. I did it!

>>> Porcupine>>> Take your pantyhose off now. Put them in the drawer.

There was little difference between being in her current state and being 
totally nude anyway. She pulled the hose down her thighs, then picked up her 
legs one at a time to pull the pantyhose off. She tossed it in her drawer. She 
did it! Totally naked at work!

>>> FashionBug>>> You did it. I am now completely naked.

>>> Porcupine>>> Lock the drawer.

Sharon took her keys and found the right one, locked the drawer, and sat the 
keys down.

>>> FashionBug>>> It is locked.

>>> Porcupine>>> Now toss the keys way under your desk

Sharon tossed them way under the desk. She'd have to crawl on her hands and 
knees to retrieve them.

>>> FashionBug>>> The keys are tossed where it's hard to get to.

>>> Porcupine>>> Put your feet up on your desk about three feet apart. Get 
yourself off. When you're finished let me know.

Sharon couldn't get those feet up fast enough. Her hand quickly found its way 
to a very wet crotch. She began to rub, but instead of starting slow like she 
usually did, she went directly to the furious hard rubbing. She quickly came, 
not hearing the footsteps approaching. Finally she came down to earth and put 
her feet down.

"Ahem"

She froze in horror. She looked back, hoping it was Laura. "Mr. Matthews!"

"Get dressed and get to my office right away!"

"Yes sir!"

Mr. Matthews was the division head. What has she done? Would she be fired? She 
knelt down to retrieve her keys, then unlocked the drawer and quickly dressed. 
She didn't want to keep Matthews waiting and entered his office.

"Close the door behind you." Sharon couldn't look him in the eye.

"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what came over me. It will never happen again."

Matthews thought for a moment. "Your work record is very good. Up until now 
you haven't caused any trouble. Until today. Let me warn you that if this is 
repeated, you're fired."

"Thank you sir, I'll never do this again."

"However, I'm sure you know you were one of the finalists for the vacant 
supervisory position in your unit. I'm afraid you've disqualified yourself for 
that one. But if you keep your nose clean for a few years, who knows?"

"I understand. Thank you." She got up to leave. 

Matthews punched some numbers on the phone. "Laura, please come to my office."

Sharon slunk back to her cube and sent a message:
>>> FashionBug>>> I can't do this anymore. I got caught naked at work.

Laura returned from Matthews' office. She got the promotion! Too bad it was at 
Sharon's expense, but that's the way it had to be. She sat in front of her 
computer and sent out a message:

>>> Porcupine>>> Sorry you got caught at work. But after work, you're still 
mine.

Matthews never did ask Sharon why she left a note asking him to stop by her 
office at 3:00. Perhaps if he had, Sharon would have caught on. As it turned 
out, she never figured it out.
