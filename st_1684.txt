Palindrome

She enjoyed my closeness, and I felt her breathing quicken as she 
nodded.

"Do you want to go to my place?" I asked softly, my lips brushing 
her ear.

She shook her head, her expression unreadable.

"Would you like to go someplace... else?"

Nodding evenly, she looked at me with twinkling grey eyes.

We walked onto the terrace, into the bracing night air. "Are you 
cold?" I asked.

"Not when I'm with you," she said.

"Are you worried?"

She shook her head, sensing my anxiousness.

"What if someone sees us? Are you scared?" I asked.

She thought about it for a only moment and then shook her head. 
Then she paused; finally, she nodded, a guilty smile on her face.

We walked back into the house, full of party guests--our friends, 
our spouses--and it was stifling. "I want to make love to you," I 
whispered in her ear, my breath warming her cool alabaster skin.

She thought about it for a only moment and then shook her head.
