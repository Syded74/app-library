<P>Meagan fetched her cell phone from her room, put it on speaker
mode, and called her mother.</P>
<P>Before she or Peter could even say hello, Debbie started talking
quickly.  "Meagan, what's wrong?  Is Peter still there?  If so,
tell him to leave.  Did the two of you argue?  Has he left?  Tell him
to come back and apologize again.  For that matter, I'll apologize
again.  Is there anything you need while I'm out?"</P>
<P>In disgust, Meagan yelled, "Fuck Mom!  Stop babbling!" and
hung up the phone.  She sent her mother a text message saying: If U
promise to B quiet &amp; listen, I'll call U back.</P>
<P>The teen received a message back saying OK almost instantly, so
she redialed her mother.  
</P>
<P>There was a deep breath from the other end of the phone, and Peter
said, "Just chill out Mrs. D."</P>
<P>"Yeah, you promised to be quiet!"</P>
<P>"I'll be good," Debbie said quietly.</P>
<P>After waiting a moment to make sure her mother was really
listening, Meagan continued, "You can come home.  Peter and I will
pose for you again."</P>
<P>There was a squeal of delight followed by a thud.</P>
<P>"I think she dropped the damn phone," Meagan stated, and Peter
nodded in agreement.</P>
<P>"Are you still there?  I dropped the phone and cracked the LCD,
but it seems like it might still be working."</P>
<P>"You're coming through loud and clear Mrs. D," Peter said.</P>
<P>"That's great news!  People are looking at me like I'm crazy,
but I don't care.  I'll be home as quickly as I can.  No, I'll be
home faster than that!"</P>
<P>"They're looking at you like you're crazy because you are
crazy," Meagan muttered after hanging up.  "We did agree my mom
was crazy, right?"</P>
<P>Peter laughed, "We mentioned it a time or three."</P>

<P>Debbie made a great deal of noise unlocking the door, then rushed
down to her studio.  "How come you decided to pose again Meagan? 
Wait, I don't care; I'm just happy I get to paint again.  Pose
however you want, I'll paint it.  No, no, we should come up with
something good."</P>
<P>"Mom!  Calm down.  You're going all ADD on us," Meagan
scolded.  "Besides, we've got a question before we pose again."</P>
<P>"Oh no!"  Debbie wailed.  "You're not going to pose if you
don't like my answer!"</P>
<P>"Maybe,"  Meagan admitted.  "But I want an honest answer. 
That painting where Peter and I were nude at a beach, did you doctor
it to have Peter ejaculating in his sleep?"</P>
<P>Debbie gasped, "How did you find out?  Did you take a key and
drive over to the storage area?"</P>
<P>"Mom!  We're not stalkers!  I don't know where your storage area
is, but I'll take that as a yes then."</P>
<P>Debbie nodded looking very nervous, "Does that mean you're going
to refuse to pose?"</P>
<P>"Hmm, I'll have to consult with my fellow model," Meagan
stated.  "You didn't try to hide the fact that you altered the
painting after we last saw it, but that was more panic than honesty."
 Peter and Meagan huddled and whispered while making gestures with
both hands.  Finally Meagan said out loud, "That sounds fair."</P>
<P>So, what's the verdict?"  Debbie asked.</P>
<P>"We'll pose, but you have to bring that paining back in here so
we can see the new, um… enhanced, version of the painting Mrs. D,"
Peter explained.</P>
<P>"Oh, that's a relief. You guys had me so worried. I promise I'll
fetch it after we get done posing."</P>
<P>"Actually, I've got another question." Peter stated.</P>
<P>Debbie's eyes bulged.  "Are you two trying to give me a heart
attack?"</P>
<P>"Well, no.  However, I can't figure out why you want to paint me
with a hard on pointed at your daughter so badly.  The reason we're
posing again is that both Meagan and I miss it, but we can't figure
out why this is so important to you."</P>
<P>"It's hard to put into words," Debbie protested.</P>
<P>"Well, go grab a thesaurus if you have to Mom, but now that
Peter brought that up, I want to hear the answer to this one too!"</P>
<P>"I don't even know where to start."</P>
<P>"Mother!  Just start at the beginning."</P>
<P>"Fine, well, in college, I had some female problems, and I had
to have an operation.  After that, I was never really interested in
guys.  But in my art classes, I loved painting nudes.  It was like I
could get a piece of something I wasn't normally interested in any
longer and transfer it to the canvas.  It wasn't the same as before,
but it was both exciting and satisfying nonetheless."</P>
<P>"So painting me with a boner for Meagan satisfies you somehow?"</P>
<P>"Oh, it sounds awful when you put it that way!"  Debbie
protested.</P>
<P>"Well, it sounds pretty fucking freaky!  How would you put it,
Mother?"</P>
<P>Debbie sighed and considered her words carefully.  "Painting
nudes allowed me to recapture, in a way, something I lost, but when
Peter got that huge erection, it was like finding something I never
knew I was missing.  It's not all about me missing out on something
though.  Painting in general is about doing something creative and
capturing some spark of life and preserving it for others to see. 
Painting the two of you just doesn't have a bit of a spark; it's like
a high voltage power line, or a thunderstorm or something.  On top of
that, I've never felt more creative than when I paint you and Peter."</P>
<P>Peter considered, "Hmm, I can see where you're coming from Mrs.
D." 
</P>
<P>Meagan was unconvinced.  "Really?  It still seems pretty fucking
weird to me.  I'll think about it more later,  though.  I'm starting
to get the itch to pose now."  Meagan started slipping out of her
robe and got off the stool she was sitting on.</P>
<P>"Oh thank goodness.  I thought you two were going to keep me
busy with questions all day!"  Debbie exclaimed.</P>
<P>Peter asked, "So how do you want us to pose?" while he too
slid off his robe.</P>
<P>Peter's erection was already in full force before Debbie could
answer.  "I've got an idea.  Peter, you look repentant and hold out
your arm."  Debbie bustled around the studio picking up unused
brushes and wrapping a cone of paper around them.  Handing them to
Peter, she said, "Hold these."</P>
<P>Meagan looked puzzled, and Debbie positioned her about 20 feet
from Peter.  "OK, you stand here, but lean toward Peter like you're
about to make a step toward him.  Look gentle and accepting."</P>
<P>"How am I supposed to do that?"  Meagan asked.</P>
<P>"I don't know, pretend you just had a big fight with me, but you
aren't mad at me any longer, except look at Peter."</P>
<P>"I think I can manage that, but what's up with Peter holding all
those paint brushes?"</P>
<P>"Oh yeah, I forgot to explain my good idea.  Pretend those are
flowers and that you like the looks of them."</P>
<P>Peter and Meagan shifted subtly as Debbie began to sketch. 
Normally she would have scolded them both, but she was too happy to
be painting again and simply sketched over previously drawn lines. 
The expressions of both models became more natural, while retaining
an obvious air of reconciliation.  Also, the way their bodies
shifted, the focus shifted away from the flowers and Meagan preparing
to move in Peter's direction.  Meagan once again was sticking her
chest out and proudly pointing her big tits in Peter's direction. 
The change in Peter's posture made it clear that the real gift he was
offering, and Meagan was accepting, was his huge erection instead of
the flowers.</P>
<P>Despite the positive mood during posing, Meagan was clearly
nervous of Peter's cock during breaks.  She made sure not to stand
too close to him until both were safely in their robes.  Debbie
offered to complete the painting the next day after about two hours
of posing.  They were all more cautious about taking frequent breaks
after the disastrous results of the last posing session, but Meagan
and Peter insisted on completing the painting that day.</P>
<P>Debbie wasn't sure if it was their refusal to stop or simply the
amount of time the two had spent posing, but the physical arousal of
both her models visibly increased after she had offered to let them
off the hook for the time being.  Peter's cock didn’t reach the
state it had been in after having his face inches from one of
Meagan's breasts for over an hour, and Debbie was glad of that.  She
wanted to make sure Peter increased his already formidable disciple
before she let him get that aroused in the studio again.  However,
she was sure Meagan's nipples had never been bigger or harder.</P>
<P>What Debbie didn't realize was that Meagan was concentrating
intently on her nipples.  She was thinking about what Peter had said
about her nipples getting bigger and bigger the more times she posed.
 She was purposely thinking of things that increased the pleasant
sensations coming from her nipples, and that was having a real effect
on her body.</P>
<P>Debbie finally said, "Well, I think I'm done.  Want to see the
result of the first painting back in the studio?"</P>
<P>"Ugh!  Not a second too soon!" Meagan grunted as she dashed
for the stairs.  She stumbled on the way up, and let out a near
orgasmic moan as she tried to regain her balance.  
</P>
<P>"That might not be a bad idea for me either Mrs. D.  I could use
some relief myself."  Peter added, "You can show us the painting
next time."  He too headed up the stairs, then stopped himself. 
"Fuck, I can't just go upstairs naked like Meagan did!  I've got to
get dressed again!"</P>
<P>Debbie giggled, "One time when Meagan got too excited, she
almost went out to check the mail without putting all her clothes on.
 I had to keep reminding her that she wasn't done dressing."</P>
<P>Really headed out the door this time, Peter paused on the stairs. 
"I just realized something Mrs. D.  Is there some story with
Meagan's father?"  Peter groaned suddenly and grabbed at his crotch
through his jeans.  "Never mind, you can answer that next time." 
With that, Peter bounded up the stairs three at a time and was gone.</P>
