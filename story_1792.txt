<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Two years and nine months had passed
since&nbsp; three young ex-public school girls had successfully completed
a bizarre and frequently chilly initiation test taking them on a journey
across their native land and bringing them face to face with all manner
of remarkable and frequently frightening people.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;It was August now and very
hot in Africa, especially for the work-hardened fair-skinned girl toiling
naked under the burning sun.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Harriet paused for a second in her
attack on the piece of rock, in order to wipe the sweat away.&nbsp; It
was getting into her eyes and she had no choice but to risk a punishment
for slacking.&nbsp; Happily for her, the&nbsp; guards had their attention
elsewhere - they knew&nbsp; by this time that she was a hard and tireless
worker and this pair had recently ceased to bother her&nbsp; much - so
she resumed her powerful, remorseless and skilful demolition of the rock,&nbsp;
her strong, scarred, gleaming back and sweating,&nbsp; well-muscled buttocks,&nbsp;
for a mercy unmolested.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">She poised her impressively strong
body,&nbsp; flexed her powerful biceps and shoulder muscles, and coming
up onto the toes of her hardened bare feet,&nbsp; prepared to wield those
final few well-aimed, powerful blows of the pickaxe which would finally
reduce the rock to fragments&nbsp; -&nbsp; a&nbsp; feat she had performed
so many times recently, that she found herself dreaming about it at nights.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">She had&nbsp; wanted the body of
a female Goliath, and this had been granted to&nbsp; her&nbsp; in full
measure -&nbsp; although not lately in the way she would have liked.&nbsp;
She could bear comparison to any&nbsp;&nbsp; man in the workforce - some
of them were magnificent specimens - and even in her present awful predicament
she gloried in her strong and muscular body and her amazing stamina.&nbsp;
She recalled how many times before her capture she had had to buy new clothes
to fit her increasingly muscular body.&nbsp; No worries on that score since
she had been kidnapped and forced to walk naked carrying all manner of
heavy equipment through the forests and savannahs, finally ending up in
this lair helping to build the base for the final battle.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Another obstacle in the path of
the runway construction project had been cleared and she shovelled up the
fragments and wheeled them away to be used as spoil later.&nbsp; There
were plenty more rocks to remove and plenty more irregularities to be evened
out and depressions to be filled in and plenty more pushing of the heavy
roller&nbsp; and laying of concrete before the long runway would be ready.&nbsp;
And what then?&nbsp; They would hardly need her services when automatic&nbsp;
rollers and mechanised excavating machinery had been flown in.&nbsp; The
other labourers&nbsp; were all volunteers, albeit rather reluctant ones,
and they would in all probability go back to their villages, but the despised
white prisoner would very likely be surplus to requirements - a useless
mouth to feed.&nbsp; She wondered how long it would be before this base
had been turned into some sort of springboard for a final assault on the
capital&nbsp; and the likely death of all those good friends in high government
positions that she she had made in those&nbsp; productive and happy months
before her capture.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">For the hundredth time in the course
of this long day she reflected that this was the second anniversary of
her arrival in Africa and to this strife-torn country.&nbsp; It was also
the end of a year as the prisoner of the Marxist rebels who had so much
of the land in their merciless grip.&nbsp; She had little hope of rescue
- all her friends thought she was dead - and none of escape.&nbsp; All
her efforts to get away had been miserable failures and she had no wish
to suffer&nbsp; further uncomfortable retribution.&nbsp; Indeed she had
been told that just one more attempt to leave would be her last act in
this world and she had a shrewd idea that her exit from&nbsp; life would
not be made easy.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">"To think I once had some sympathy
for these horrible people" she mutterd under her breath as she remembered
the juvenile Communist sympathies which she had once inflicted on friend
and family alike.&nbsp; It pained and shamed her to think that her good
work in her first year for a VSO project had been utterly negated by the&nbsp;
contribution she was being forced into&nbsp; now in her second twelvemonth,
helping these evil butchers to enslave and destroy a country and people
she had come to love, if not admire.&nbsp;&nbsp; She ought to refuse to
do any more for them and damn the consequences&nbsp; - she knew one brave
friend who would long ago have done just that - and now that all hope of
escape or rescue seemed gone, she resolved either to make one more escape
attempt or simply refuse to do any more work for these monsters.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">"One more day of this, and if nothing
shows up (which it won't) I'll bring it to an end one way or another.&nbsp;
Who wants to go on living anyway if this is all life has to offer?"&nbsp;
Such&nbsp; was her desparing thought.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">One of the other workers came up
to her with a cup of water which she eagerly gulped down.&nbsp; It was
her first drink for four hours -&nbsp; they had denied her the&nbsp; last
two-hourly drink, allegedly for not working hard enough - as if!&nbsp;
She did more than any two of these other useless people put together.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;She was European and hated
by her fanatic captors&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; a subhuman member of a former
colonial ruling caste fit only to be used as a beast of burden and regularly
whipped as a way of making her work even harder.&nbsp; At least that meant
she had no fear of being raped, as any contact with her was deemed to be
defiling to these glorious fighters for freedom.&nbsp; Not that she didn't&nbsp;
frequently get plenty of lusting glances from her captors. But discipline
was so vicious and so cruelly enforced by higher command,&nbsp; that nobody
dared touch her except to slap her around&nbsp; from time to time - and
that she could easily handle.&nbsp; If discipline ever did break down,
she dreaded to think what might happen to her at the hands of some of these
men - although it would take three of them at least to overpower her, if
they ever did decide on anything.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">The second four hour shift was over
and the grateful workers went off for four hours rest and a meal.&nbsp;
Harriet carried on without pausing.&nbsp; A new pair of guards ambled on
to the site and one of them longingly eyed her supple and inviting buttocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This tiresome bastard took a particular delight in lambasting her bottom
and she had not missed his absence at all over the few days.&nbsp; The
last time she had been under his care she had had to lie on her front and
side at night,&nbsp; she had been so sore.&nbsp; Despite this she had far
less fear of him than some of the others&nbsp; - she had a notion that
he was not really such a bad guy, in spite of his rather infantile obsession
with her butt. And a slap on the bottom was nowhere near as bad as what
they regularly did to her back with those rhinocerous hide whips whose
lashing she would most likely feel again in a few days.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Two more shifts to go and she would
eat for the first time since sunrise and then sleep like one of the dead
in her wire mesh open-to-the-elements cage.&nbsp; She was secretly proud
of her ability to work sixteen hours a day seven days a week non -stop
except for a few seconds now and again to down a draught of water.&nbsp;
(She had willingly worked almost as hard and long as a volunteer worker).</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">They would curse her if she took
too long over her sheduled drink and deny her the next one, so that the
thirst threatened to drive her mad as the sweat continued to pour from
her toiling body, a body which was never suffered to slacken its efforts
for a second.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Two more four hour shifts and if
she eased up they had plenty of ways of making her sorry.&nbsp; Once, very
early in her captivity they had staked her out spreadeagled in the sun
for three days with nothing to eat in all that time.&nbsp; She had been
given a cup of water at sunset.&nbsp; There&nbsp; had been some sort of
holiday decreed&nbsp; for the rebels and that had been their way of making
sure she was no trouble whilst they celebrated and feasted.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">From the earliest days in their
clutches she had been&nbsp; horribly shocked at the way they treated those&nbsp;
fellow countrymen who refused to join them.&nbsp; She understood their
hostility to her as a hated symbol of colonialism, but not their terrible&nbsp;
their hatred to&nbsp; their own people if they failed to share their views.&nbsp;
How she missed tolerant, easy going England where such passions were almost
unknown!&nbsp; If she ever by some miracle got back home, she vowed that
she would never again leave it - not as long as she lived.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;In the last two years Harriet
had grown up a lot and seen things that still gave her nightmares.&nbsp;
She remembered Bernard who had made such exciting love to her, but ultimately
been bored by the juvenile and naive schoolgirl she had been at the time.&nbsp;
He would think differently about her now, she thought with pride.&nbsp;
She had experienced&nbsp; things which would bear comparison with his most
stomach churning and blood curdling tales.&nbsp; He might be a hard man
but she was at least as hard as he&nbsp; by this time - probably a great
deal harder!&nbsp;&nbsp; Tough or not - she would still shed a tear or
two whenever she thought about him.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">She frequently wept copiously at
night when she thought about Gwen and Jessica, especially Gwendoline, that
wild, eccentric lovely girl.&nbsp; Those two meant more to her than her
own parents, the affable and generous but distant&nbsp; Marquess and her&nbsp;
scatter-brained mother.&nbsp; As for her twin brothers who were twenty
years her senior, she had never really known them , or wanted to.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">As she had feared,&nbsp; the Guard's
obsession with her pneumatic buttocks soon caused him to start turning
them red , grinning half-wittedly as he did so,&nbsp; and she half decided
to down tools there and then,&nbsp; until he was called away by one of
the higher-ups and did not return to duty for the rest of the day.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">At the end of another gruelling
day under a burning sun which still caused her pale skin much discomfort,&nbsp;
they threw her, as usual,&nbsp; into her cage and locked her in with food,
drink and that disgusting bucket in the corner, which she would have to
empty in the morning.&nbsp; She stretched out on the earthen floor, trying
not to think of snakes and scorpions,&nbsp; and reviewed all&nbsp; that
had happened to her since the end of that journey of initiation all those
months ago.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">At first she had slipped back into
her former lifestyle, but her life of ease had come to a sudden end when
she received that phone call from Gwen.</font></b><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">to be continued.</font></b>
