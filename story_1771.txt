<p>Katie O' Brien rolled off of Angela and lay on her back beside her,
brushing her lips against her friend's soft warm hip and tickling her lovely
black pubic bush with her fingers. (What HAVE they been up to?)
<p>Angie lay on her back, relieved in a way that her companion's weight
was no longer on top of her, and tenderly kissed Katie's butterfly tattoo
and ran her fingers through Katies copper coloured bush..
<p>"Why did you let me stand up just at that end of that lovely fantastic
long fight?"
<p>"I didn't want to totally humiliate you, of course.&nbsp; I wanted you
on your feet to take the final kick, standing up to it like the good brave
girl you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mind you, you were pretty well a goner by then.&nbsp;
It only needed a tap, and I didn't kick you that hard - I didn't need to"
<p>&nbsp;She got up and shifted her position so as to be able to kiss that
sweet mouth.
<p>"You kicked me plenty&nbsp; hard enough Katie." drawing briefly away
from the kiss " I was almost hoping you were going to let me off any more
punishment, but I'm glad you didn't.&nbsp; We can't have each other going
soft on each other or with anyone else!&nbsp; Not with all the trouble
we're in with those horrible people. Something tells me we're going to
need all the toughness we've got before too much longer."
<p>And so their mouths melted together again and did not part for a very
long time.
<p>Finally they surfaced and paused to get their breath back before resuming
these lovely activities.
<p>"Kate old thing, you nearly slipped up with that circle you drew.&nbsp;
If it&nbsp; had been an inch or two less in diameter, I would have had
you."
<p>"I know, angel, I made a bad mistake there"
<p>"Katie, sweetheart?"
<p>"Angie, darling?"
<p>"Next time we fight each other on the sand, we toss a coin to decide
who draws the circle"
<p>"Good idea, Angie - but you're still going down again"
<p>"Bollocks"
<p>"Let's finish off this beautiful kiss and go out for a walk on the beach"
<p>The weather had improved and the wind had swung to the west, bringing
heavy rain, but higher temperatures.&nbsp; The daring pair would have stripped
off completely for the walk&nbsp; but for the fact&nbsp; that they already
were stripped off and had been in this by now familiar and welcome condtition
since leaving London a few hours earlier at five in the morning.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>"Let's have a race, you can run for miles along the sand"
<p>And so the couple raced along the shoreline, their feet slapping into
the shallow water and throwing up spray. The rain poured incessantly on
to their nude bodies&nbsp; and their hair was soon plastered and soaking.
It must have been an hour, before they stopped and sank on to the sand
together.
<p>"Gosh, Katie, I have such fun with you.&nbsp; Time for a swim!"
<p>The water was colder than any thing they had experienced and after twenty
minutes, Katie yelled out "Let's get back Angie"
<p>"Chicken!&nbsp; I'm staying in a lot longer yet!"
<p>"So am I , then"
<p>But it was only a couple more minutes before, by mutual consent, they
emerged shivering from head to toe and blue with cold.
<p>Mad as ever, they continued running away from the cottage for&nbsp;
another hour and then turned for home. Tired of running and Angie anxious
to give her sore and battered breasts a rest from all the painful bouncing,
they walked arm in arm and chatted.
<p>"I'll be thinking of moving house when all this is over, said Katie.&nbsp;
"I made up my mind months ago I was going to move to Hampstead, but I keep
procrastinating.&nbsp; I'll have to find something smaller, it's so expensive
there"
<p>They walked on for a few minutes in silence and Angie stopped and embraced
Katie, kissing her long and hard.
<p>"We'll move there together, my darling. I think we now by now we're
going to be together for a long time - maybe for keeps.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can
sell my place and we'll be able to buy a lovely house in Hampstead and
live happily ever after.&nbsp; We''ll start househunting on Monday. I'll
take the day off and so will you."
<p>"Angie, darling Angie - aren't we going to be so happy"
<p>And the two started trying to do cartwheels on the rain soaked beach
not making a very elegant job of it, and ran the rest of the way laughing
happily together.
<p>Until they stopped.&nbsp; A strange car was parked near the cottage
and Katie recognised all four people who were emerging from it.
<p>"Quick, behind the sand dunes before they see us.&nbsp; SHIT, Angie
whatever are we going to do.&nbsp; We can't stay out here for long, we'll
freeze!
