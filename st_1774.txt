DESERT</span></font><br>
<font size="+2"><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Chapter One </span><br
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Two
Half-Dressed Girls in the Desert </span></font><br>
<big><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Clarissa
and Megan had been close friends all the time they were at school.
Megan was much taller and bigger than Clarissa. Clarissa, at eighteen,
was five foot four and slight, with fair hair, blue eyes a pert little
nose and slight, feminine chin.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Megan
was darker haired, six inches taller and with features that were almost
masculine in their strength. She had excelled at all sports and been
the head girl in the final year. In all their time together it had been
Megan who had looked out for Clarissa and made sure none of the other
girls picked on her or bullied her.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">The
close relationship was about to be sundered now that they had left
school. Clarissa was to go to Cambridge and Megan&nbsp; was to train
for the police. Megan&#8217;s parents were disappointed that their daughter
had not set her sights higher, but Megan was adamant. So Clarissa would
no doubt go on, in time, to become a judge&nbsp; after qualifying as a
barrister and Megan might find herself giving evidence in a trial
presided over by her friend - or so they both joked!</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">In
March, before they embarked on their separate careers the two set off
on a tour of North America. Megan promised Clarissa&#8217;s parents that she
would look after her as she had always done up until now.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">All went
much as planned until they decided to drive across from East to West,
ending up in Mexico, where Clarissa had a distant relative. It was
early May and they were somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Already the
temperatures were soaring in this corner of the desert and the couple
were appropriately dressed, with Megan in a short top and even shorter
shorts and Clarissa in a fetching and tiny bikini. Megan was thinking
how pretty Clarissa was looking these days, with her rich deep
suntan,&nbsp; when the truck hit an obstruction on the dirt road and
lurched into a pothole, tipping half over.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Golly,
Megan! That was a pretty crap bit of driving!&#8221; said Clarissa. &#8220;I hope
you don&#8217;t drive squad cars like that when you&#8216;re a lady cop!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Just
help me get this thing upright, Clarrie!&#8221; said Megan, sweating and
panting as she tried to get the heavy vehicle back on four wheels
again. It was midday and the temperature was in the hundreds already.
Neither wished to be stuck here for any longer than they had to. Megan
was almost succeeding&nbsp; in righting the truck when the sound of a
siren became audible. A cloud of dust in the distance materialised into
a police car.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">When it
arrived two women officers got out and came to look at the damaged
truck. They took in the two girls&#8217; semi-nudity with what Clarissa
uneasily recognised&nbsp; to be a disapproving look. Megan was too
busy&nbsp; dabbing at her body to get rid of the sweat and grease to
notice this puritanical reaction, and she was hardly one for picking up
on nuances in any case. Clarissa lowered one hand to cover her pierced
and bejewelled navel, the sight of which was clearly not pleasing to
either of these rescuers. Clarissa was barefoot, but Megan, who had
been driving, wore a pair of open-toed sandals. Clarissa found herself
wishing that her thong bikini bottom covered more than precisely nought
percent of her backside! These ladies were looking at her exposed
cheeks with unconcealed horror. But when they spoke it was in a
friendly enough tone.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;We&#8217;ll
take you to the nearest town and you can arrange to have your vehicle
towed away and repaired.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">This
seemed reasonable and both girls took their minimal amount of luggage
out of their car and got into the back of the police car. Clarissa
rummaged around for something to cover herself more respectably and
found a cotton dress which she slipped on, feeling better able to
withstand the world&#8217;s gaze. Megan looked a bit worried.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Funny
thing, Clarissa! There are no badges on either of these cops and the
car&nbsp; doesn&#8217;t look right, somehow. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d be showing
some sign as to which state&nbsp; or jurisdiction we were in. But they
just&nbsp; look vaguely like cops, but I suppose they do things
differently here!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;I
suppose we didn&#8217;t cross a border or anything?&#8221; said Clarissa. &#8220;I agree,
these two don&#8217;t look right, but they&#8217;d hardly be driving around like
that if they weren&#8217;t genuine. The way they were looking at me was very
worrying! I got the idea they regard us both as loose women and a
threat to public morals! The sooner we are somewhere half-way civilised
the better!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;And we
don&#8217;t seem to be going anywhere in the direction of any town I know of&#8221;
said Megan. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">As she
spoke, the car turned a bend in the road and in front of them, about
five miles away in the flat shimmering desert was a set of buildings
surrounded by a high wall. It looked dilapidated and deserted, but as
they got nearer they could see that there were four towers at each
corner of the quadrilateral enclosure and all four were manned.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Looks
like some kind of fort, maybe built by the Spanish.&#8221; whispered
Clarissa. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">The car
was forced to drive slowly because of the appalling terrain and it took
twenty minutes before they reached the building. A gate was opened and
they drove inside.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">The
driver and her companion got out and opened the rear door.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Come
this way, please!&#8221; one of them said in a pleasant enough voice. The
girls followed the two officers across a large compound to the main
building and were shown into an office.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Wait
here and when your vehicle has been retrieved we will let you know. You
can stay here overnight if it takes time to repair it.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Then the
officers left. Megan went over to the window and saw them drive away.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a
funny sort of place, this! It seems deserted, but there are people on
each of those towers. It&#8217;s almost like a Stalag, except there are no
prisoners!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Maybe
they are all out working in the heat!&#8221; joked Clarissa, who had come to
stand next to her friend. &#8220;I&#8217;m thirsty! Let&#8217;s see if we can find some
water.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">But when
they tried to open the door, they found that it was locked. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Odd.
Well - there are no bars to the windows!&#8221; said Megan. Soon the pair
were out in the compound, a large area of dried mud.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;It must
get very muddy when it rains - if it ever does rain around here!&#8221; said
Clarissa. &#8220;I wonder what goes on around in this place? Oh, here comes
someone!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">The
someone in question was actually three people, all female and all
uniformed. All were armed and all looked anything but friendly.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;What
are you two doing outside?&#8221; asked the leading lady.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;We got
locked in somehow and climbed through the window. It&#8217;s hot and we&#8217;re
thirsty. Our car broke down and a couple of police dropped us here and
said we could wait until someone towed it away and got it fixed.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Get
back inside! As for water - that is rationed. You&#8217;ll get some later
when the others return.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;What
others?&#8221; asked Clarissa.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;The
other prisoners. You are prisoners, now. Drugs were found in your car
and you have been sentenced to thirty years hard labour. Get back
inside at once.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;How can
we be sentenced without even being charged!&#8221; asked an irate Megan. &#8220; Is
this some sort of joke? Because I&#8217;m not laughing. I demand we be
allowed to use a phone.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;There
is no phone here. Not for the use of prisoners. Go back inside!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">This
instruction was accompanied by a threatening gesture with the rifle the
woman was holding. When this had no effect, Megan was struck on the
face, making her mouth bleed. Reluctantly the pair went back into the
building. This time they were not shown into the office but marched
along a long corridor and into a dark room with barred windows high up
on the walls so it was impossible to see out.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;I still
think this is some kind of practical joke!&#8221; said Megan, although her
bruised face made her doubt this explanation inwardly. But she had to
try and cheer Clarissa up, because the smaller girl looked to be near
hysterical. She put an arm around her and felt her trembling gradually
die down. Then she replied.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;It&#8217;s no
joke, Megan. Not the way that bitch hit you! What if we&#8217;ve strayed into
an area run by some kind of religious sect? It might be quite easy to
take over a small community and impose a lot of mad laws. The central
government probably leaves them alone, not knowing just how insane they
are. We must have struck them as deserving of locking up. Maybe we were
not modestly enough dressed, (especially me!) or maybe they just felt
like picking on two strangers who won&#8217;t be missed for months and can
never be traced. We&#8217;ve got to get away from here, Megan. Because we
won&#8217;t get any help from others. We&#8217;re on our own!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Well,
we aren&#8217;t going anywhere just yet!&#8221; said Megan who had just tried the
door, which refused to budge a millimetre. &#8220;That door was built to
withstand a tank!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">They had
been there for three hours when the door opened and one of the
uniformed women came in. She placed a tray containing food and water on
the floor and left. Both girls tried to question her about what was
going on, but she ignored them. They shared the meal and resumed
waiting.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Two
hours after this the door again opened and two guards came in. One of
them carried a pair of garments over her arm.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Get
undressed, both of you. Then put these on. It&#8217;s all you get to wear
while you&#8217;re here, so look after it!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Megan
looked as if she were going to protest, but another blow to her face
convinced her to obey. Both girls took off all their clothes, except
Megan&#8217;s shoes, since footwear was not part of the dress they had been
issued with.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Shoes
too! Off with everything!&#8221; barked out the guard. So Megan joined
Clarissa in being barefoot.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">So Megan
and Clarissa put on the grey briefs and blue cotton dresses which
buttoned up down the front and came half way down Megan&#8217;s thighs and
almost to Clarissa&#8217;s knees. Their own clothes were taken away and the
pair left alone again - but not for long this time.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;I hope
you get something to put on your feet, Megan! It&#8217;s so hot you&#8217;ll be
burnt out in the open. Even I get a bit uncomfortable and I&#8217;m more used
to it than you are. I guess the other prisoners are all out somewhere
breaking rocks or whatever it is they have in store for us. We won&#8217;t
get far on foot either, judging from what we&#8217;ve seen of the terrain.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;I guess
that&#8217;s the idea, Clarrie! No shoes means we&#8217;ll never get far on foot.
And any transport will be well guarded - but stealing a vehicle is our
only hope.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;They
can&#8217;t get away with this for ever, Megan! One day the authorities will
get wise to this and it won&#8217;t be us behind bars, but the people running
this place!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;But how
long will that take? I suppose we&#8217;ll know more when we get to talk to
some of the others.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">They had
only minutes to wait before they were ordered out onto the parade
ground to be lined up for inspection. The other women were still being
unloaded from the transport. They were a varied looking bunch, ranging
from several girls little or no older than Megan and Clarissa to others
who looked to be in their sixties, although Clarissa guessed they were
much younger.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Most&nbsp;
wore the same gear as the two girls, but quite a few were naked. And a
couple only wore briefs. Many of the prison dresses were torn and in
some cases the buttons had clearly been lost, as the women concerned
had no means of hiding their breasts from the sun and the stares of the
guards.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;I
suppose some of them just had their clothes wear off them and they
won&#8217;t get any more issued. Let&#8217;s hope we won&#8217;t be around long enough
for that to happen to us!&#8221; said Clarissa in a whisper, scarcely moving
her lips. She might have not moved her lips but both of them were
shifting from one foot to the other. The ground was incredibly hot and
even Clarissa&#8217;s&nbsp; soles were getting blistered. One of the guards
saw this and yelled at them to keep still. They obeyed and the agony
soon became almost unendurable.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Once all
the women had been lined up the roll was called, and both newcomers&#8217;
names were included. Then they were all left to their own devices. A
group of women came and gathered around the two friends.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Welcome
to Hell, girls!&#8221; said a large woman, as tall as&nbsp; Megan . &#8220;Hell,
first because of the guards who&#8217;ll work you to death and hell from the
inmates, if you aren&#8217;t careful! But this little treasure will be OK! I
like sweet little things like you, honey!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Keep
your hands of my friend!&#8221; said Megan, putting herself between her
smaller friend and the woman. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have me to deal with if you touch
her.&#8221;</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;And
me!&#8221; said Clarissa. &#8220;I won&#8217;t take anything lying down! Just lay off us!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Keep
out of it&#8221; said a voice behind Clarissa. A hand was laid on her
shoulder. &#8220;Let your friend take care of herself - if she can!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Clarissa
looked round and another big woman was behind her. This one looked less
threatening than the one who was now squaring up to Megan, clearly with
a view to beating her up. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Megan
can deal with that cow! Just watch!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Megan
indeed knew how to take care of herself. The big woman hit out at her
and found herself on the ground, blinking dazedly.&nbsp; She looked at
the others of her group and they all made for Megan who was soon
fighting off four women at once. This was too much, even for the
skilled Megan who had excelled at martial arts,&nbsp; and she was soon
being pummelled by three angry women whilst being firmly held by two
others. Then the guards came running up and Megan was left standing as
her attackers backed away. She had a cut lip and bruised cheek but was
otherwise none the worse for her little fight.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Who
started this?&#8221; asked the chief warder.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;She
did.&#8221; answered the big girl who had started all the trouble. &#8220;I wanted
her friend as my toy and she objected.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Is this
true! Did you attack this inmate!&#8221; screamed the guard, whose rifle butt
had&nbsp; already crashed twice into Megan&#8217;s face.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Yes,
But she was&#8230;.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Megan
got no further as she was sent sprawling by a swinging, clubbing blow
from the warder&#8217;s rifle. She struggled to her feet, her face streaming
with blood and her nose obviously badly broken. The terrified Clarissa
was almost sick at the sight. The pressure on her shoulder was
increased and the woman behind her whispered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry! They won&#8217;t
kill her. But she won&#8217;t be looking after you for a while. Luckily, I
will!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;As long
I as I become your toy, I suppose! No thanks!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;I&#8217;d
like you as my lover. I&#8217;ll be honest about that. But there&#8217;s no
compulsion! I&#8217;ll look after you until your mate is able to again - and
that will not be for a very long time!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Why?
What&#8217;s going to happen to her?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Plenty!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Plenty
of bad things?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Very
bad things! I hope she&#8217;s strong. She&#8217;ll need to be!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;And
you&#8217;ll look after me? Why will you?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;I like
you. And you remind me of someone! Don&#8217;t keep looking at her! It won&#8217;t
help either of you! You can&#8217;t help her now. I wish I could take you
away from this back to the cells. But they&#8217;ll make us watch.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;What
will they do to her?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Beat
her, humiliate her. Make her wish she was dead. It isn&#8217;t going to be
pretty. But they won&#8217;t kill her. They never do. And all this was so
unnecessary! I saw what was happening and was coming to sort it out
when your friend got in first. She&#8216;s a good girl, alright, but she&#8216;ll
wish she&#8216;d thought first in the weeks ahead!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Clarissa&#8217;s
mysterious benefactor became silent, as did the rest of the chattering
women, as another woman, whom Clarissa was later to know as Warden
Kane, came marching across.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;What
goes on here?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;This
new inmate assaulted Debbie, Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Once
again Megan was asked if this were true, once again she tried to
explain and once more she was clubbed brutally to the ground. This time
she got up very slowly and Clarissa saw that her friend and protector
was now very frightened indeed.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Just
answer either yes or no!&#8221; screamed the Warden. &#8220;Did you start a fight
with this inmate?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">Once
again Megan was sent to the floor, her face becoming bloodier each time
the rifle butt struck it. A horrified Clarissa hardly recognised her
friend by this time, but the steady pressure on her shoulder warned her
not to say anything. There was nothing she could do for Megan except
pray.</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;On your
feet! You aren&#8217;t that badly hurt - yet!&#8221; ordered the Warden. And Megan
obeyed.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;You
address me as Ma&#8217;am! Once more - did you attack this inmate?&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">&#8220;Yes,
Ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: times new roman;">The
warden turned to the senior guard. She ordered, &#8220;Deal with her!&#8221; and
then walked away.</span></big><br
