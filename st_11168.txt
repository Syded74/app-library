Final Fantasy Seven: TFLN Cues

(Texts from Last Night)

Did I mention that this is completely random time line and I will be jumping around and they will not be in any particular order? I write as I get amused from the various text and find and they are linking – slightly – together.

Rating: T… no M… because of language? Just play it safe!

Characters: Cloud and Reno
POV: Reno

Beep

*beep-beep*

~oh man, my head hurts~

His head was pounding from the obvious overindulgence of his favourite drink - vodka. It was a new flavour and he wanted to make sure that he liked it.

Reno tried to roll over and it seemed that the room decided to do it for him. He groaned loudly and it hurt his ears to hear himself.

*beep-beep*

He remembered Tifa offering the new flavour – grape- and mixing it with some ginger ale. He also remembered that it tasted wonderful and he had more than his normal limits to what he could drink.

*beep-beep*

~how did I get home?~

That was a good question. He remembered Rude leaving him behind around midnight and Cloud coming in…

~oh yeah~

He reached up and touched his face to make sure that there weren't any cuts or broken parts. He was grateful that he still had all his teeth.

*beep-beep*

~bonus~

He did remember a fist colliding with his stomach though and he ran his hand over his bruised belly. He had hit him hard.

*beep-beep*

He was pretty sure that he deserved it though. He remembered vividly grabbing Cloud's leather bound ass and making a comment about purple silk.

*beep-beep*

~where the fuck is my phone?

He cautiously moved his head and looked at his long end table and saw that it was empty. The cord for the charger was there, but his phone was not attached.

*beep-beep*

It was on his dresser… across the room.

*beep-beep*

Two beeps, two messages.

*beep-beep*

He usually disabled his phone when he went to bed, so that he could sleep, and he so wanted to go back to sleep. His head and his stomach hurt on so many levels.

~I hoped I puked on Cloud~

*beep-beep*

But he wouldn't be able to sleep until he shut off the damn phone and that meant that he had to walk across the room.

*beep-beep*

"Damn phone," he muttered and he slowly and painfully sat up in his bed, then held his head as he walked. His stomach protested the movement. He wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or if it was the fist that had done it.

~doesn't matter~

He needed to shut the damn thing off so he could get to sleep.

*beep-beep*

He finally reached the phone and saw that there were indeed two messages and both were from Cloud. Even in his hangover state of nausea and pain, he was curious. Cloud had never phoned or texted him before.

I hope that you have to get out of bed and walk across the room to check out this text message

And the second message.

Perv

Yeah. He really pissed off Cloud.

~I think it has something to do with asking if he still had that dress~

I hope that you have to get out of bed and walk across the room to check out this text message… the whole inspirational text. I added the perv part.

Review/Comments are inspirational, just remember that.
