From the pen of Bertram W. Wooster: In which Bertie comes to realize the gravity of his situation.

Chapter 5: Games

As soon as the door to the flat was shut, leaving us in the hallway on one side and Jeeves and the rest on the other, Roberson relaxed his grip on me and I was able draw a full breath for the first time in what felt like an age. His gun, however, was still a fearfully tactile presence against my ribs.

"Walk forward, slowly. If you try to run or call for help I shall shoot you."

"Is this really necessary? The whatsits with the gun, that is."

"I'm afraid it is, Mr. Wooster," he said, and the bally odd thing was that he almost did sound regretful. Then again, when I greeted him in my flat, he sounded genuinely friendly, too, and that didn't last five minutes before he started shooting people. Despite what Aunt Agatha and others may say, I am capable of learning from my mistakes, and I decided that whatever this Roberson chap said, no matter how earnest he might seem, I should take it with an ocean of salt, salt enough to rival the Great Salt Flats in saltiness.

With his gun hidden in his coat pocket, just like a Chicago gangster, he prodded me outside to a waiting cab. I considered trying to elicit the cabbie's help, babble out my tale of woe and hope that he was the sort of good egg who'd help his fellow man, but I recalled Roberson's threats re. shooting and decided it wasn't worth the risk.

We rode towards the river and ended our journey somewhere near the East End, or so it seemed to me from what little I could make out in the darkness. When we arrived at our destination, which was a shoddy-looking structure with splintering boards and peeling paint, Roberson shuffled me out of the cab and inside.

The interior had as little to recommend to it as the exterior. It was dark, on account of there being no electric lamps, only old-fashioned gas. The dim light was all for the better, since the combination of colours with which the owner had chosen to decorate-ruby red curtains and violet wallpaper-would have made Jeeves weep had he been there. A gaggle of ladies...well...females, at any rate, lolled about the foyer. One of these, a middle-aged woman, rose and sauntered in our direction. She was tall and thin, with black hair and a long face like a basset hound in makeup.

"Marcus, love, I thought you was going to be here hours ago," she said. She gave me the once-over. " 'ere's a pretty lad you've brought with you. Who is he?"

"He's no one of consequence, my dear."

I took affront at such dismissive words. "I say, I'm of great consequence to me!"

"Ooo, he talks even more posh than you do," the woman said with glee.

Roberson's grip on my arm squeezed painfully. "Leave it be, Ettie. He won't be with us for very long."

"Got something all planned out?"

Roberson smiled. "Of course. Not exactly as I'd originally intended, but it will do."

"Don't go getting too inventive now. We have a deal, and I don't want no surprises coming down on me."

"Don't fuss so." Roberson planted a kiss on her forehead. "I know what I'm doing. Did you prepare my rooms?"

"All aired out and fresh linen just like you asked."

"Thank you, my dear." Roberson tugged at my arm and we made our way up a rickety old staircase and into a suite of rooms. It was like entering an entirely different building. Well, almost. There was nothing one could do about the smell of mould, but olfactory considerations aside, this room could have been transplanted straight out of one of the nicer country cottages. The furniture was solid oak oiled to a golden shine, the oriental rug bright, and the decor tasteful if old-fashioned.

I was manoeuvred to a chair and, with a wordless wave of the gun, ordered to sit. One doesn't like to argue with a gun, so I obeyed post-haste. Roberson retrieved a coil of rope and secured my arms to those of the chair. I winced as he pulled it taut, the rope biting into my limbs and my fingers tingling. He seemed quite casual about the whole thing, as if this were something he did often and was therefore hardly worth his notice, like an old fisherman tying off a net. He chatted offhandedly as he worked.

"Ettie's a good girl. If you pay her." He grinned. "But she's quite willing to be a naughty girl if you pay her well."

I looked around, wondering to whom he was speaking. There didn't seem to be anyone else in the room, so using a bit of the old Wooster logic I determined that he was speaking to me. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to reply or not. I'd never learned the conversational etiquette for kidnapping before, although I don't doubt that there's a book for it, given that there's an etiquette book for every other occasion. I settled the debate on whether to reply or not to reply with an ingenious compromise. I made a non-verbal noise of interest, something like, "hum" or "huh," which I could pass off as a tickle in my throat if it turned out to be the incorrect response. It seemed to do the trick, for Roberson continued.

"We go back a long way, Ettie and I." Satisfied with the trussed up state of yours truly, he fetched himself a drink from the sidebar.

I looked on in longing. After the rummy day I'd had, a drink would have been nectar from heaven. "I don't suppose you'd consider offering me one?" I asked.

"Of course! Where are my manners?" He laughed and poured a second glass. Returning to me, he held the glass out to me. I reached to accept-or, I would have reached, had my arms not been inconveniently bound. I tugged again at the bindings, hoping that perhaps they'd be right nice chaps and let Bertram Wooster bally well have his much needed drink. Alas, they were disobliging. "Oh my, well, that is a problem, isn't it." He laughed again and took the drink away, my yearning gaze following the amber liquid as it drew farther and farther from me, like a man stranded on a desert island watching a ship, his one hope at rescue, sailing into the distance beyond the horizon.

If Jeeves were here he'd hold the glass to my lips so that even immobilized, I'd not have to go without. Of course, if Jeeves were here, he'd probably find a way to save me so I'd not have to be immobilized and he'd not have to hold said glass to said lips, although I'd not object if he did anyway. I tried to imagine Jeeves offering me a drink in such a way, one hand behind my head, just at the base of my skull, the other carefully lifting the glass to my mouth, tilting slowly so I'd not spill a drop. The fancy was impossible to hold on to; like water cupped in one's bare hands, it slipped away. Jeeves was too prim and proper, too aloof to do such an intimate thing. Perhaps if I were sick, yes, if I were sick he might do it, although under those circumstances he would more likely be spoon feeding me soup than pouring whisky down my throat. There was no Jeeves around to help me, though, just Roberson, who was disinclined to do me any favours. Instead, he tossed back his drink and mine, and set the two glasses down on a brown-wrapped parcel.

"I say, is that my parcel?" I craned my neck to get a better view. "It is! Well, that's a bit of good news. I feared it was lost forever."

"Important, is it?"

"Oh yes, very," I assured him. "I was utterly distraught when I thought it was gone."

He raised his brows and gazed at the parcel more closely. "Well, if it's important," he said, moving the glasses away and picking at the knot in the twine. "We had best make sure it's intact."

I could have kicked myself for giving away any information; I could have, that is, if I weren't tied down to a chair. I tried to salvage the situation. "That's not necessary. It's not really important. I mean, it is, but only in a personal manner." Realizing how the blackmailer might interpret this I hastened to add, "But not like Dr. Watson's documents, not personal as in private, just personal as in personal, not public. Well, they will be public eventually, at least that's the intent, but the public isn't terribly concerned about it and wouldn't give one whit if it vanished or was pinned to the church door for all to see. So you see it's not really anything so important that you have to open it."

As I finished speaking, Roberson undid the knot and tore off the wrapping. He sat down in a wing-backed chair and peered at the first page. "A novel?" He laughed. "This is your very important document?"

"I did clarify that it's just a trifle," I pointed out, feeling unaccountably perturbed by Roberson reading my novel before my very eyes. It was bad enough to watch Jeeves read my work, my stomach twisting itself up like those balloon animals as I examine every twitch of his face to ascertain his opinion. Jeeves, at least, lets me down gently when it's rubbish. I shuddered to think how a man who had no compunction about shooting actual people might treat a poor, innocent text. I scrunched my eyes shut and waited for the worst.

A few moments later, Roberson began to chuckle. Pages rustled and now and then another chortle would bubble up. I opened my eyes.

"This," he tapped the manuscript, "this is quite droll. The nitwit narrator is very amusing."

"Nitwit?" I huffed.

"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought he was supposed to be a caricature." Roberson returned to the book while I brooded.

Some minutes later, Roberson spoke again. "This Jeeves of yours is a clever chap, isn't he? That's useful to know."

Hearing Roberson mention Jeeves's name made my insides squirm. It couldn't have been more than an hour since I'd left his presence, but I missed him terribly nonetheless. I couldn't stop thinking about him, and hearing his name spoken aloud didn't help push him from my mind. I wished more than anything that he'd come shimmering through the door with one of his corking ideas for getting me out of this soupy mess.

Roberson continued. "You might want to be careful. You-I'm sorry, the narrator-appears unusually fixated on his valet. People might get the wrong impression."

"Wrong impression? I'm simply telling the world what a marvellous chap Jeeves is. It is no more than the unvarnished truth. There's nothing wrong with that."

"I imagine Dr. Watson began in much the same way, and you see where it got him."

"Well, Mr. Holmes, remarkable though he may be, has a few, shall we say, less than admirable quirks of the sort that may make certain people look askance, whereas my Jeeves is a paragon in every way possible. He has not a single bad habit or flaw in character, unless you count his overly conservative sartorial sensibility. There's not a thing I could divulge about him which could cause him shame."

"Mr. Holmes's 'quirks' as you call them are not the problem." He smiled and looked at me with a steady gaze. "Do you even know what Mr. Holmes's crime is?"

"Whatever crime he's committed, I'm sure it was in the pursuit of justice."

Roberson laughed again. I was starting to wish he were a gloomier sort of villain; his merriment was getting on my nerves. "Aren't you curious? Wouldn't you like to see the papers that got you into this situation?"

My brow crinkled in perplexity. I couldn't imagine why he would offer to show me such a thing. I could not deny that I was indeed curious. How could I fail to be, when these papers, whatever they were, had brought Sherlock Holmes himself out of retirement and onto my doorstep? They must have been filled with vividly ripe details, and that thought more than anything is what curbed my inquisitiveness. One did not nose into one's guest's business, not unless one's guest asked one-or one's valet-to do so. Those papers were personal, and as such I could not in good conscience let them be exposed to the Wooster eyes and continue to call myself a preux chevalier.

"Thank you, but no," I said, thinking that it wouldn't hurt to be polite, even, or perhaps especially to a man who was, as the Americans say, "packing heat."

"Oh come now, not even a peek?" He held up the papers, but I turned my face away.

"I'd rather not."

"I insist." His voice was sliding from breezy to hard.

I was getting dashed irritated by the whole thing and forgot my earlier decision to remain polite. "I said, 'no.' In other words, 'no', 'not at all', 'by no means' and 'nothing doing'. One would think you'd never heard the bloody word before."

His lips twisted into an ugly snarl and the creases around his mouth deepened. Fearing that I'd gone too far, I started offering up prayers and saying my goodbyes to the things I loved most in the world, starting with Jeeves and ending with Anatole's excellent recipe for tartiflette. My preparations to meet my maker were unnecessary, however. Roberson's face cleared, a slight upturn of his lips all the expression that remained.

"Very well then," he said mildly. "I trust you don't mind if I read them, do you?"

Well, I couldn't deny him that, particularly seeing as he'd already read them at least once. "I have no objections."

"Good." He flipped through the pages and found the one he was looking for. He ostentatiously cleared his throat, and then began to read aloud in a resonant and perfectly enunciated voice, like a dramatic radio performer. My first instinct was to cover my ears, so as not to listen and thereby betray Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson's trust. Unfortunately, the restraints that bound my arms to the chair held fast and the only thing my struggles accomplished was to nearly tip me over.

With a touch of a sneer, Roberson recited:

When he kissed me, I jumped back in shock and, slack-jawed with astonishment, stared at the unfamiliar sight of desire flitting across his familiar features. His eyes were dark, the pupil so dilated that only a thin ring of silver could be seen. This, combined with the trembling of his hands and shine of sweat upon his brow, told me all I needed to know. That poison he injected into his veins was responsible for this aberrant behaviour. 

"Holmes!" I cried. "How much did you take?"

"I am not mad, John," he replied, reading my thoughts upon my face. "On the contrary, the cocaine has given me the strength and clarity of mind to make manifest what was always there." He kissed me again, and this time I did not draw away.

It was not fair to Holmes, who, no matter what he said, was not in his right mind. It was certainly not fair to poor Mary, who waited so patiently at home. Holmes's force of will, however, was like iron, and as I had no real wish to deny him this, I acquiesced to his wishes.

Roberson interrupted the narrative to comment, "Drugs, perverted sex, corruption of a married man...Mr Holmes did have a wild and dissolute youth, didn't he." He resumed reading, the passage growing increasingly...personal, but I was no longer paying much attention, lost as I was in a tumult of thought.

With very little context to explain the whys and wherefores of how Holmes and Watson came to be in this concupiscent position it came across as a bit sordid and lascivious��"all body and no heart��"although having met them, I could not believe that lust was all there was to it. A burning heat suffused my cheeks as I listened and had I been able to look in a mirror, I'm sure I would have seen a face red as a cherry reflected back at me.

What shocked me most was that I was not, in fact, very shocked at all. Aside from my natural discomfiture at hearing such intimate details of another's private life, I did not feel the usual range of surprise and disbelief that a chap might be expected to feel when it is revealed to him that two upstanding gentlemen of his acquaintance are on chummier terms than society would tolerate. The spat I'd witnessed which, in a friendship, would signal a distinct cooling of relations was, between a couple, just standard procedure��"or so it seemed from the couples I'd observed. I suppose it stems from the fact that friends can be sent away when one knows that one is not at one's best, whereas, if one is devoted to another and so spends the greater part of one's life with that other, occasional frictions are bound to arise, whether about serious affairs, like a deadly indiscretion, or simple ones, like hats and ties.

With this new understanding, I felt a greater sense of camaraderie with Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson. They were no longer just a pair of legends or heroes, but two men who were not so different from me. This made the breach of privacy brought about by Roberson's reading all the more intolerable. Gathering my courage, I interrupted him. "I think I've heard enough of this," I said loudly. "I don't know what you're trying to accomplish, but I tell you it won't work. My friend Bingo has recited far more scandalous stories at the Drones Club bar. Of course, the stories he reads usually feature a female somewhere in them, or sometimes two, but nevertheless, you will not wear down my spirit with indecent innuendo. Whatever relationship exists between Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, it's none of my business, or yours either. If you were any sort of true gentleman, you'd leave them alone instead of passing on gossip like a fishwife."

Roberson leapt from his chair, his face flushing with rage. "'True gentleman', is it?" he snarled, stalking towards me. "Like you, one of England's inbred? All haughtiness and indolence?"

Roberson puffed through his nose, in and out. The red faded from his face and the lines of fury curled back into smug tolerance. When he spoke again, his voice was mild. "I don't think you're taking your situation very seriously, Mr. Wooster. In your heart of hearts, you still think this is all a game, an exciting, fabulous game, much more thrilling than a petty matrimonial escapade. You think that any moment now your Jeeves will show up to rescue his Wooster-in-distress. You'll have a few laughs, and perhaps you'll even write the whole thing up as a novel." He raised the pages in his hand as if they were the hypothetical novel itself. "Mr. Wooster, let me assure you that by the time I'm finished, there will be a murder. Someone will die. It might even be you. Imagine it, your whole life extinguished. This is real, Mr. Wooster." He took up the gun and placed it against the side of my head. The barrel was cold against my temple and I shivered. "This pistol, these bullets, which are even now only inches from your brain, they're all real."

I wondered what would happen if I never left this room again. Would the police even find a body, or would I simply be one more corpse without a grave, buried in someone's back garden or dumped into the river? What would happen to Jeeves? He'd be all right, I was sure of it. A man like Jeeves wouldn't have a problem getting references, and would surely be swarmed by a bevy of prospective employers with Bertram Wooster out of the way. Still, I hoped he'd take a bonus before he left, as a gift from my posthumous self, and some books as well, maybe a trinket or two��"something personal, so he'll always remember me. Dash it all, he might as well take the whole kit-and-caboodle; he'd make better use of it than all the assorted family members who were the current beneficiaries of my will.

I wished that I could have told Jeeves how I felt before I died. It was quite tragic, like something out of Shakespeare: me dead, the love of my life never knowing how much I adored him. He would continue through his merry years, while I fed the worms. All the excuses I'd given to myself��"that Jeeves was my employee, that he would think I was exploiting him, that he would leave me, that he would stay but all would be ruined between us��"seemed like such paltry concerns next to that most terrible and immutable obstacle of all: death.

The circle of the gun's barrel drew away from my head. I opened my eyes. Until then, I hadn't been aware that I had closed them.

"No more games, Mr. Wooster." He dropped the gun on the table and picked up the telephone. "Now, tell me the telephone number for your flat. Once you have done that, do not say another word."

I nodded, staring at the gun that was still within his reach. I gave him the number, each digit recited in a flat, soft voice quite unlike my usual timbre. His words were still ringing in my ears and I felt not at all like myself. Roberson dialled and waited. In the stillness, I thought I heard Jeeves's murmur through the line, although it was more likely no more than wishful thinking on my part.

Roberson spoke. "Ah, this must be the inimitable Jeeves, paragon among paragons. I trust Mr. Holmes is still there."

I strained my ears, holding my breath and wishing I could stop the thumping of my heart so I could better hear Jeeves's much-missed voice. Then Roberson asked to speak to Holmes, and the opportunity was lost. They conversed back and forth, but I could only hear Roberson's side of the discussion. That made little sense without the context of the other, so I scarce paid any attention until my name was spoken.

"How far are you willing to go to save poor Mr. Wooster?" Roberson said. I took a great interest in Holmes's answer, as it intimately pertained to me, and cursed the fact that I couldn't hear it. Whatever Holmes said, it seemed to satisfy Roberson. He continued, "You know, during my time in prison, I read Dr. Watson's charming memoirs in The Strand magazine. Fascinating reading. According to the doctor, you once remarked that you thought you would have made an efficient criminal. I offer you a chance to find out. I want the Jewels of Tarpeia, and you are going to steal them for me."

Stinging sweat dripped into my eye as I waited for the verdict with my heart in my throat and chest tight from the little gasps of air that fright forced in and out of me. The pause was an uncomfortably long one. When Roberson finally spoke again, his words did nothing to alleviate my worries.

"If you refuse, Mr. Wooster's brain matter will decorate the wall."

I swallowed hard. I was quite happy with my brain where it was. It may not have been much, but it was mine, and I was keen to keep it safely within the confines of my skull. Roberson was paying no attention to my distress. He smiled and stroked two fingers down the telephone shaft. "The packet? You can't procure two priceless possessions-a life and a reputation-with only one priceless relic. I'll keep the packet for now. Perhaps you'll have an opportunity to purchase it from me later."

Holmes must have said something about Roberson's general trustworthiness and lack thereof, for Roberson replied in an affronted tone, "I give you my word. A gentleman's word is his bond. For all my faults, I always keep my word."

Then there was talk of times and places for exchanging me for the jewels, all very calm, all very professional. To these two cold-blooded men, I was nothing more than a commodity to be bought and sold. As chilling as that sensation was, it did not raise the hairs on my head as much as Roberson's parting words did. It was not the words themselves, although they were alarming enough, but the nonchalance with which he spoke them that really turned my blood to ice.

"Mr. Holmes, I don't think I need to tell you that if you involve the police in any way, Mr. Wooster dies. If you attempt to find me, he dies. If you fail to get the jewels, he dies. If you think to trap me during the exchange, he dies. If you go against my wishes in any way-well, I think you get the point. Good night, Mr. Holmes."

Roberson hung up the telephone and chortled merrily to himself. I closed my eyes tight and tried to pretend that I was back in my flat, in my bed, about to be awoken by Jeeves with his flawless tea tray. But the pins and needle in my hands from the too-tight bonds, and the damp smell of the air, and Roberson's cackle tore my every fantasy apart, and ensured that I could not escape the reality of my peril.
