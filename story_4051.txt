Teresa prepares to rescue David from the women of WOPI. But 
what if David does not want to be rescued?

Chapter 7 - Teresa to the Rescue

"Because it has all the markings of a wild goose chase, 
that's why!" Rutherford Brady was almost shouting now. He had 
never expected Teresa to accept his "no" easily, but she was 
very persistent. "How can you be so sure you can find the 
place?"

"The tech boys place the latitude and longitude about 45 Km. 
northeast of Cadiz. There is a little town there, Alqueria, 
where I can look around. A complex the size David describes 
can't be hidden.

"And why you, instead of one of our Spanish agents?"

"For one, they may have been compromised. For another I'm as 
expert in hypnotic control as anyone in NASO. Finally, can 
any of them hope to get into the place passing for a Latin 
American 'indocumentada' looking for work as a maid?"

Rutherford gazed at Teresa. She sure didn't look like a maid 
right now in her black, shrink-wrap miniskirt and demi-bra. 
He tried to imagine the dark-skinned fireball in scruffy 
clothes, but all he could come up with was her in no clothes 
at all. He shook his head. She had a point. She could look 
the part of an illiterate peasant, as he knew her 
grandparents had been. Teresa had used raw intelligence (and 
her stunningly sexy body), fueled by a passionate hatred of 
the drug traffickers who had murdered an older brother, to 
claw her way into and then up the NASO hierarchy.

Moreover, Rutherford knew she wasn't going to give up because 
it was David. He was a friend but he had been more than that. 
They had become lovers almost as soon as she arrived from the 
Central American branch. Everyone knew it could not last; 
each was too dominant, but for a few months they had carried 
on an incandescent affair.

"Oh, Rudie, you know I'll do a good job, for YOU. I want you 
to be proud of me," she to cooed. 

Somehow the cleavage between those large, mouthwatering 
breast seemed to grow. Warning bells started going off all 
over Rutherford's brain. He didn't want to give Teresa an 
excuse to try to seduce him; he was pretty sure she'd 
succeed. Knowing when he was beaten, Rutherford sighed, "Very 
well, Teri, start preparations."

"Actually, I have completed them. I just have one more thing 
to take care of in the office," she smiled.

Presumptuous of her to anticipate his agreement, but typical, 
Rutherford mused as he watched Teri's sinuous hips wiggle out 
the door. He wondered if he had done the right thing. Damn! 
No panty lines.

Back in the office, Teri checked her air tickets and computer 
security protocols to see that everything was in order. 
Clothes and disguise had been packed last night. Yes, just 
one more piece of business she needed to take care of before 
leaving. She wasn't going to have much opportunity for sex 
for she didn't know how long. Better go off as well satisfied 
as possible. "Ralph, " she spoke into the intercom, "come in 
please, I NEED you.

She had removed and folded her blouse and was unhooking her 
bra when the young man came in with his steno pad. His eyes 
grew wide with concern when he saw his sexy boss half-naked. 
"Oh, no, Ms Carrillo! You're not going on mission, again, are 
you?" A strange look of fear and excitement came over him.

"Ralph, sweetie, you knew when I hired you, it wasn't just 
for your shorthand. You know what I need!" Teresa almost 
growled with lust.

"Ms ... Ms ... Carrillo, do you want us ... You want me ... 
to make love to you?

"Oh, Ralph, honey" she cooed as she slinked closer. The 
jiggle of her dark breasts reached out and seized the young 
man's eyes. "How sweet of you to even THINK about making love 
to a grown-up woman like me. Of course I wouldn't ask that of 
you."

A mixture of relief and disappointment flickered across 
Ralph's face. Now he was really confused as Teresa continued 
approaching him with the same fire in her eye. Her hands were 
on the zipper of her skirt and her magnificent tits were 
undulating marvelously.

"You can put any thought of making love to me right out of 
your mind, honey," she husked. "All I want is for you to bend 
me over this armchair and fuck the daylights out of me!" 
Teresa said matter of factly as she dropped her skirt.

"But warm me up, first, baby," she instructed and pressed the 
astonished young man onto his knees. "Yesss!" she hissed and 
drew his face into her already dripping bush. Some time later 
with the assistance of the staff of her staff assistant, 
Teresa was howling in ecstasy through her umpteenth orgasm.

Down the hall Teresa's cries of delight were clearly audible. 
Rutherford sometimes wished agent Carrillo could find some 
more conventional way to prepare for fieldwork. He knew, 
however, that Ethyl would be pleasantly surprised that night, 
although secrecy as well as modesty would not allow him to 
explain source of his ardor. He seldom made love to his wife 
as vigorously as on the days that Teri left on a journey. And 
he was pretty sure that the conception of several babies born 
to women working on this floor could be traced to the same 
phenomenon.

Even before the last of Teri's howls had died away Rutherford 
heard drawers and file cabinets being closed and locked as 
people began to rush home to take care of suddenly urgent 
business. Using a washroom in the next several minutes could 
also be embarrassing.

A half-hour later, when Teresa's heels were clicking smartly 
down the corridor heading for the exit and a waiting car, few 
were around to hear them.

*****

Several thousand miles away Captain David Knight, if somehow 
he could have known of the goings on back at NASO 
Headquarters, would have been utterly incapable of 
understanding what all the fuss was about. He certainly would 
not have felt any need for being rescued. He was spending 
another wonderful day with his new girlfriend. Claire didn't 
give him as much attention as the first days after they met 
(that was getting pretty fuzzy now, anyway) but she still 
made him feel special.

Every night after dinner, even if he had eaten alone and was 
already dozing off, Claire came to him. It was heaven to feel 
her slip into his bed and let her take him in her arms. As if 
her weren't already sleepy enough, she would place a hard, 
firm nipple of one of her perfect breasts into his mouth and 
allow him to nurse as she whispered soothing words to him. It 
never failed to send him off to dreamland.

Later -- he never knew how much later, time with Claire was 
always fuzzy -- he often woke up enough to realize that his 
marvelous, sexy girlfriend was ready for him to please her. 
What a joy and privilege he felt that she had chosen him to 
bring her pleasure with his mouth and tongue between her 
legs. Day after day she had gently instructed him in her 
preferences and he felt a deep pride in knowing just how to 
bring her to orgasm after orgasm. His reward was to be 
permitted to drink the rich spend of her climaxes. He adored 
the way she tasted as he did everything about her.

Sometimes when she was especially pleased with his service or 
particularly horny, she would fuck him. To lie on his back, 
looking up through half-closed eyes at her golden hair flying 
and her rounded white breasts bouncing up and down as she 
rode him to orgasm, was recompense far beyond his deserts. 
And the sleep that overcame him when she at last let him come 
in her was the sweetest slumber a man could experience.

David sensed more than remembered how they slept when she was 
finished making love to him and wanted to be held, her large 
ass pressed into the crook of his crotch, one of his arms 
under her neck and the other over her waist, his face buried 
in her neck. She held his hands, sometimes clasping the upper 
one to her breast if she wanted to be felt up one more time. 
If she rolled, he moved to compensate, maintaining as close 
contact of their bodies as the male and female anatomies 
permitted.

Mornings were almost as good as nights. Claire was very 
generous with her time, letting David spend many long lazy 
minutes drinking her essence before she arose. It was almost 
incredible to think that this perfect woman let HIM put his 
face between her soft plump thighs and bring her to one 
screaming morning climax after another. Then when she was at 
last well satisfied, she drew his head to her bosom and put 
him back to sleep with her luscious breasts and soft words.

When he woke again after Claire had gone, he headed for the 
gym. Claire insisted he stay in shape; "It improves your 
stamina, darling," she had explained. After lunch he was 
always sleepy and napped in his bed, drifting off to soft 
music. Later, he was free to return to the gym or read or 
just sit and fantasize about her and reflect on his good 
fortune to share the bed and body of this most wonderful 
creature.

When the time came, he would not fail her.
