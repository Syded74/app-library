Willow,
First and foremost – I love you. Second, I know you love me too. Really and truly, don’t doubt that. We’re going on that date soon, tonight if we get the chance. I’m going to the vineyard. Don’t worry about me. I swear to God, if you worry about me, I’m gonna kick your ass when I get home. And I do mean home. Go home, Will. I’ll meet you there when I’ve gotten whatever Caleb’s protecting and we’ll figure out what happens next. Thank you for everything you said last night. And thank Spike too. Both of you really helped me. I know I can do this, so – just for good measure – DON’T WORRY. I love you and I’ll see you at home and also I love you.
-Buffy

“Willow.” Spike’s voice drifted through the halls. “Thought I heard – where’s Buffy?” Stopping in the doorway, Spike looked suspiciously at the note in Willow’s hand.

“She left,” Willow said tonelessly.

“You let her go alone?” asked Spike incredulously.

“Well, ‘let’ is a bit of a stretch,” the witch pointed out. “I was kind of asleep. Hence – you know, the note.” She waved the piece of paper in reminder.

“Right.” Spike frowned thoughtfully.

“She’ll be okay,” said Willow reassuringly. “And she says thanks – for the stuff you said last night.”

“I thought your bit was better,” replied the vampire. “Passionate and all.”

“Please,” Willow dismissed. “My stuff was just babble – what you said was really beautiful.”

“You think so?”

“Yeah,” Willow told him softly. “I think – you’re a hell of a man, Spike.”

“Well, thanks for that,” said Spike with a smile. “You alright?”

“I am,” she answered confidently, getting out of the bed. “I mean, I wish she could have told me to my face, but I get it.”

“And you’re not worried about her?” Spike raised his eyebrows inquisitively.

“Not really,” said Willow with a shrug. “She can take him. I’m more worried about…” Trailing off, she stared behind Spike’s shoulder.

“What?” Spike turned to see a glowing orange ball of light drift into the room.

“Finally!” Xander exclaimed as he followed the locator spell’s light.

“Told you I did it right,” Dawn added smugly as she came in behind him. “Oh…so much for undercover,” she noted at the sight of Willow and Spike. “So, where’s Buffy?”

“What, now you care?” said Willow dryly.

“Will…” Xander said gently.

“Willow,” the teen stared at her in confusion. “I-I didn’t mean to – hurt you.”

“No, just Buffy then?” Willow snapped. “Well, gee, I feel so much better now.”

“Will,” said Xander again, more firmly. “Look, we’re not here to fight.”

“I think I missed something,” Spike commented. “I thought Faith was… Why are we so brassed off at Dawnie?”

Willow huffed in reply.

“Look,” Dawn insisted moodily, “I’m sorry that you don’t understand-”

“Just leave it,” Willow sighed in exasperation.

“Willow…”

“If you try to justify it…just don’t,” instructed Willow flatly.

“Will,” Xander tried a third time, “where is she?”

“Doing what everyone else is too afraid to do,” Willow answered coldly. “Again.”

“Oh God,” Xander offered sympathetically.

“Did you expect anything less of her?” challenged Willow, heading for the door. “She’s coming back to the house when she’s done. We should be there.”

“The house – as in not this house?” Xander verified.

“That’s right,” Willow confirmed. “Spike, we’ll see you after sunset.”

“Yeah,” said Spike, making himself comfortable on the bed.

“Willow,” Dawn spoke up again. “Can’t we even-”

“Dawn, I’m hurt,” said Willow tonelessly. “I’m hurt and I’m angry – and if we talk, then I’m gonna say hurt, angry things that I may or may not want to take back later. Just leave it, already.”

“So…” Xander followed a few paces behind Willow, back out of the door Buffy had kicked down the previous night. Dawn walked quietly behind him. “We’re just – just headed home?”

“That’s right,” Willow confirmed.

“But – shouldn’t we be helping her? I mean, if she’s going up against Caleb-”

“She can handle it, Xand,” responded Willow. “So, what about Faith?”

“Puttin’ her own plan into action,” Xander answered. “We kidnapped a Bringer.”

“Why?”

“We made it talk,” Dawn supplied. “There was this old Turkish spell for talking to the dying.”

“It told us they’re building an arsenal for the, uh, inevitable battle,” said Xander.

“Let me get this straight,” Willow requested. “You guys trust a Bringer – witless pawn of the ultimate evil – more than you trust Buffy?”

“Not the nicest way to put it,” Xander pointed out.

“No meaner than ‘Oh, I’m trying to see your point, but it must be to my left’,” the witch retorted. “God, that was tactless.”

“Tactless!” Xander protested. “It’s my eye-”

“That she feels responsible for!” Willow raged. “And then you go and throw it in her face like that. I get that you didn’t see her point, but that was just rude.”

“I lose my eye and I can’t even make a joke about it now?” Xander demanded. “I wasn’t trying to be rude.”

“I know that,” Willow pledged. “Really, I get it…” Her tone began to soften slightly. “I just thought you should know how she feels.”

“Fine, I put my foot in my mouth,” Xander acknowledged. “What else is new?”

“A Bringer,” Willow scoffed. “Is it so impossible to think that the evil people might lie to you?”

“It’s a Bringer, Will. Not exactly a master of subtlety and deceit.”

“But The First is,” Willow explained. “Faith could be walking into a trap.”

“Well, I’m thinkin’ Faith can probably handle herself too,” Xander reasoned. “One way or another, she’ll probably be back before we even get there.”

“I hope you’re right.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“They’re back,” Anya called out, walking through the front door.

“Faith?” Giles prompted.

“Oh – no,” she corrected. “Xander and Dawn.”

“Is Buffy with them?” the Watcher inquired.

“Well – no,” Anya admitted.

“Hey,” said Xander, walking in through the door Anya had left open.

“Did you find Buffy?” questioned Giles.

“No,” Xander informed him.

“Not exactly,” Dawn qualified, entering behind Xander.

“Hey,” Willow added as she came in and shut the door behind her.

“Willow,” said Giles in a tone of surprise.

“Mr. Giles,” she acknowledged him coldly.

Giles looked to Xander in question.

“Apparently Will’s doing the whole righteous anger thing,” Xander offered informatively.

“Yes, well,” Giles mumbled awkwardly. “Um – how is Buffy?”

“Fine,” Willow decided after a moment. “She’s gonna stop by later.”

“Stop by,” said Giles, “or come back?”

“Don’t know.” Willow shrugged and helped herself to some of the food the potentials had left on the table. “You guys raid a grocery store?”

“I thought – I thought Andrew might like to be useful,” Giles answered.

“I’ve been – keeping morale up,” Andrew supplemented. “Because that’s important.”

“Yes,” Giles agreed. “I’m afraid Faith hasn’t returned with the other girls yet. It would seem something has gone wrong.”

“We have to go to her.” Willow marched again to the front door.

“Guess so,” said Xander, nodding sadly.

“Yes,” Andrew cheered them on. “I’ll stay here – keep working on that morale thing.” He sipped his Capri-Sun pouch uncertainly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Look, Xand…” Willow began softly as Xander drove. “I’m sorry I snapped at you.”

“Don’t worry about it,” he dismissed.

“Really though,” continued Willow. “You were – you know, reasonable. I mean, I still think Buffy’s right, but – well, like I said, I’m sorry. It’d be stupid to let this come between us.”

“You care about her,” Xander answered. “I get that.”

“Guess you do,” Willow admitted.

“We should be close to where they went in,” he informed her. “You wanna try the psychic thing?”

“On it,” Willow assured him.

*Faith.*

“She’s not answering.”

“Let’s not assume the worst,” said Xander nervously. “Maybe she’s just focused on something. Try Kennedy.”

*Kennedy.*

*Willow?* the potential Slayer responded after a moment. *What the hell?*

“Got her,” said Willow. Xander sighed in relief.

*Magic thing,* the witch explained. *Giles said you guys were supposed to be back by now. What’s going on?*

*There was a bomb.*

“A bomb,” said Willow aloud. Xander accelerated.

*We’re coming. Me and Xander. Not a lot of room, but the ones in the worst shape…*

*Faith’s out cold.*

*Is she…?*

*It’s bad. She has a pulse, but…* Kennedy didn’t finish the thought.

*Where are you guys exactly?*

*Almost out of the sewer tunnel. Tell Xander it’s where we came in.*

“Where they went in, they’re almost there.”

*Anything else we should watch for?*

*Well, there were three Ubervamps.*

*Were?*

*Buffy took them out.*

*Buffy’s with you? … Hang on.* Willow opened up her mind, allowing the conversation to carry between more people. *Buffy?*

“What?” asked Xander next to her. “Buffy’s there too?”

“Think it, Xand,” Willow instructed.

*Willow, thank God,* came Buffy’s answer.

*Whoa, this just got twice as freaky,* Kennedy commented.

*Xander and I are coming,* Willow assured the Slayer. *Anyone who can’t walk can ride.*

*So what’s the what?* asked Xander.

*There was a bomb,* Kennedy informed him. *And then these three Ubervamps. And Buffy took them out like they were nothing.*

*Guessing you found what you were looking for, then,* Willow noted, grinning smugly at Xander.

*Big time,* Buffy replied. *We’re coming out of the tunnel now.*

*I see you,* thought Willow as they neared their destination. A small gathering of girls awaited them, some supported between others and many bleeding freely.

“…not a lot of room,” Buffy was saying to the group as Xander and Willow got out of the car. “That means just the worst. If you can still walk, you’re walking.”

“Hey,” Willow offered gently as she walked up behind Buffy and placed a supportive hand on the Slayer’s shoulder.

“Load ‘em up, girls,” she instructed.

“Shiny new toy,” observed the witch as the potentials started moving.

“Powerful too,” said Buffy, holding up the Scythe. “I can sense it.”

“I always knew you’d leave me for something phallic,” Willow teased.

“Hey,” Buffy spoke softly, “I’m sorry about that.”

“No, it’s okay,” said Willow calmingly. “Really this time. Not even a tear. I mean, I get it. You really didn’t have to go alone, but…”

“I wasn’t alone,” Buffy told her quietly. “You were with me – in my heart.”

“You’re such a sap sometimes.”

“Really though,” continued the Slayer. “You gave me strength.”

“I guess I’m just amazing that way.”

“Speaking of…”

“Uh-oh.” Willow frowned slightly.

“Any chance you can work some healing mojo?” Buffy requested, gesturing toward a group of girls easing Faith into the backseat.

“I can try a couple of little things,” said Willow. “Maybe more at home with some supplies.”

“Anything helps.”

“Okay. Here goes.” Willow took a deep breath and extended her hand in the direction of the wounded Slayer. “Exsisto vigoratus quod exsisto universus.” There was a flash of pale light and then an ominous roaring sound. A second light flashed and Willow dropped to her knees, hair changing smoothly from red to black.

“Will!” Buffy knelt beside her, taking the witch’s hand in her own.

“I’m here,” Willow said forcefully. “It’s – it’s me.” And as she said it, her hair changed back just as quickly.

“I’m sorry,” Buffy assured her quickly.

“No, I’m fine,” Willow insisted.

*It’s here,* she added in her thoughts. *It’s blocking me.*

“Double time, girls,” Buffy called to the potentials, tightening her hold on the scythe.

*It wants me afraid,* thought Willow.

*Are you?*

*Don’t let go of my hand.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“The only thing I know for sure is it made Caleb back off in a hurry.” Buffy addressed Willow and Giles, the latter of whom was examining the scythe.

“So it’s true, scythe matters,” said Willow with a giggle.

“And – ignoring that,” said Giles, “I’d just like to point out that this really is quite ingenious.” He began sparring with thin air.

“Kills strong bodies three ways,” Buffy noted dryly.

“And you say you sense something when you hold it?” Willow verified.

“Not much, but it’s strong,” answered the Slayer. “And I knew it belonged to me… I just knew it.”

“In addition to being ancient, it’s clearly mystical,” Giles said wisely.

“Yeah, I figured that one out when I King-Arthur’ed it out of the stone,” Buffy replied.

“So, maybe it’s like some kind of traditional Slayer weapon,” suggested Willow.

“I can’t imagine how something like this could exist without my having heard of it,” Giles pondered.

“Well, the good guys are not traditionally known for their communication skills,” Buffy reasoned sadly.

“Right.” Giles sat on the bed carefully, trying not to disturb Faith’s recovery. “Um…any chance that it might be something other than a tool for killing things?”

“The First’s guys clearly wanted it out of that stone,” said Buffy informatively. “It’s not just a tool. It’s important. We need to find out whatever we can. Who made it, when, why? Does it have a name? I don’t know,” she shrugged, “a credit report? Just find out fast.”

“We’ll start work immediately,” Giles assured her.

“Yeah, don’t worry, Buff,” Willow added. “We’ll find out everything there is to know.”

“Good,” said Buffy, “because right now, that thing’s all we’ve got going for us. And hey,” she commented as Willow opened her laptop. “How does that thing work without electricity? All the power went out last night, didn’t it?”

“I might be cheating a little,” Willow pointed out.

“Not blocked anymore then?”

“Don’t jinx it,” cautioned the witch.

“Okay…” Buffy stood hesitantly for a moment. “Willow, before you-”

“No.”

“What?” questioned Buffy.

“I know you, Buffy,” Willow explained. “I know what you wanna ask and the answer is no…for a lot of reasons.”

“Give me one.”

“I love you.”

“Give me another.”

“I can be more useful here. Ask Xander.”

“Now give me the real reason.”

“Perhaps I should – give you two a moment,” Giles suggested, setting the Scythe next to the bed and leaving in a hurry. “Willow, call me when we begin the research.”

“Will, what is this?” Buffy asked her softly. “I need someone I can trust.”

“I can’t, Buffy,” persisted Willow. “Please, just ask Xander to do it.”

“You really do know what I’m asking for, right?” the Slayer verified. “I mean, I don’t wanna find out this is all about a miscommunication. I need you to take-”

“Found this.” Quietly, she passed Buffy a note, a note that the Slayer had written.

“Okay…” Buffy allowed.

“Ask Xander.”

“You’re stronger than he is,” Buffy said forcefully.

“Buffy, please just listen to me when I tell you – I can’t.”

“Tell me why…please.”

“I don’t trust myself,” said Willow meekly, eyes starting to water. “If I – lost control – do you remember? When I was – with the – what I threatened to do to her…”

There was a pause as they both reflected on Willow’s words.

“Will, that’s not-”

“Last night,” Willow interrupted. “When – i-it was just for a second – but – Buffy, I wanted to…” A tear slipped down her cheek, quickly followed by others.

“But that was probably just-”

“It wasn’t,” said Willow flatly, sniffling impatiently. “It wasn’t The First. It wasn’t the power… Buffy, it was me… And that’s why I can’t... I don’t know that I’d always be able to hold back. Especially without you there. I feel terrible – f-for even thinking it… but I thought it.”

“Willow…” said Buffy blankly.

“I’m so sorry,” she offered weakly.

“No.” Buffy wrapped her arms around Willow as she sobbed. “Willow, you don’t have to feel sorry.”

“Don’t dismiss this one, Buffy.”

“You held back,” the Slayer replied. “You don’t have to feel sorry for thinking it.”

“You would never think it. I shouldn’t – I – there was a time when I wouldn’t have. Before – everything…”

“It’s okay,” Buffy whispered gently. “I love you, Will.” Heavier sobs met this statement. “I know.”

“I wish I was – better than that.”

“You are,” Buffy pledged. “It was an errant thought, Will. Don’t beat yourself up over it.”

“I’m sorry,” Willow repeated.

“It – was – a – thought,” Buffy returned emphatically. “You were angry and you had an angry thought. There’s nothing wrong with that. I still trust you… But I won’t make you do this if you’re not comfortable with it.”

“I’m sorry,” Willow softly responded. “Those other reasons are real too.”

“Okay,” said Buffy kindly.

“You can trust Xander too.”

“I know,” Buffy vowed. “I trust you more – but I know he can do what needs to be done. You know I only asked because I trust you, right? … It’s not like you’re in my way. I do want you here, but I also want…”

“I know.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Do you sense any of the power that Buffy spoke about?” Giles questioned. They had taken their research down to the dining room, not wanting to disturb Faith’s rest with their discussions. Willow stood perfectly still, holding the Scythe and trying to understand why Caleb feared it.

“Gotta say no,” she admitted. “Must be a Slayer thing.”

“Tapping into magicks might help with that,” suggested the Watcher.

“Maybe,” said Willow reluctantly. “But, I mean, if Caleb’s afraid of this thing, it must be pretty dangerous. And tapping into that…” Carefully, she set the weapon down again.

“Willow, you could do it without endangering yourself,” Giles reasoned.

“If I tried something big, I’d change,” Willow insisted apprehensively. “And then it’s all black hair and veins and lightning bolts… I can hardly do a locator spell without getting dark roots.”

“And if it was necessary?” prompted Giles.

“Honestly? I don’t know.” She returned to her laptop.

“Alright,” Giles sighed. “Do what you can. That’s all any of us can do.”

“I guess so.” Willow echoed the sigh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Thank God we’re hot chicks with superpowers,” Faith noted.

“Takes the edge off,” Buffy agreed.

“Comforting.”

“Mm-hm,” added Buffy, nodding thoughtfully. “And, you know, I’ve got Willow.”

“She takes the edge off too, huh?” Faith teased.

“No – well, yeah,” admitted the blonde with a blush. “But more than that, she understands. I mean, she doesn’t actively bear the burden, but she gets it. It’s – it’s really wonderful.”

“Well, bully for you,” Faith said with bravado.

“You should try it,” Buffy told her quietly.

“What, lesbianism?”

“Letting someone in,” she clarified.

“Ah, you know me.”

“Yes, I do,” said Buffy pointedly. “You don’t have to take it – but that’s my advice.”

Their eyes met meaningfully for a brief second and then they looked away as footsteps approached.

“Hey,” said Willow warmly as she walked into the room.

“Will.” Buffy smiled at the new arrival smiled and they kissed hello.

“Got a lead,” announced the witch.

“Great,” Buffy enthused.

“Here.” Willow passed Buffy some scrap paper on which she had written directions to Buffy’s destination. “It’s a pagan temple – sort of a mausoleum from the sound of it. Something about a tomb on unconsecrated ground.”

“I’m on the case,” Buffy pledged readily as she and Willow leaned in for another kiss. “And, maybe when we get back, we can go on that date…if you think you’re ready.”

“I’d love to.”

“Does that mean you want the bed back?” Faith asked them.

“Only if you’re gonna wash the sheets first,” Buffy quipped.

“Wash the – what?” asked Willow confusion.

“She and Robin, uh – got bouncy.”

“Ugh!” Willow glared at Faith. “We’re gone for one night and you try to claim our bed?”

“Hey, it just happened,” said Faith, holding her hands out innocently. “You guys were gone. And Kennedy kicked me out so she could get busy with Vi.”

“Oh my God,” said Buffy flatly. “Did everyone just turn into horny bunnies while we were gone?”

“Got a problem?” Faith challenged.

“Yes! I mean if I can’t have sex, then everyone else should just knock it off.”

“That’s what I said,” Anya commented, striding casually into the room with bandages for Faith. “Right before Xander and I had sex on the kitchen floor.”

“Ugh!” said Buffy and Willow together.

“Right on!” Faith congratulated her with a smile.

“Did someone just drop – alien – sex – pollen or something onto this house?” Buffy demanded.

“You know, I think it’s getting to me too,” Willow said softly in the Slayer’s ear.

“Faith, I want you out of my room by the time I get back,” Buffy commanded immediately. “Tell Kennedy she has to give you the bed.”

“I’m healing,” Faith said dismissively as Anya changed her bandages. “I can take Red’s old sleeping bag.”

“Just – don’t have sex in it,” said Willow.

“You two really are quite prudish,” Anya told them. “Aren’t lesbians supposed to be very liberal-minded? You guys are just stifling the sex wherever you can. I mean, you sent Xander away-”

“I didn’t send him away,” Buffy corrected indignantly. “I needed-”

“And you’re moving Faith in with Kennedy, effectively stopping both of them from having sex.”

“Kinda still in recovery,” said Faith bluntly. “And it’s not like I’m lookin’ to repeat with the Principal.”

“Yes, you never were much for reflection, were you?” Anya said with a nod.

“Could be reflection,” Willow allowed, “or it could be your run-of-the-mill Slayer intimacy issues.”

“Hey!” said Faith and Buffy together.

“Well,” Willow replied with an apologetic shrug. “You know, maybe that’s why Robin’s attracted to Slayers – because he never felt close to his mom.”

“Finally,” Anya exclaimed. “I was wondering if anyone would ever mention his oedipal complex.”

“Okay, this conversation has gone through too many kinds of weird,” Buffy announced.

“I’ll second that,” decided Faith. “Go do your thing, B,” she added. “You want the room, I’ll clear out after the tact queen is done patchin’ me up.”

“Thank you, Faith,” said Buffy fervently.

“Hope Ken and Vi aren’t too pissed about it,” Faith mused.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Hey,” Vi mumbled as she entered Kennedy’s room.

“I was starting to wonder if you were going to come,” noted Kennedy, lounging casually on the bed.

“Kinda needed a big dinner,” said Vi, crossing to the bed and sitting on the edge.

“So, how’s the arm?” Kennedy prompted.

“Mr. Giles says it’s probably not broken, but… I’m not supposed to do anything – strenuous.”

“Okay,” said Kennedy softly.

“I guess there’s – not much reason for me to be up here.”

“What do you mean?” Kennedy took Vi’s good hand in one of her own.

“Well, we can’t have sex…”

“So?” She kissed Vi’s hand affectionately.

“I mean – don’t you want to?” Vi questioned.

“Yes,” Kennedy pledged quietly. “But it’s not like we have to… Don’t you want to stay?”

“I-I just – thought you might not want…”

“I want you to stay, Vi,” Kennedy assured her. “It’s not like I’m going to start demanding sex every night.”

“What if I demand it?” said Vi with a smile. “I mean – you know, after the arm.”

“How about we both just ask for it,” suggested the brunette.

“Sounds like a plan.” Vi pulled herself closer to Kennedy. “I just meant – I don’t want you to think I don’t want to.”

“Remember that relaxing thing we talked about?”

“Okay.” Vi smiled at her again.

“I love you.”

“Thanks,” said Vi warmly. “Oh – I mean, I love you too.”

“Thanks,” Kennedy responded with a smirk. “Remember, you’re not my sex slave, you’re my girlfriend.”

“What if I wanna be both?”

“Well…” Kennedy put on a thoughtful expression. “Maybe we can work something out.” She leaned forward for a kiss.

“God, I want you,” Vi panted breathily as their lips separated.

“Well, if you want it that bad – we could try,” Kennedy offered. “I can be gentle.”

“I know that,” answered Vi. “I’m more worried about – you know, uncontrollable flailing.”

“Okay,” Kennedy allowed. “We can wait until you’re healed.”

“I wish we healed as fast as Buffy and Faith,” Vi lamented.

“I heard she’s awake now,” said Kennedy conversationally. “Faith, I mean.”

“Yeah,” Vi confirmed. “Buffy said they were gonna talk about that axe thing last time I saw her.”

“I’m glad she’s okay. Can you imagine what would happen if one of us got activated now?”

“I don’t know if I’d mind,” Vi reasoned. “At least then I might be useful.”

“What are you talking about? Vi, you’re great in a fight.”

“Maybe against Bringers and vamps,” allowed the redhead, “but nothing like Buffy…”

They both paused as someone knocked on the door.

“Who is it?” Vi called out.

“Faith,” the Slayer answered from the other side. “You guys decent?”

“Yeah, we’re good,” Kennedy assured her. “And we’d probably lock the door if we were doing anything,” she added as Faith entered.

“Right, guess I wasn’t thinking,” said Faith.

“So…do you need something?” Kennedy asked.

“Oh – moving in,” Faith informed them. “Orders from B. Where’s Red’s sleeping bag at?”

“Um, the closet,” said Kennedy.

“You can have the bed,” Vi offered. “I mean,” she turned to Kennedy, “she can, right?”

“Yeah,” Kennedy agreed.

“Wannabes, chill,” Faith said commandingly. “I got Slayer healing. Keep the bed.”

“I wonder if I’ll ever get a normal roommate,” Kennedy pondered.

“Not too likely,” said Vi, laying her head on Kennedy’s shoulder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Honey, you’re home,” said Spike casually as he met Buffy walking through the front door.

“Please don’t add ‘honey’ to your repertoire,” Buffy answered.

“Right, sorry.” Spike sighed, shutting the door behind him. “Looks like you did it,” he noted, nodding at the Scythe in Buffy’s hand. “Fulfilled your mission. Found the Holy Grail. Or the Holy Hand Grenade, or whatever the hell it is.”

“Right now, we’re going with Scythe,” Buffy informed him. “You like?”

“Well, pointy and wooden is not exactly a look I wanna know better,” Spike commented as they walked into the kitchen, “but it does have flair. And, uh, about – last night – that stuff I said-”

“Don’t you dare take it back,” cautioned the Slayer. “It meant a lot to me.”

“Oh – well – good then,” the vampire decided. “Actually, not good,” he changed his mind. “What the hell does that mean?”

“Does it have to mean something?” Buffy challenged. “You encouraged me and you care about me – I appreciate both of those things. It doesn’t have to mean anything – relationshipy. I care about you too.”

“I think I actually prefer it if it doesn’t mean anything,” Spike reasoned. “The idea of – anything happening – it terrifies me,” he told her quietly. Buffy watched his face in silence. “If you poke fun at me, you bloody well better use that,” he added, pointing to the Scythe, “’cause I couldn’t bear it.”

“I wouldn’t,” Buffy assured him. “Poke fun, that is. I care about you, Spike. Your support means a lot to me… It’s why you’re here.”

“Don’t make a scene of it,” said Spike dismissively. “Back to business, alright.”

“Okay,” Buffy allowed. “I’ve got work to do anyway.”

“Big secret mission?” Spike questioned.

“It’s not a secret,” said Buffy levelly. “Well, I mean, it is, but that’s the point of the mission. Find out the secret.” Holding up the Scythe again, she continued, “This thing was forged by – I don’t even know. I mean, something about – a tomb on unconsecrated ground. That’s what I have to do,” she stated bluntly. “I need to find out what this is and why I have it. This may actually help me fight my war. This could be the key to everything.”

“And that’s the thing the preacher man was so anxious to keep out of your mitts?” Spike verified.

“That it is,” said Buffy.

“Well, maybe I’ll swing by the vineyard when you go,” suggested the vampire, “make sure he’s sitting tight.”

“Great.”

“Okay,” said Spike, turning to leave. “We’ll go be heroes.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“I was kind of hoping it’d go this way,” taunted Caleb. He reared back with the Scythe, eyes locked on Buffy’s neck.

“Hey!” a male voice called out.

Caleb turned and caught a fist in his face. Looking up, Buffy saw Angel standing there with a large grin on his face as he surveyed the Slayer. He held out a hand and helped her to her feet.

“I was never much for preachers,” Angel mused.

“Angel,” Buffy said blankly, unsure of what his sudden appearance could mean.

“You look good,” he noted.

“You look timely,” she told him. “And also good.”

“Heard maybe you needed a hand,” said Angel as Caleb got to his feet. Buffy held out a hand to stop the vampire. “Ah, one of those things you need to finish yourself,” he verified.

“Really kinda is,” said Buffy plainly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Willow sat on Buffy’s bed with her laptop, browsing casually in search of further information about the Scythe, but so far finding nothing.

“Hey,” said a wonderfully familiar voice in the doorway.

“Buffy,” Willow exclaimed, looking up in surprise. “That was quick.”

“I guess I’m just amazing like that,” the Slayer teased.

“So…how’d it go?” prompted the witch.

“Actually – I need you to come with me,” admitted the Slayer hesitantly. “There’s something I need you to take a look at.”

“Okay.” Willow shut her laptop and stood readily. “Is it something in the hieroglyphs? Should I get Giles too?”

“No,” Buffy said quickly. “It’s more of a – I’m gonna need you to work some mojo.”

“Oh…” Willow’s face fell into a frown.

“Damn it, Will!” the Slayer ranted. “Now is not the time for – for uncertainties. Are you ever gonna make yourself useful to me?”

“Buffy…” Willow said softly. She reached for the Slayer’s hand, but she turned away, refusing to even look at the witch. “I’m sorry,” Willow half-whispered.

“I need people who can help me win this fight,” said Buffy coldly. “Why do you think Spike’s here?”

“I’ll help however I can,” Willow assured her. “I just – I’m sorry,” she said again.

“I get that you’re scared,” Buffy replied. “And you should be. Do you think I like watching you turn into black-eyed baddie? It tears me apart to see that the power is bigger than you are.”

“No,” Willow countered. “Buffy, it’s not like that.” She reached forward to place a hand on the Slayer’s shoulder.

“Damn,” said The First as Willow’s hand passed through the image.

“Oh, that’s nice,” Willow fumed sarcastically, returning to the bed and opening her laptop.

“Don’t you wanna know why I’m here?” The First demanded.

“If you didn’t bring any corporeal friends, I really don’t care,” said Willow, yawning dramatically.

“Don’t you wanna know where Buffy is?”

“Probably killing some of your corporeal friends.”

“Don’t you wanna know who she’s with?” The First offered. “Who she’s snuggling up to? Sating that post-battle itch.”

“I seem to recall a time when you were good at this,” Willow pointed out. “Is that the best you can come up with?”

“She’s with Angel,” said The First, undeterred by the witch’s quips. “Breezed into town in his shining armor. And she’s – thanking him.”

“Yeah?” Willow looked up again. “Well, he could use a good lay,” she reasoned.

“Come on, wicked witch,” The First teased, “tell me you’re not a little bit curious.”

“Guess that’s something you and Angel have in common,” Willow noted. “Not getting any action.”

“I know you’re afraid of me.”

“Witness me tremble.”

“You know she’ll ask for it – the magic,” said The First ominously. “Even her new toy won’t topple my armies and she’ll ask you to be her most powerful weapon. And you’ll cave. All I have to do is wait for an opening and then I’m with you, strawberry.”

“Is it possible that you’ll talk yourself to death?” Willow questioned. “Is that the trick to winning? ‘Cause I could do this all night.”

“You put up a nice front,” The First complimented. “But I think you’re afraid of me.”

“I think you’re afraid of me,” Willow retorted. “Should we go into why that is?”

“By all means, bring the light show,” said The First smugly. “Say your magic words and see if they hurt me. It doesn’t matter how hard you fight me, how many weapons you bring to the battle, I am the only thing that will endure.”

And it disappeared in a blink of light.

“See?” said Buffy, surveying the fallen preacher with distaste. “Under control.”

“Well,” Angel replied, “at least you could tell me you’re glad to see me.”

They walked toward each other and Buffy embraced him warmly, resting her head against his broad chest. Angel looked momentarily disappointed, but corrected his facial expression before Buffy could look up at him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Buffy!” A loud voice called up the stairs. A voice that shouldn’t be in the house.

“Dawn,” Willow exclaimed as the teen burst into the room. “Hi,” offered the witch uncertainly.

“Where’s Buffy?” asked Dawn heatedly.

“Out,” said Willow, shutting her laptop again and standing. “You can wait here if you want.”

“I’ll wait downstairs,” Dawn answered, turning.

“Dawn.” They both held their place, feeling the tension in the room. “I-I’m glad you’re back,” Willow told her quietly.

“Really?” Dawn questioned flatly.

“Really… I – I never got to tell you I’m sorry.”

“Oh,” said Dawn shortly.

“I was – really rude to you this morning – and I’m sorry.”

“I, um, I’m sorry I hurt you,” Dawn returned.

“I…” Willow placed a hand on the teen’s shoulder. “I love you, Dawnie.”

Dawn turned back again and they hugged.

“I love you too,” Dawn assured her before they pulled apart. “And pretending nothing happened in three, two, one,” she continued briskly. “So when’s Buffy getting home?”

“Not sure,” Willow admitted. “And how’d you talk Xander into bringing you back?”

“Um… Well, that was a nice chat,” Dawn decided. “I’m just gonna…” She gestured vaguely toward the door before fleeing from the room.

“Dawn!” Willow called after her.
