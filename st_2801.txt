**********Unforgettable Times : Part-3 ***************************

"Khoaai ! It's khoaai - just see," Papiya and Sonali cried out in exhuberance.

Chandan wasn't there, as I said earlier. So five of us  were walking through the red gravels - for how 
long I don't remember, but fairly long I think. Through Tagore's writings, we knew about "Khoaai", a 
wonderful creation of the nature. The dusts of red gravel ("khoaa") shift from one place to another under
 the influence of wind and river and create some natural undulations in the otherwise plain terrain. It 
was just amazing and I couldn't have visualized it,  had I not seen it with my own eyes.

All of us were feeling tempted to walk further and further down. Our young minds were becoming eager to 
explore the unknown and unseen parts of it. Only problem, if any, was my pair of sandals, which was just a
 few days old. Its raw leather, in contact with my skin had caused a painful blister in one of my toes. It
 was okay and tolerable for the first few days, but the long walk on that day made it worse. I tried not 
to express my feelings of pain, lest it dampens the enjoyment of others and continued to walk with some 
difficulty and at one stage, I was almost limping.

"Swagato, are you okay ?" asked Keka-di. She must have sensed my difficulty.

"Oh yeah, I'll be alright.." I assured.

"It seems you have a pain. You can rest here for sometime, if you feel." she said. Her soft, caring voice 
made me feel warm and nice.

"It's okay, Keka-di . Just a blister, resulting from my new pair of sandals." I had to tell the truth.

"Oh no, don't tell me that ! Give your feet a rest for sometime. Let me see, I may be having some 
antiseptic cream and a band-aid in my handbag." Keka-di was eager to help me.

"Didi always travels with a first-aid box you know," Papiya added.

"It's more of use to others than mine, I think" she said, while searching for her first-aid stuff.

"Here it is. Just apply this ointment and sit for sometime."

"That's so nice of you, Keka-di. But you need not wait for me. Just proceed and I'll catch up with you 
after sometime." I told my companions.

"I think that's good idea. You carry on. I'll stay back here for sometime with Swagato." Keka-di told to 
our other companions. Her suggestion came as a pleasant surprise to me. I was longing for some exclusivity
 with Keka-di and rather unexpectedly, I got it. I never had any exclusive time with any girl/woman 
before.  It was a new and wonderful kind of feeling for me.

"Let me see how bad it is," she told me as the other two girls proceeded with Abhirup. She sat on the 
gravels, just next to me. I was driven crazy by the sweet fragrance of her perfume.

 "Oh no, it must be very painful. The  region around the blister has turned red. Oh no, why didn't you 
tell me that before, Swagato ?"

Keka-di's last sentence carried  a deep sense of warmth and affection, which instantly created a mental 
proximity and feeling of togetherness. I was more than just moved.

"Keka-di, tumi je amaar kachhe roye gele ? Oder saathe gelenaa ?"

I was feeling  sorry that she had to stay back because of me. But, more than that, I was delighted with 
Keka-di's presence beside me.

"Can you guess why I stayed back ?"

"Jaaninaa...." I was unable to guess.

She hold my hands with hers. It gave me a tenderly soft, but warm feeling. As if I was lovingly arrested 
in her prison. She pressed all my fingers together and said,

"I won't release you till you sing a song for me." Keka-di had a strong plea. And now, I knew I have to 
listen to her request.

I looked at Keka-di. With a green saree having designs all over, she was looking amazingly beautiful. 

"Ei udaasee haaoaar pathe pathe mukul guli jhare,
Aami kurhiye niechhi, tomaar charane diyechhi, laho karuno kare."

When I was singing this song, concentrating on the tune and the inner meaning of the lyrics, I felt I 
belonged to a new world, exclusive to me and Keka-di. She was still holding my hands. When my song ended, 
I asked,

"So, aren't you going to release me now ?"

Spontaneously, both of us together threw our arms to each other and tightly embraced. What an intimate 
moment it was ! Neither of us had any plans or preparation for it. Everything was so sudden, so 
spontaneous, so beautiful ! Both of us together forgot the realities and didn't bother to think for a 
moment where our love might lead to. A deep heat of love was flowing through my entire body. The physical 
proximity with Keka-di was making me hard, much harder than what I can imagine now. I was nervous for a 
moment. How am I going to hide my physical arousal ?

"Chhaarbonaa, chhaarbonaa, chhaarbonaa ! Eto sundar gaaner por kichhutei chharbonaa ...."she said, while 
holding me still within her embrace.

"Keka-di, you look so wonderful !" For the first time I expressed my feeling of love for her.

"Oh no, do you know what are you talking ?" she suddenly blushed. She realized the realities and loosened 
her grips on me.

"Naa bole paarchhinaa Keka-di....bhishon....bhaalo laagchhe...." I couldn't complete any sentence. It was 
just some loose collection of words. I was still holding her with my arms. But, an intelligent girl in her
 could instantly understand my expressions of love.

"Why me, Swagato ? Please understand.... I am elder to you. My parents are already planning for my 
marriage. I can force them to keep it aside till my post-graduation, but, not beyond it. You are just a 
first year student. You have a long way to go ..Please understand....a nice, sweet boy you are !" she was 
trying to make me understand with all her softness and affection.

" Keka-di ! The past two days made my world so different. I completely forgot the contradictions of the 
reality. In my mind, I was creating a new world with you" I said.

She again embraced me. There was again a fresh thrust of blood flow in me, swelling my male organ further 
up. I am pretty sure she didn't make a note of it. Thank God !

"Paagol, ekdom paagol---" she said, affectionately.

At that moment, I suddenly a feeling of sadness filled up my mind. My first love proposal was turned down 
and I suddenly felt being ignored. I was almost becoming emotional, but still controlled myself.

"Don't you like me, Keka-di ?" I asked. I knew the question was too childish, but an eighteen year old boy
 has a combination of a child and a man in him. At that very moment, the child in me was more dominant.

She gave me an innocent smile and said, "Tomaake bhaalo na lege paare ? " and continued, "One day, you 
will find a girl, who will shower all her love upon you."

There was a silence for a while. Love was flowing within me, as if forming a homogeneous solution with 
the blood flow within my body. I could listen to the sounds of my own blood flow - literally. It's not a 
writer's imagination. I mean it. I stretched my legs and leaned towards her.

"Maathaa ta ekhaane  raakhte ichchha korchhe bujhi ?" Keka-di asked me, pointing to her laps.

How did she read my mind ? I wondered. While leaning to her, I wished I could place my head on her laps 
and the lover's mind in her understood what I wished. As my head rested on her laps, I felt it was my 
own "Shantiniketan", my own abode of peace. God ! Is there any place in this world, which is more 
comfortable than her laps ? The feeling was just incredible. Difficult to describe. Her lap was 
unbelievably soft and her saree made it silky. There was a combined smell of her perfume, the fabrics of 
her saree and a smell that was her very very own. It is difficult for me to say what was turning me on at 
that moment. Was it the softness ? Was it the smell ? Was it her delicately soft fingers which rested on 
my thighs, or was it everything put together ? I don't know the answer myself.

"Won't you sing another song ?" she asked me, as I smelled her breath.

"Keka-di, now I can sing one song after the other. I won't be tired of singing as long as I am here." I 
said and started the songs.

I sang the same song of last night - the song of spring's touch, which turned into my own song of love. 
One of the best melodies I have ever heard.

"Kichhu palasher neshaa kichhu ba chnapaay meshaa
Taai niye sure sure range rase jaal buni
Rochi mamo phaalguni
Ektuku chhnoya laage ektuku katha shuni"

I was in a mood to sing more. I sang one after the other. I wanted to sing more songs of Tagore since its 
wordings were becoming more and more appealing to me. Then she also requested for Manna Dey's songs, since
 Abhirup disclosed that last evening. Because of my classmates and hall-mates' requests, I happen to sing 
those songs too frequently and almost lost the charms of singing, although I loved those and still I do 
love those songs a lot.

"Hey, they are coming !" Keka-di cautioned me, as I was still resting on her laps. I could see Abhirup, 
Papiya and Sonali walking at a distance. I sat down and she adjusted the upper part of her saree, which 
was modestly wavering with the gentle breeze of the Spring.

"Won't you sing a song for me ?" I asked her.

"Who told you that I can sing ?" she asked.

"I can make out from the singer's voice in you." We were reversing the roles in the conversation that took
 place between us in the first evening.

"I don't have a good stock of Rabindrasangeet like you. I learnt Classical, and I know  only a few Tagore 
songs." she said.

"Then sing..." I pleaded.

"Tomorrow. I promise." she said.

I realized that the next day was Saturday. On Sunday, all of us would leave Shantiniketan. I was reminded 
of the reality. Since our coming here, I belonged to a different world and felt like staying here for ever. 

Abhirup, Papiya and Sonali walked back to us.

"Oh, it was a nice walk Didi. We liked it so much." Papiya told her elder sister. Then she looked at me 
and said, "Oh, you missed it."

"At least I haven't missed much. Rather, all of you missed Swagato's songs." Keka-di replied.

"Oh no, please ....now ....please.....", pleaded Papiya and Sonali. A typical "girlish" plea, as I can 
describe it. All of a sudden, I realized that my importance went up and felt elated. Singing before a 
group and singing in exclusivity requires two different moods. Although, I was in the perfect mood of the 
latter when I was with Keka-di, it was impossible for me to switch the mood suddenly at that point of time.

"Okay, I am not saying no, but we are here for tomorrow. Let's keep it for tomorrow, okay ?" I just 
managed to avoid.

We were about to start our walk back to our respective places.

"Bhule gele cholbe ?"  Keka-di  showed up the band-aid strip to me. Believe me, I had completely forgotten
 about the nasty blister. Before I could help myself, Keka-di stuck the strip on the affected part of my 
toe. I was really embarrassed. She was elder to me afterall !  Did she forget that at that moment ? How 
could she ? She only reminded me of her elderness when I proposed. Or, did she ignore it for the sake of 
love and care ? I don't know the answer myself.


We had yet another round of meeting in the evening. The cultural festival associated with Vasantotsav 
continues for two days. That evening too there was a dance-drama programme and it was heartening to see 
some of the famous personalities of the musical world taking part in the open-air festival. A few folding 
chairs were kept for the aged visitors, but for us, rugs laid out on the grass were good enough. I was 
sitting next to Keka-di. While we were watching the programme and the dusk set in, Keka-di once placed her
 fingers on top of mine. I tangled my fingers with hers. None noticed, as we continued to play with our 
fingers silently for some more time.

A visit to the tea-stall was essential. Just two and a half days back, I didn't know anyone other than 
Abhirup and now there was so much of closeness between all of us. We were chatting with each other, at 
times teasing each other and making fun. Leaving aside my special feelings for Keka-di, I was also 
enjoying the presence of Papiya and Sonali. As if, all six of us became family members in just two days 
time. 

All of us were missing Chandan. When he is there around, he entertains all of us with witty comments and 
sense of humour. And if my guess went right, Sonali was missing Chandan more than any of us. What about 
Papiya - Abhirup ? I thought I would ask Abhirup about it later on.

We all walked together upto Abhirup's grand parental home. Dida told all of us that none  should go out 
anywhere on the next day. All of us would take our lunch together in her place and spend the day with 
them. All of us instantly welcomed the idea. We were not prepared to miss Chandan in this gathering. Dida 
told us that she had already intimated Chandan's parents about it.

*************** 

"Aalo ta jwaalaash na re Abhirup !" 

I preferred the natural moonlight more than the electric bulb in our room. I went within myself. What an 
eventful day for me ! A walk through the khoaai, my painful blister - perhaps a blessing in disguise. And 
then those  loving moments - the close touch of our hands, our spontaneous embrace,  resting on her laps 
and those songs which Tagore had written for us - exclusively for us, as I lovingly imagined.

The day was a bit warmer as compared to the last two days. I wanted to feel fresh with an evening shower.

"...Jetuku kachhete ashe kshaniker phnaake phnaake,
Chakita maner kone swapaner chhobi aake ....."

Within me I was still singing this  song  - the same song of touch, the love song of spring. The 
trickling cold stream of water couldn't take care of my hardness which resulted from my  reminiscence of 
the unforgettable moments of the day. I touched and stroked myself there, gently, slowly. I felt I was 
still resting on her laps. Then imagined the space between her two thighs , a smell of her own which 
drove me wild. I could clearly listen to the sounds of my hot thick jet, which I couldn't keep within me 
anymore.

I felt relaxed. Abhirup and I chatted for a long long time, before finally sleeping. Moonlight was still 
flooding Shantiniketan.
