The following tale was "inspired" by watching a number of films in the
"wip" genre. It involves f/f sex as well as sadism and female/female
combat. Although there are erotic elements in this story, especially in
chap 5 and beyond, I have to admit that the erotic content might not be
full-blooded enough for many and I make no apologies for this.</small></small></small><br>

<h1><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">LISA'S
STORY&nbsp; - PART ONE - PRISON CATFIGHT</span></h1>
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"><br>
Lisa kissed Samantha goodbye and there were tears in both girls' eyes.
Last night they had made love for the last time and now was the final
physical contact for many weeks. She held her tight for several minutes
until both young women realised
that the time had come and they parted with one last quick but tender
kiss. This was the sad part about what was otherwise to be a very happy
day. Samantha and Lisa had been best friends for three years, not that
they had seen too much of each other during that time, but the last few
months had been very precious for both girls and they were to meet
again as soon as Samantha was released and could make the journey to
Wales where Lisa was headed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;She went to be given back her own clothes,
taken from her thirty eight months ago in exchange for prison uniform,
and dressed. The touch of them on her skin felt odd after all this
time. She noticed that her shoes, once so comfortable, were now&nbsp;
too tight. Well, that was hardly surprising, since she had been
barefoot for all but three days of her time here and her feet had
probably grown a little. She determined to buy a new pair as soon as
she got home. </span><br

<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">The gate guard
shook hands with her before letting her through. She had already shaken
hands with governor, the only male in the establishment and a hidebound
bureaucrat if ever there was one, though with flashes of humanity now
and again. She had bid farewell to the hatchet faced chief warder who
had lusted after her from the first but had nevertheless dutifully kept
her hands to
herself&nbsp; - except for her frequent and painful punishments!&nbsp;
She took one
last look at the low level building under which she had passed much of
her sentence and walked through the gate into the waiting car, which
took her straight to the airport and back to her old life. Lisa knew
she would be missed by many, for she had become a very popular girl in
the last few months. But it had not always been thus.</span><br

<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Lisa's troubles
had started the first day she had been in this Asian country on a two
week holiday. She knew it was a case of mistaken identity and so did
her parents, her lawyer and all who knew her. Lisa was incapable of
criminal acts and, with a rich and very generous father, had no need to
steal. Unfortunately she had come here alone, as the first great
adventure of her life. Her parents had been worried, but her father had
never been able to say no to his winsome blonde daughter and here she
was. Her arrest had come as a total shock and she had made use of her
one and only phone call to contact Daddy. Daddy, alas, had been away
and it was weeks before he heard of his daughter's plight. She knew it
was all a mistake, but the judge had not seen it her way and, three
years ago to the day, a leggy slim blonde had been deposited at this
prison to begin a three year sentence for theft.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Samantha had
taken to her right away and the two had immediately bonded. Lisa had
the vacant bed next to Samantha. On Lisa's first full day she had been
sent to work in the kitchen in the morning and in the grounds in the
afternoon. It was August and very hot, but Lisa had enjoyed being in
the open, after the steamy heat of the kitchen.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Lisa had
noticed something odd during the day and asked Samantha about it as
they were being marched back to their cells. "Why do some of the women
not wear shoes, Samantha? It can't be for comfort. Some of those stones
are sharp as razors!"&nbsp; She had seen several inmates in this state,
as they toiled among the sharp flints in the garden.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Samantha looked
at the women in question and her face lost its smile for a second.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">"Because those
women have all been punished at some time, Lisa, by being sent to
solitary confinement. While they are in they are made to undress
completely and when they come out of solitary they get their clothes
back, minus their footwear. They must remain barefoot for the rest of
their sentence. It gives them a bit of status, being marked out as
graduates of the isolation block but it's a hard won status, Lisa!
Their feet toughen up in time, of course. Some of them have been like
that for years now and would probably reject shoes even if they had the
chance to wear them, but they go through hell in solitary. I have
nightmares about it! Never get sent there, Lisa!"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">"But it can't
be that bad! I mean, surely it's just a matter of being on your own.
Once you get used to being confined you just buckle down to getting
through your time there. It can't be that terrible."</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">"It's not just
being locked up, Lisa. It's a very strict regime. You get nothing to
read and nobody to talk to. And the cells are so small. They make sure
you suffer every second of the time you're in there. They have loads
and loads of rules and if you break one you get extra time. If you go
back a second time, you lose more clothes when you get out. We had one
topless prisoner, but she was released the week before you came. But I
don't know of anyone else who went back for more. When a girl gets back
after eight weeks in solitary - and that's if she's lucky and manages
not to break any rules -&nbsp; she takes months to recover and she's
determined never to get sent back. Some of them never do get over it,
poor things. I don't know exactly everyting they do to the segregated
prisoners, because they don't like to talk about it once they get out,
but believe me, it isn't nice!"</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">"You mean they
can go in there for as long as eight weeks?" Lisa, the archetypical
open air girl, was shocked to think of anyone being away from the
daylight and fresh air for that long.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">"That's the
standard time. No one ever gets less. For a second offence you'd get
eight weeks plus another eight and they make you serve your first eight
all over again before you even start your second stint. It can really
mount up at a frightening rate if you keep going back there!&nbsp; And
a third offence would get you twenty four plus a repeat of all the time
already done. But only one or maybe two girls have ever got more than
one stretch and they didn't get sent down deliberately - believe you
me!"</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Lisa looked
around. Out of two hundred or so women she could see, only twelve were
barefoot. Andit was plain what Samantha had meant about some not
getting over it. Most of these former solitary inmates looked fine
except for their lack of shoes, but three were clearly nervous wrecks
and in a pitiable condition. Probably claustrophobic, she decided, and
the experience had permanently unhinged them. What a cruel place the
world could be! But there were only a dozen out of two hundred, so it
couldn't be that easy to get sent there. As long as she was careful to
do as she was told, she would keep her shoes for the next three years
and stay in the fresh air!</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">And then the
first disaster struck, in the form of an older and more well-built girl
who jostled Lisa just as they were entering the prison building. It was
probably only an accident but Lisa made the mistake of looking round
and glaring. This provoked the woman to push her again.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Lisa had led a
sheltered life up to this point, but she remembered what her father had
once told her elder brother before the lad was sent away to school.
She, herself,&nbsp; had been educated at a day school and come home
every night to a doting father and mother.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">"Never let
yourself be pushed around, son" her father had said. Lisa decided that
this advice might be said to apply to her in her present situation! She
pushed back and was then sent flying. She picked herself up and was
punched in the face. What was it that her father had also said?</span><br
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">"Always hit
back, son. Never mind if you take a beating, always hit back. It's the
only way!."</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Deciding that
prison was not unlike boarding school and that what applied to boys
could also apply to girls, the delicate faced blonde Lisa hit back. The
other girl, who was no taller, but much heavier, hit her a second time,
only a
lot harder! Lisa licked her cut lip and tasted blood. She hit the other
girl again, putting more weight behind this punch. Soon the air was
full of the sounds of&nbsp; fists crashing into faces and thudding into
bodies as the two stood toe to toe and slugged it out like there was no
tomorrow. The other girls were crowding around to get a view of the
fight, which was, to put it mildly, not going Lisa's way! Lisa knew
that she was being well and truly thumped but refused to back down and
was surprising herself by getting in a few good shots as she gained
confidence. Her anger at being picked on overcame any fear she might
have had. Then the staff came running up and the pair were separated,
breathing heavily and, in Lisa's case, bleeding profusely.</span><br
