Beating the woo out of her - copyright 2012


"I sense there's something wrong with you," she said, "I can see it in your aura."

I looked up with a frown at the person who'd sat down next to me, frankly stunned speechless by the unexpected intrusion and inanity of the statement. After all I was sitting all by myself in a caf with my head in my hands, deducing there was something troubling me hardly required the imaginary ability to detect auras. When I realized this was actually my date, I failed to get more impressed.

"There's no such thing as an aura," I replied angrily, "and the only thing wrong with me is that my date is 45 minutes late without giving me a heads up." Now admittedly that's not the best sentence I've opened a date with, but at this point I didn't think this was going anywhere anyway. When her excuse for being late was that "she didn't subscribe to the materialistic idea of punctuality", that "everything is relative anyway", and that "it all balances out in the end" it didn't exactly change my mood. But then she changed the subject to what had brought us to this date in the first place, namely kinky sex, by saying "I know I've been a bad girl, so I guess you'll have to punish me." Did I need for her to agree with my world view to strip her, tie her up and mark her skin? No, not really, so from there the date went well for a while, until she came back to the aura thing again. "You really do have some imbalances in your aura," she said, purposefully waving her hands over my forarms and palms, "I can feel the energies flowing wrong. Would you let me correct them?"

Now I won't bore you with the resulting conversation about "energies", "empirical evidence", "opinion vs. fact" and "The Emily Rosa experiment". Suffice to say that the evening was only saved when we somehow got started on a plan to combine an aura detection test with BDSM and agreed to meet up again to do the experiment.

A few days later she was in my "dungeon" (some day I'm going to have a secluded house with an astronomy tower and a real dungeon with proper stone walls instead of of a multipurpose room with uncomfortably poor soundproofing) and prepped for the session. Upper arms tied to her torso, some home made and minimal wrist guards keeping her wrists straight, and arms kept horizontal by straps going from mid forearm to mid upper arm. Movement was further restricted by a rope between her waist cincher and the wall behind her.

"Let's go over this again," I said. "I'm going to hold my right hand, the one you've determined has the most powerful energies, underneath one of your outstretched hands, and you're going to indicate which hand it is by clearly leaning your head in that direction."
"Yes."
"*ahem*"
"Yes, Master."

I'm generally not a fan of the 'master' title, but for this session it stands for Master of Science. Yeah, I'm a science geek. Deal with it.

"Unblinded you claimed a 95% score, but to give you a sporting chance we're only aiming for 75% in this experiment. We're doing 24 trials. So if you score 18 hits, you win. There's just over 1% chance you'll do that just by chance, so in that case we'll do another run in a week with 48 trials. And if you pass that I'll admit you really do feel auras and I'll take a compass and carve 'fancy that' on the side of my cock."

I don't know why I kept making that obscure penis mutilation reference when I knew she didn't get it. No, I do know. I got a kick out of it. Also, I was taping this and figured some of the viewers would like it.

"Now I don't expect you to pass either test, and each time you miss you'll get punished. Each time you miss and the running total is below 75% the punishment gets more severe. Every hit that puts the total to 75% or more resets the severity. Agreed?"

"Yes, Master!"

"Now before you get blindfolded we'll run another check, just so you can tell me if your ability is influenced by the situation. Can you feel this?"

"Yes, Master!"

"And this?"

"Yes, Master!"

I put on her the best blindfold I had and made sure it was secure and had no gaps and then gagged her.

"Let's try again, just so you don't decide halfway through that the blindfold interferes with your ability. My hand is now under your right hand. Can you feel the aura?"

*nod*

"And now it's under the left. No problems discerning which hand receives the energy?"

*shake*

Suddenly I got an attack of ethics. I was using this woman's mistaken but sincerely held beliefs so I could torture her. Now admittedly she liked being tortured, but I still had to give her another chance to see she was wrong.

"I'll run one set of four first, so you can see how it goes before we start for real. Which hand?"

She tilted her head to the left.

"Correct." I flipped a coin to make the selection randomly (on the computer, to save time). "And now?"

Again to the left.

"Wrong." She next got one wrong and one right. "That's 50%. Are you still confident?"

*nod*

My conscience assuaged I licked my lips and started the first trial. Computer said left.

"Which side?"

She tilted her head to the right.

"Sorry, wrong." I smacked her bare butt with my hand. "Next will be with a ruler. Which side?"

*left*

"Correct." I brushed her butt with the ruler. "Which side?"

*left*

"Correct again, maybe I'm wrong?" No, I wasn't actually thinking that, but why not keep her confidence up? "Which side?"

*left*

"Correct again. That's 75%. The ruler is off." Stupid statistics ruining my fun. "Which side?"

*left*

"Correct again. Hmf. Which side?" I was getting a bit impatient.

*right*

"Correct!" I have to admit I was getting a bit spooked at this point. "Which side?"

*right*

I didn't even bother telling her she was right, just asked the computer where to place my hand and asked, "Which side?"

*left*

"Wrong!" That only brought us back to 75% hits though, so I didn't feel confident yet. 1% chances do tend to crop up once every 100 or so experiment. I smacked the other cheek this time, trying to leave a nice clean hand impression. It also occurred to me that a 48 trial experiment would mean a lot more misses in total. "Which side?"

*left*

"Correct. Which side?"

*right*

"Correct!" I nearly started rooting for the long shot at this point. "Which side?"

*left*

"Wrong." I smacked her butt hurridly. And you're back below 75% again. Which side?"

*right*

"Correct, and I hate to admit it, but that puts you at 75%. Which side?"

*right*

"Wrong." Another slap with little finesse.

*right*

"Correct. Which side?"

*left*

"Correct." The number of trials was more on my side now. Even with the two latest hits she was only at 73%. Of course, another run like the initial trials and she'd win, but then I got to do the bigger experiment. "Which side?"

*left*

"Wrong." I smacked her butt again. "Next time with the ruler. Which side?"

*right*

"Correct, but you're still below 75%. Which side?"

*right*

"Wrong." Finally I got to use my ruler. I did a couple of practice swings to listen to the swish and then let her have it across both butt cheeks. "Next time I'm moving to your tits. Which side?"

*right*

"Correct. Which side?"

*right*

"Wrong!" The flat of my hand made a nice sound as I slapped the side of her left breast. "Next time it's the ruler again. Which side?"

*left*

"Wrong!" I gently caressed her breasts with the ruler, enjoying her flinch at the first touch so much I made another couple of false swings before landing one across the top of both breasts raising a nice red welt. "Only three more trials, but the next punishment is for your pussy. Which side?"

*left*

"Correct. But I still get to smack your pussy if you miss. Which side?"

*left*

"Correct again. You're at 65%, so you have no chance of winning. But there's still one more chance of getting your pussy smacked. Which side?"

*left*

"Dammit! Correct. No smacking your pussy then." I placed my hand there gently instead. It was fairly wet...

The rest of the session isn't relevant to the experiment, but unsurprisingly once we were done and sat down to relax and cool off, the standard excuses came out. "Maybe I got fatigued or subconsciously wanted to lose? I mean, I did much better in the beginning, and then I did want some attention. And when I really didn't want my pussy smacked I had another run of three. See?" She pointed at the spreadsheet still visible on my computer and I barely managed to refrain from groaning. "Can we do the 48 trial run anyway, only with long breaks between each trial and no mild punishment? Then I won't be tired and I'll be top motivated each time." I considered explaining how unscientific her post experiment examination and rationalisation of the data was, but hey, she did grasp that these were just suggestions that required testing, and it did sound like a nice session, so I nodded and said, "Sure, Sweety. Whatever it takes to beat the woo out of you."
