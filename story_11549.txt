From the pen of Bertram W. Wooster: In which an exchange is made.

Chapter 7: Stolen Goods

The odious Roberson seemed content to keep me tied to that chair until Judgement Day, when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him. (I remember that bit from school, where I won the Scripture Knowledge Prize. And let me tell you that although I don't usually go in for that kind of thing, the more hours I spent trapped in Roberson's rooms, the more appealing the idea of divine judgment against the wicked became, for Roberson was a grade-A sinner if ever I saw one.)

The woman, Ettie, came in a few times, bearing food of which I was allowed to have none. After the second time this happened, my stomach began to growl and moan and generally make a fuss. I wished I could follow my stomach's example, and raise every sort of racket, but I dared not while Roberson was in the room. The heavy curtains remained closed, so I had no sense of time beyond what the thin sliver of light that cut between the gap in the fabric could give me. Its presence signalled that day had come, and some time later its absence marked that night had again fallen. Twice during that time I was allowed a chaperoned visit to lav. Around evening, I was freed again for a few minutes in which I was allowed a magnificent drink of water-the best water I can ever recall drinking, so desperate was I for a drop to wet my throat.

The next day, Roberson left the rooms for a time and Ettie was set to watch over me. This seemed a lucky turn of events, for I'd always had some luck winning the hearts of fillies, whether I wanted to or not in many circs. I thought that Ettie might be swayed by pity for my plight.

"Excuse me," I paused, confused on what to call her before I settled on, "ma'am. But I don't suppose a fellow could get a spot of whisky and s., could he?" I decided to start small, rather than immediately jump to, "Be a good sport and let me go, what?" I didn't want to make my move too quickly. Girls tend to get offended when you do that, or so my friend Bingo assures me.

"And what have you done to deserve a whisky, love?"

I blinked in befuddlement, but at least she hadn't given me an outright rejection. "Am I supposed to do something?"

"That depends on you. Do you want a drink?"

"Well, yes," I replied.

She shrugged one shoulder-QED in gesture form. I pondered what I was supposed to do to earn a drink, but nothing came to mind. I then remembered that I was supposed to be convincing her to do things for me, not the other way around. I wondered what Jeeves would do if he were here, and concluded that he'd come up with some corking plan to turn this state of affairs to his advantage. The trick was to think like Jeeves.

First, I imagined myself as Jeeves-like as I could. In my mind's eye, I put myself in Jeeves's clothes, his pinstriped trousers, his bowler hat, which sunk down over my eyes until I shrunk it a bit, and his black morning coat. I looked quite dashing, I thought to myself, although not as dashing as Jeeves. This led me to wonder what Jeeves was wearing, if I was wearing his suit. The thought of Jeeves in naught but his underclothes made my face burn with a rosy blush, but I was sure that he'd never allow himself to be seen in such a state of dishabille. Therefore, to save him from embarrassment, I put him in one of my suits, the respectable beige tweed and, in a fit of mischief, the purple tie that he'd "lost" last week. He looked not at all pleased with me, but it was my imagination, dash it all!

In my mind, I said to him, "Now, I'm you and you're me."

Jeeves-in-my-mind looked dubious. "If you say so, sir."

"Now, I am-that is to say you are-tied up. Kidnapped."

"Whatever shall I do, sir?"

"Exactly. Whatever shall you-that is to say I-do."

"My first priority would be to endeavour to undo the knots that tether me, sir."

"They're dashed tight knots, Jeeves. There's no undoing them by myself. That is to say, yourself."

"Then, sir, it would seem that assistance is required."

"Just my thought exactly, Jeeves! I even have an accomplice in mind. There's a woman who works with the fellow who kidnapped me. I could exert my wiles upon her."

Jeeves-in-my-mind raised a doubtful eyebrow one-quarter of an inch. "I could not recommend it, sir."

"Well then what the blazes can I do? Or rather, you do."

"You ought-that is to say, I ought-to be patient and allow my valet to take care of the situation rather than haring off on a plan that will only complicate matters further, sir."

"Well!" I huffed. "Some use you are! You are dismissed, Jeeves. Go read your Spinoza or whomever."

The Jeeves-in-my-mind inclined his head and departed. I felt lonely without him and wondered if I'd been hasty in sending him away, but it was too late now. I'd just have to think up a corking plan on my own. I let the little grey cells ponder the problem for a few moments, and at last a thought came to me, so sudden and bright that I suspected that the Jeeves-in-my-head had left it behind when he biffed off and I'd just stumbled upon it.

"Eureka!" I cried out, for that's what one cries out when one comes upon something splendid. I must have said it aloud, for Ettie gave me a queer look. "For me to do whatever it is I'm supposed to do to earn a drink, you'll have to untie me." My logic was impeccable. She would have to yield before it.

Said yielding was slow to happen. Instead of rushing to release my bonds, she merely stood where she was, one hip cocked and her red-painted lips curled in amusement. "Oh, I wouldn't be so sure of that if I was you."

My face crinkled in puzzlement and I bowed my head in thought, able to make neither heads nor tails of her riddles. She had side-stepped my impeccable logic by being completely irrational. "Tied up, the only thing I can do is sit here. If that were all it took to get a drink, I'd be woozled by now."

She laughed. "You are an innocent, ain't you? Poor dear. Marcus'll eat you up and spit you out."

"I do hope you don't mean that literally." I didn't think Roberson went in for cannibalism, not really, but given all the other crimes he had committed, and given what a bad egg he was all around, I couldn't be too careful. She only laughed again. It was a strange sort of beazel who found cannibalism funny. Clearly, she was as cracked and depraved as Roberson.

"Don't you look so down in the dumps, hey?" she said. "Marcus hasn't killed you yet, and that means he don't plan to. He's got another use for you. Ransom, I'd bet, from your fine clothes and your fancy speech. Your wife will pay up to get her handsome lad back, and the two of you will leave none the worse off except for being a bit lighter in the pocketbook."

"That's all very well, except for the fact that I'm not married."

"Really now?"

"Yes, really."

"You're rich, easy enough on the eyes, less of a swine than most men, and you say you ain't married? You must be either a loony or a nancy."

"I say!"

"Sorry to offend you, love," she said, looking not the least bit sorry at all. "I just tell it how I see it."

"Anyway, it's not like that at all," I said. "This Roberson chap's not interested in me or my family or my money; it's all about Holmes. You've heard of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, haven't you? The world's only private consulting detective and all that? Well, by a strange and remarkable twist of fate, the famous Mr. Holmes ended up on my doorstep and in my flat. Roberson's after him-some sort of vendetta like Captain Whosits and the white whale-and I just had the bally misfortune to get in the way. Now I'm stuck here tied to this chair, which is not a terribly comfortable chair, mind you, especially not after countless hours of constant companionship with it, until Holmes gets these Jewels of Tarpon. No, that can't be right. A tarpon's a fish; I remember Jeeves telling me that. I would be dashed silly to have jewels named after a fish. Anyway, he's supposed to steal these Jewels of Whatever and give them to Roberson. Quid pro quo Roberson will then give me to Holmes, then he can take me back to Jeeves where I belong."

At some point during my little explanation, Ettie had paled. Her painted lips were the only colour on her face. "Sherlock Holmes, you said?"

"The very same."

Her reaction was swift. She paced about the room wringing her hands and muttering to herself. At last, she whirled on me. "Marcus trades you for these jewels and then everyone goes their separate ways, yes? Everything's done?"

"Yes. As far as I know."

"Good. That's good. Just plain business and nothing more." She said nothing else to me and ignored all my further attempts to gain her good will.

It was dark again by the time Roberson came back. He had four ruffians with him, big, brutish chaps who looked like they went by names like "Big Eddie" and "Baby-face Al." They were all armed.

Roberson untied me from the chair. As he did so, he hissed, "If you try to escape or otherwise cause us any trouble, you will regret it. Understood?"

"Of course I understand. What kind of idiot do you think I am?"

Roberson and his cronies laughed. "I know just what sort of idiot you are," Roberson said. "Lucky for you, it's the useful kind." He dragged me to my feet and bound my wrists together before prodding me out the door. Outside, there was an empty cab waiting. One of Roberson's thugs got behind the wheel, and all the rest of us piled in. I was crammed in the back seat with the three others tight as sardines in a can. I couldn't move well enough to affect an escape, even if I'd possessed the nerve to try. We drove a long ways, but between the darkness and the massive bodies separating me from the windows, I couldn't see where we were going. My first and only clue of my whereabouts arrived when I got a whiff of tar, rotten fish, and other even more malodorous things...if malodorous is the word I want. Yes, I think it is.

A few minutes after this first assault on my nose, we reached our destination. As my nostrils suspected, we were at the docks. Roberson unlocked a nearby door and shuffled us down into one of the wine vaults, a dark, gloomy sort of place, like a catacomb. How he got a key I couldn't fathom until the current of my thoughts carried a scrap of knowledge to me, like flotsam on the river. I remembered Holmes telling me of Roberson, that his family was in the shipping business. This dank cellar must have been one of his.

There was no electricity laid down in the vault, and the sole lamp barely illuminated more than ten feet. The room might have gone on forever as far as I could tell. Casks, hogsheads, and barrels lay piled one atop the other in rows that stretched out like a labyrinth until they vanished in the shadows.

Roberson grinned at me. "For the love of God, Montresor."

I wrinkled my nose in confusion. "My name is Wooster." I reminded him. "Bertram Wooster. One would think you could at least remember the names of the poor devils you've kidnapped."

"It's Poe, you nitwit."

"No, it's Wooster. I'm bally sure I know my own name."

"Edgar Allen Poe, the author," Roberson snarled. "From 'The Cask of Amontillado.' I could bury you alive in here and no one would ever find you."

Well, there wasn't much a chap could say in reply to that, and so I was silent as Roberson sat me down on one of the casks and his four accomplices stepped out of the circle of light cast by the lamp and disappeared.

"And now we wait," Roberson said.

No one spoke or moved. Here, deep in the wine vault, it was as if the outside world and all its noises of life had ceased to exist. The silence was too unnerving for me. "You know, I'd never realized what an uncomfortable position sitting upright really is before being forced into that position and no other for Lord knows how many hours."

"We wait quietly."

"It's just that it's a bit too quiet, if you know what I mean. Really chills a man's soul, this quiet-as-nuns-in-a-library sort of quiet."

Roberson cocked his revolver and aimed it at me. "It would be a lot quieter if you were dead."

I quailed looking down the barrel of a gun. "Sorry," I whispered. "I'll be quieter. You won't hear another word out of me, I give you my word as a Wooster, and a Wooster's word is-" Before I could finish telling him about the value of the promise of a Wooster, he raised his pistol and brought it down upon my head. My vision narrowed and the encroaching darkness became absolute.

When next I cracked open my eyes, I had a splitting headache and my stomach was feeling none too pleased with itself either. It felt like the morning after a particularly corking night at the Drones club, only without any of the spotty memories of soused enjoyment to make up for the present misery, and no Jeeves on hand with his amazing restorative. There were voices speaking; squinting in their direction, I recognized Holmes's lanky frame silhouetted by the open doorway. Watson lurked just beyond the threshold, against the wall and half-covered by the doorframe. I looked around for Jeeves, and saw him at last, his dark suit rendering him almost invisible in the black stairwell. My heart rose at the sight of him, for so long as he was near, I knew I was safe.

Roberson was speaking. "I hardly need to tell you that I have friends nearby. I'm sure you've already deduced it. Any false move and they will fire." He sounded strangely friendly about the whole thing, as if announcing potential murder were on par with telling a drinking pal about the odds at the Royal Ascot.

"I expected as much," Holmes replied. "Let us finish this quickly."

"Ah, good old gloomy Mr. Holmes, all business and no pleasure. Are you sure you wouldn't care for a drink first?" Roberson waved an arm at his surroundings. "As you can see, there's plenty to go around."

"I think not."

"I suppose it can't quite compare to your favourite vices. Very well, although you can't say that I didn't try to be a good host. Now, let me see the jewels."

Holmes unlatched the satchel he carried and pulled out an impressive pile of gold. He twisted it around his hand, encouraging the black gems to catch the light like still waters reflecting the moon. He poured the thing back into the satchel then and placed it at his feet.

"Well done, Mr. Holmes, very well done. Your caper will be the envy of every cat burglar in London." Roberson clapped his hands. "You take to crime so naturally, or perhaps I should say unnaturally, given your preferred illegal activity. Little crimes, big crimes, it's a wonder that people call you an ally of the law. You've blinded the world to your hypocrisy quite effectively. Not even the late Moriarty had such an impenetrable cover."

Holmes's expression did not change. My years with Jeeves have made me adept at reading even subtle shifts of mood, but Holmes may as well have been a corpse for all the life in his face. "There are the jewels. Now release Mr. Wooster."

Seizing my arm, Roberson yanked me to my feet, the sudden change in elevation a matter of great distress to my already moody stomach. Had I been allowed any food during my imprisonment, I'm sure that it would have made a reappearance right then and there.

"Here is your Mr. Wooster, safe and sound, just as I promised." Roberson pushed me and I staggered forward, nearly toppling head-over-heels, until a strong hand, which was neither Roberson's nor Holmes's, steadied me. Roberson, ignoring my near collapse, continued speaking to Holmes. "You've gone to quite a lot of effort in order to retrieve the boy. I do hope Dr. Watson isn't the jealous type."

"Your insinuation is tasteless and absurd," Holmes replied.

I, meanwhile, let my gaze trail up past the previously mentioned saviour's strong hand, to black clad sleeve, to broad shoulder, to chiselled jaw and brilliantined head. I leaned heavily against Jeeves's arm��"for that was the identity of my saviour��"and blinked up at his much missed visage, wishing that my vision would stop spinning so I could get a good proper look like I wanted. In retrospect, I imagine that we looked much like the covers of a romantic novel, the ones that feature some toothsome filly swooning in the arms of a handsome man, the two gazing adoringly in each others eyes. Jeeves, of course, didn't look even a quarter as soppy as your traditional romantic hero, but there was a certain...thingness in his expression that made the Wooster lungs breathless and did nothing to improve my dizzy spell. My whole world was whirling about and I clung to Jeeves, who was the only point of solidity. For the first time, I felt some degree of hope that the tender feelings that had arisen in me over these many years might not be entirely unwelcome and unreciprocated.

"Are you injured, sir?"

"Bit of a knock on the head, is all. I've had worse. I could really go for one of your cocktails and a nice cigarette, though, and when I get home I'll want an entire five course meal. I've been hungry for...how long has it been since I was snatched up?"

"Two days."

"Two days? Good Lord, you mean to tell me that I haven't eaten in two days? Well, no wonder the midsection is feeling a bit hollow. Two days." As Jeeves manoeuvred me towards the exit, Holmes and Roberson continued to exchange hostile words.

"I may call upon your services again, of course," Roberson said. "Since I still have your dear doctor's manuscript in my possession, you would do well to obey my little requests."

Holmes smiled a tight, vicious, little smile. "Many men have threatened me, craftier, stronger men than you. I am still here. They are not."

"But it is not you alone I am threatening."

"That is your worst mistake of all." Holmes turned his back to Roberson then, not fearing that he would receive a bullet in it. Watson standing guard at the doorway with his revolver out may have had something to do with Holmes's fearlessness.

Jeeves escorted me out of that dark hole, but before Holmes could close the door behind us, Roberson called out, "I'll have you broken and begging before I'm done. I promise you that."

Then we were up the staircase and out onto the street. Dr. Watson noticed my weakness, and gave me a quick examination under the light of a streetlamp. He declared a "minor concussion, but nothing life-threatening" and ordered me to inform him immediately if my symptoms got worse instead of better. Heartened by his diagnosis, I tried to walk unsupported for a few steps but was so wobbly that a passer-by might have mistaken me for a nattily dressed drunken sailor on shore leave. Within half a second, Jeeves had my arm draped around his shoulders and his hand at my waist, holding me against his side.

"I shall take you home forthwith, sir."

"Jolly good. Home, sweet home. That's what some fellow said, and what a spot of insight it is. Whoever came up with it must be truly one of the great thinkers of history, right up there with such luminaries as Socrates and Thomas Aquinas."

"I believe you are referring to the American dramatist John Howard Payne, who wrote the words approximately one hundred years ago as part of his opera Clari, Maid of Milan."

"John Howard Payne. I've never heard of him. Are you sure it wasn't Socrates, or your chap Spinoza or someone like that?"

"Quite sure, sir."

"Oh."

Things were already returning to normal. Jeeves was with me, his marvellous brain overflowing with knowledge of every sort, and the two days spent in Roberson's capture were relegated to the unhappy past. The only out-of-the-ordinary thing that remained, aside from my wrinkled clothes and empty stomach, was the presence of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I didn't dare meet Holmes's eye for fear that he would learn that Roberson had betrayed his personal affairs to me. Holmes clearly did not want the nature of his relationship with Dr. Watson known to all and sundry, for obvious practical and legal reasons. He would probably be distressed to find that I knew. The only gentlemanly thing, therefore, was to act as though I knew nothing.

As we walked down the street��"well, they walked, I staggered��"looking for a cab, I spoke to them. "I know it's a bit late for supper, but I'd be happy to put on the nosebag with you if you've a mind to, or share a drink or two if you've already eaten."

Watson replied. "We would be happy to." I thought that this "we" might have been a bit optimistic, as Holmes didn't look happy at all, but as he did not protest, I was willing to accept it at face value.

"And you must fill me in on what happened before you toddle off to wherever. I've spent the last two days kidnapped and haven't the faintest clue what went on in the outside world. That is to say, it would be a rummy thing to just be ransomed off with the Jewels of Tarpon or whatever and then sent about my merry way without a few explanations. What kind of story would that make for my grandchildren? Not that I have plans to have grandchildren, but if I were to have grandchildren, it would make a right disappointing story for them. 'What ho, young Woosters. When I was a lad, I was involved in an adventure with the famous Sherlock Holmes. I don't rightly know what exactly the adventure was or how it was resolved, since I spent the whole bally time tied to a chair, but there was an adventure.' "

"I'm sure Watson would be more than happy to oblige," Holmes said. "He adores weaving tales. Just don't expect the result to be entirely accurate."

Watson shook his head in resignation. Minutes later we found a cab at last. Once we arrived back at my flat, I took myself away to freshen up a bit, for after two difficult days my clothes were not fit for polite company. Jeeves, meanwhile, cooked up a quick and simple meal.

We ate in relative silence. Or rather, I ate, and ate voraciously, my mouth too full to engage in conversation. Jeeves and Watson had dined earlier and did not partake. Watson endeavoured to persuade Holmes to eat, for evidently he, too, had scarcely eaten in the last two days. He met with little success on that front, although he did convince Holmes to partake of a few bites. When supper was done, I felt much invigorated; my headache was fading and my stomach settling down into quiet contentment. We retired to the sitting room where Watson regaled me with the tale of my missing two days��"the phone call, the burglary, and the plans made for my safe retrieval��"with Holmes interjecting to make occasional corrections. I was awed and humbled by the effort that had been put forth for my benefit.

The hour, already late when we arrived at my flat, grew later still. After my third glass, Jeeves coughed politely to remind me of the time, and said, "Perhaps I should arrange a cab for Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson so that they may return to their hotel."

I started and looked at the clock. "Oh. Yes, I suppose you're right. It is getting late and we all need our shut-eye."

Watson rose to his feet but Holmes remained seated and spoke up. "If we might take advantage of your hospitality, Mr. Wooster, it would be both more convenient and safer for us to room here. A hotel is a frightfully insecure place from which to plan an attack. Were Roberson to discover in which hotel we were staying-and I've no doubt he could-it would be simplicity itself for him to infiltrate our hotel room. Whereas here we can be on guard, tell the doorman to refuse him admittance if he should call, and keep the doors locked and bolted against him. The flat is far from impenetrable, but it is still a good deal more secure than a hotel."

I was ready to acquiesce on the spot, but Jeeves said, "If I may suggest, sir, that it would be safer for Mr. Wooster if he were not involved any further in this affair."

"He's already involved. Roberson knows his name, where he lives, and that he has a connection to me. No, Mr. Wooster is most certainly involved."

"Well, that settles it," I said. "You saved this Wooster's bacon tonight, and it would be churlish of me to fail to return the favour as best I can. This Roberson devil is still out there and we would all be better off if we stuck together. Safety in numbers and all that. Besides, if you and Jeeves could learn to use your great minds in unison, well, with two geniuses at work against him, Roberson would be sure to fall. What do you think, Jeeves?"

Jeeves had that stuffed-frog look that meant that he wanted to say something that was not entirely in the feudal spirit. I motioned him aside and we retreated to the far corner of the room away from Holmes and Watson. "All right, spit it out, Jeeves."

"I think it would be inadvisable for you to pursue such a potentially dangerous course of action, sir. Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson's problems are not ours."

"But you're always willing to help out my other friends with their troubles and vexations."

"Your friends were never in predicaments that threatened your very life."

"I don't know about that. Roderick Spode in a high dudgeon is a fearsome thing indeed."

"Sir, Lord Sidcup's threats against you, however heartfelt, are not as alarming as the prospect of you challenging a known murderer."

"Jeeves, under normal circs, no chap loves the uncomplicated life more than yours truly. Indeed, I've had quite enough excitement for one week, and would happily return to the days when my most pressing problem is whether to wear the grey tie or the blue. Yet, a Wooster never abandons a true friend in need, and so, danger or not, I insist on lending aid."

"With due respect, sir, you have known these gentlemen for two days, during most of which you were imprisoned by a ruthless criminal."

"I'm surprised at you, Jeeves. Duration of time does not true friendship make. For example, I've know Gussie Fink-Nottle since my old Eton days, yet I could hardly call him a bosom friend. Whereas you, Jeeves, I have known for only a few years, and yet I-" I broke off, aware that I was about to reveal a bit more than I intended to. I cleared my throat and returned to the topic in question, namely, the loyalty I owed to Holmes and Watson. "Besides, they committed burglary for me, and it's not just anyone who does that. Usually I'm the one who's forced to play the light-fingered cad on behalf of others. In fact, the only other person I can think of who has done similar on my behalf-risking life and limb, flouting the law-is, well, you, Jeeves."

"Sir-"

"No, Jeeves. My mind is made up. Chez Wooster will be base of operations." I sidled up to Jeeves even closer and whispered to him, "Besides, you can't tell me that you don't want to get back at that devil for wreaking havoc in our life. The man kidnapped me, for goodness' sake. He held a gun to my head. One can't just let something like that slide."

Jeeves' eyes darkened. "The idea of retribution does hold some appeal, sir."

"And two geniuses are better than one. So they're staying here and we're taking this rotter down."

"Yes, sir."

"Right-ho. That's settled then." I strode back to where Holmes and Watson were finishing a private conversation in a manner similar to the one Jeeves and I had just engaged in. "You can stay as long as you like," I said to them.

Watson looked at Holmes then nodded meaningfully at me. Holmes cocked one eyebrow. "Before we accept, I must ask if you understand the risks."

"Absolutely," I replied without hesitation.

"Roberson is a cold-blooded murderer. If you permit us to remain under your roof, you are putting your life and the life of your manservant in danger."

I looked to Jeeves. It was one thing for me to risk my own life, another thing entirely for me to risk Jeeves's. His expression was calm and resolute; he inclined his head towards me. "I appreciate your concern, but I have full confidence in Jeeves's ability to keep us safe from harm."

"Very well, we accept your generous offer."

"Jolly good. Now, to sleep. I'll have Jeeves make up the guest room and-" I stopped as I remembered that I wasn't supposed to know about the state of affairs between Holmes and Watson. Besides which, the last time I'd seen them for any length of time they were a bit pipped with each other. Although their tempers were cooler now than they'd been two days ago, it was entirely possible that they wouldn't want to share a room. "Oh wait, there's only one guest room. You surely don't want to share one guest room. Perhaps Dr. Watson can take the…no, that doesn't work…Jeeves will take my room and I'll take…wait, no…" I was tying my brain up in knots searching for a solution to the dilemma. Just when I thought we'd have to recourse to someone sleeping in the sitting room��"that someone being me, seeing that I couldn't very well be so rude as to deny my guests a mattress, and I couldn't imagine Jeeves willing to give up his privacy to take his forty winks on the chesterfield��"Jeeves jumped in and salvaged things, as usual.

"I shall handle the matter, sir," he said. I waved my hand at him to indicate that he should proceed as best he saw fit. "Will you be availing yourself of a bed tonight, Mr. Holmes?" Jeeves asked.

Watson jumped into the conversation. "You really ought to, Holmes. The immediate crisis is over and you need rest."

"Doctor's orders?" Holmes scoffed.

"If you like."

Holmes sighed begrudgingly. "Far be it from me to disobey my physician." His words were conciliatory yet carried the hint of a mordant edge.

Jeeves gestured towards the guestroom. "In that case, gentlemen, if you will follow me." With that he led them both away. I toddled off to my own room to put on my cerulean pyjamas, knowing that Jeeves would soon return to assist me. Indeed, not five minutes later, he was in my room turning down the bedclothes.

I crawled under the covers and wriggled with pleasure. I don't know if you've slept in a chair, perhaps to the accompaniment of a particularly dull teacher, but if you have not, then let me tell you that it's not a very comfortable experience, especially when it's not just a short nap while the history master drones on about the Civil Wars, but an entire night spent trying to get your eight hours while seated. A soft mattress and smooth sheets, therefore, were like the fluffy clouds of heaven upon which angels sleep by comparison. I watched Jeeves pluck my cast-off garments from the floor and put them in the hamper and knew that all was as it had been before the kidnapping. Merely watching Jeeves glide about the room, being his wonderful, Jeevesian self, made my heart skip a beat in my chest. I wished I could find an excuse to keep him near me longer, but my sorry brain was uncooperative, failing to come up with an innocuous task for Jeeves to perform.

As Jeeves was leaving, he turned in the doorway and said, "Good night to you, sir."

"Good night, Jeeves," I replied.

He turned off the light and departed. The room was dark, and not just in the prosaic, lightless sort of way that a room is dark when the lights are off, but in a silent, forlorn sort of way when the person who is the light of your life has up and left. I lay morose and wakeful. Suddenly the bed didn't seem as comfortable any more. I tossed and turned first to one side, and when that proved no better, tried my luck with the other. But no matter what position I put myself in, I could not find rest, not when there were so many things I wanted to say but dared not.

As I pondered my quandary, the significance of Jeeves's actions earlier this evening hit me like the proverbial tonne of bricks. He had blithely escorted Holmes and Watson to the same guestroom, ergo, Jeeves must also be cognizant of their arrangement and, at least implicitly, was in full support of it. That, when combined with the tender look he gave me back when he helped me out of Roberson's lair, indicated that Bertram W. Wooster might actually have a chance of successfully courting one Reginald Jeeves. At the very least, his treatment of Holmes and Watson made it clear that if I'd misread the Jeevesian psychology vis a vis Self, I'd suffer no worse than utter humiliation and abject heartbreak. In short, I trusted that he'd not ring up the police or use the knowledge to bring down the good Wooster name.

There were obstacles, of course. For one thing, he was in my employ, and inequity of that sort is rife with the potential for abuse. His livelihood was in my hands and I could never be so dishonourable as to take advantage and press my unwanted attentions on his person, even if his marvellous intellect was a source of awe and delight to me, and the sight of his broad shoulders shifting under his black coat or sunlight glinting on his brilliantined head set my heart all a-flutter.

Under normal circs, I'd set the problem before Jeeves and he'd straighten the whole thing out. I was leery to do so in this case for obvious reasons, but in the end I decided that there was no better course, and since the problem concerned Jeeves himself, it was only right to involve him in the search for a solution. With that decided, I rose from my bed, wrapped myself in my dressing gown and set forth to seek out Jeeves.
