“Show me the list of Horcruxes.”

Harry set in on the table between them.

“Riddle’s diary, check. Slytherin’s locket, well, we know where it is, at least. Marvolo’s ring?”

Both boys snickered, thinking of Dumbledore’s wizened hand.

“Taken care off,” Harry said, ticking it with a flourish. “Hufflepuff’s cup?”

“Whereabouts unknown.”

“It’s going to be a bitch to find.”

Severus nodded. “Gryffindor’s item?”

“We know of two possible candidates, maybe more. Shut up, Sev,” Harry said as Severus sniggered.

“How did you manage to pull Gryffindor’s sword from the hat?”

“Dumbledore told me I had many qualities Godric Gryffindor valued in people,” Harry whispered, vaguely ashamed.

“Not true. You’ve got a brain, for starters.”

Harry threw a crumpled sheet of parchment at Severus, who yelped when the ball passed through him.

“Okay. The sword or the hat. We’ll have to check those,” Harry said.

“You realise they’re both in Dumbledore’s office? And that it might be something else entirely?”

“One step at a time, Severus. I won’t climb that mountain until I have to. So, only one left, if Dumbledore’s hypotheses are correct. Ravenclaw’s item, whatever it is.”

Severus suddenly looked embarrassed.

“Sev? What is it? Sev! What’s the problem?”

Severus floated down until he was sitting on the same bench as Harry. He looked at his hands, knotted on his lap.

“There was a small eagle statuette found near your cot, when your parents were. . .”

Harry frowned. “He wanted to use my death to make a Horcrux? Well, I didn’t know, but it’s not completely unexpected.”

“You don’t understand, Harry. The statuette is not a Horcrux.”

“But once the spell is cast, it can’t be repelled. If it’s not the statuette, then what. . . is. . . it. . .? Oh.”

“Now you get it.” Severus’s voice was unexpectedly tight.

“‘Power the Dark Lord knows not.’” Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his face. “I suppose he’s not aware of it.”

“I suppose not. Harry. . .”

Harry’s eyes were damp and he rubbed them furiously.

“Don’t. . . Maybe. . . maybe I can come back as a ghost. . .”

Harry slipped into the trance-like state. Severus launched on his projection as soon as it appeared and hugged him tight. Harry buried his head in the crook of Severus’s neck, relishing the familiar feeling of Severus’s hair tickling his face, his long, fine hand rubbing his back, his voice whispering nonsense in his ear.
