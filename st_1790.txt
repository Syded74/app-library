<b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"AAAAEIIIIIHHHHHGGGGHHHH!!!!!&nbsp;
Fucking bloody Hell - that fucking hurt, Gwen"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"I warned you it might sting,&nbsp;
Harriet.&nbsp; And don't be such a booby.&nbsp; How do you think you would
cope if&nbsp; you ever had real hardship to put up with?&nbsp; It's your
fault any way for having such soft skin in that region.&nbsp; You get no
sympathy from me.&nbsp; I take you out for a nice ride and you almost get
us arrested and then you make this silly fuss as soon as we get back!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>Gwendoline put back the top
on the bottle of surgical spirits and bent down and kissed the affected
area, and then transferred her attentions to Harry's clitoris, which she
caressed with her tongue for a few minutes,&nbsp; Harriet&nbsp; responding
more and more affectionately until the pair of them gradually became enmeshed
in a tangle of arms and legs.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>Harriet finally extricated
herself, and ran her fingers through Gwen's hair. (That on her head, that
is!)</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"I love you,&nbsp; Gwendoline
Foxe, I really do love you.&nbsp; What was this revelation you had after
that fat pompous Sergeant read you that lecture, out there?"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"Setting an example to others,
Harriet.&nbsp; How can we do that when we only go about naked inside my
grounds?&nbsp; There is a whole world out there which needs to be educated
to enjoy being the way we two are!&nbsp; We have been so selfish in keeping
it to ourselves and Jenkins &amp; Co.&nbsp; And I am going to start with
this locality.&nbsp; When we have the General Meeting, I am going to end
the day by having a nude ball in my house and the local youth will be invited
to come along.&nbsp; I'll get the notices printed and sent here by special
messenger tomorrow and you can deliver them around the village!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"Not naked, I hope, Gwen!&nbsp;
That really would get me arrested!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>Gwen frowned for a few minutes.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"No, Harry, but I must think
of some suitable apparel for you.&nbsp; I was quite good at dressmaking
once.&nbsp; I think a nice bikini would do.&nbsp; Let me get my tape measure
and we'll soon get you fitted out!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>After Gwen had finished measuring
Harry she gave out a low whistle.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"Gosh, darling, but you really
are starting to fill out nicely!&nbsp; Let me feel those biceps again!&nbsp;
Oh, yes!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>After this encouraging news
a gratified Harriet needed much less persuading to brave the&nbsp; villagers'
stares on the morrow and she went out to continue digging, while Gwen looked
out her sewing machine and hunted around for suitable material.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>...................................................................................................</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"Not a lot of it is there,
Gwen?&nbsp; The bottom looks like you made it out of dental floss!&nbsp;
I'd say it just about covers the vital parts and no more, always assuming
my bum is not a vital part!&nbsp;&nbsp; And my bush sticks out - can't
I give it a&nbsp; tiny bit of a trim?</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"NO! - you bloody can't.&nbsp;
I'm not having you mutilated.&nbsp; There's nothing illegal about a few
hairs poking out - I hope!&nbsp; And now take it off, darling&nbsp; until
tomorrow.&nbsp; I'm missing the sight of those lovely lovely&nbsp; tits
already."</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>...................................................................................................</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>Next morning Harriet&nbsp;
looked over Gwen's shoulder and read one of the printed invitations which
she was to deliver later.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"By kind permission of the
Countess, a ball will be held at the Hall on Saturday 5th March&nbsp;&nbsp;
for the youth of this village, starting at 7.00 pm.&nbsp; Clothing&nbsp;
will be optional and discouraged and attendance&nbsp; restricted to those
between the ages of eighteen and twenty five.&nbsp; It is hoped that many
more boys than girls will attend as fifty nude girls are likely to be present
in addition to the residents of the village.&nbsp; Admission,&nbsp; food
and alcoholic refreshment will all be free."</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"That'll teach that fucking
obese pig of a Sergeant to read me pontificating lectures!" chortled&nbsp;
a delighted Gwen.&nbsp; Off you go Harry - I don't have time to drive you
to the village, and anyway the exercise will be good for you!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>An indignant Gwen had refused
Harry permission to wear shoes and by the time she had walked across the
dew laden fields her feet were wet and covered in mud and bits of grass.&nbsp;
They were also rather cold - it was still February - and Spring had not
yet sprung, even if the temperature was now getting quite a bit above freezing.&nbsp;
Even with the cover afforded by the satchel full of leaflets slung over
her back, the fact that both her generously rounded posterior hemispheres
were open to the air was obvious to all who cared to look, and they were
legion!</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>To say that her presence in
the sleepy village,&nbsp; attired as if for a day on the beach in high
summer,&nbsp; caused a bit of a stir, would be an understatement, and a
knot of small boys soon formed and followed her, cheering and laughing&nbsp;
from house to house as she delivered the invitations and pinned one to
the door of the Village Hall.&nbsp; Net curtains twitched as scandalised
ladies watched in horror and disgust as the muscular, beautiful and semi
naked&nbsp; Harriet carried out her appointed task.&nbsp; At least one
young gentleman, emerging from home to go off to work, went back into his
house,&nbsp; feeling a sudden need to manipulate his aroused manhood.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>Harriet wondered what this
would do to Gwendoline's good relations with the Rector as she pushed a
leaflet through the&nbsp; Rectory door.&nbsp; She knew that the Reverend
Mr.&nbsp; Merryweather had two children of an age to be eligible to come
to the ball, a daughter of twenty one and a son of nineteen.&nbsp; She
doubted, though,&nbsp; that either would turn up!</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>...........................................................................................................................................................</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"Mission accomplished Harry?"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"All safely delivered, my
darling.&nbsp; A very interesting and highly enjoyable morning - I think
I might have a future as an exhibitionist!&nbsp; I sure caused a bit of
devastation to one or two young men - they'll certainly be flocking up
here to see more!"</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial Black"><font size=+2>"Good!&nbsp; Now come here
and be rewarded my sweet!&nbsp; Get that bikini off first, though!&nbsp;
You're looking very overdressed!"</font></font></b>
